AGARfCUS (LEPIOTA) GEOliGINJi; A NEW SPECIES OF 
AGARICUS.
Ey WORTHINGTON G.
SMITH, E.L.S.
(Plate CXII.) 
This elegant and curious Lepiota differs from any species hitherto de- 
scribed.
Its specific characters are sufficient to distinguish it from the 
other Lepiotre, but with the exception of one or two plants of the group, it 
may be readily recognized by its parasitic habit, the members of the sub- 
genus, with the exceptions referred to, being all terrestrial.
It is probably 
exotic, perhaps of Eastern origin, as I have not met with it elsewhere 
than in the cool fernery at Messrs.
Veitch and Sons' Nursery, at Chelsea.
It does not come up in the stoves and hothouses like some exotic species 
of Lepiota, but is confined exclusively to the cool fernery, where it may be 
found all through the year on different species of Mosses which grow 
amongst British Ferns and other hardy plants.
Judging from its liabitat, 
it seems reasonable to suppose that it may have been introduced with 
some of Messrs.
Veitch's extensive importations from Japan and neigh- 
bouring territories.
It comes into Fries's section " Clypeolarii," and its nearest allies are^.
Badhami, B.
and Br., and A.
Melear/ris, Sow. One of its most striking 
peculiarities is its instantaneous change of colour from snow-white to 
blood-red when touched.
So sensitive is it, that when gently laid with 
the pileus downwards on paper, the part of the surface in contact with the 
paper immediately changes colour, and if rolled over, it leaves a brilliant 
carmine stain wherever it touches.
The portions of the gills nearest the 
^^ stem are usually crimson, merely from accidentally coming in contact with 
^i^ the stem to which they are closely approximated though free.
The red 
• — ' colour ultimately becomes dark brown, and after the lapse of a few hours 
from gathering, the Agaric loses its property of changing colour.
Several 
other Lepiota change colour, but none have the remarkable sensitiveness 
,^^ of this species.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE SPECIES OF POTTIA ALLIED TO 
P. TRUNCATA, WITH DESCEIPTIONS OF THREE NEW 
SPECIES.
By William Mitten, A.L.S, 
A specimen of the Pottia, mentioned by Dr. Braithwaite in the Au- 
gust number of this Journal, having been sent to me by Mr. Davies with a 
request that I would examine it, I have found it necessary in so doing to 
reinspect ray specimens and to look over the descriptions of the species.
" Pottia " has been generally accepted as the generic name for a group 
of species, chiefly European, all which have an intimate agreement among 
themselves in their mode and places of growth as well as their small size, 
foliage, and general appearance ; originally it was intended to include 
Gymnostomous species only, and those forms in Avhich a peristome is de- 
veloped were considered distinct and placed in the genus Anacalypta or 
TFeissia.
In Mueller's Synopsis, Anacalypta is reduced to a section of 
Pottia, and in Schimper's ' Synopsis of the European Musci,' although 
both genera are first employed, at the end of the work it is admitted that 
they must be united.
These Mosses, with some other analogous species in other natural groups, 
offer great difficulties to the learner : it was formerly easy to examine the 
capsule for a peristome, — if it had none, the species might be Pottia, if, how- 
ever, a peristome was present, it must belong to some other genus ; if the 
peristome had short teeth, it might be Anacalypta, but when the teeth 
were elongated it became Desmatodon.
Individuals of the same species 
differ greatly in the amount of the peristome ; in some examples the pe- 
ristome is a short membrane with or without the rudiments of teeth at 
its upper edge, and between this and the comparatively complete peristome 
proper to Anacalypta every gradation may be found.
These gradations 
in the development of an organ upon which not a few genera have been 
established, lead to the question where is the most completely developed 
peristome to be found among Mosses evidently most closely related to 
Pottia ?
The answer must be, in that group of the genus Torlula to which 
Syntrichia belongs, and the distinctions upon which Anacalypta, Besma- 
todon, and Trichostomum rest are barely of use as sections, for they fail 
to bring together the most nearly related species in every other particular 
except peristome.
In several of the Pottias, even when the capsule is de- 
stitute of peristome, the cells of the opercidum are seen to be arranged in 
a twisted manner, so that — as stated in the " Musci Indici " (Journ.
of the 
Linn.
Soc. 1859), and since by Lindberg in his review of the European 
Trichostoma — the peristome, if developed, must be also twisted or the teeth 
ascend obliquely, as is commonly the case in Tortida.
OBSERVATIONS ON THE SPECIES OF POTTIA.
3 
To return from this digression : it will be best to spenk of these Mosses 
under the name of Pottla, as being that by which they are best known, 
and the British species may be separately distinguished in the following 
manner : — 
Leaves with accessory lamellte on the nerve 1.
P. cavifolia.
Leaves without accessory lamellae.
Calyptra scabrous.
Leaves obtuse 2.
P. Wilsoni.
Leaves acute 3.
P. Starkeana.
Calyptra smooth.
Leaves serrulate towards the apex.
Nerve not excurrent 4.
P. Seimii.
Nerve excurrent 5.
P. lanceolata.
Leaves quite entire.
Peristome always present 6.
P. ccespitosa.
Peristome almost unknown.
Leaves in 5 rows.
Leaves smooth.
Capsule turbinate 7.
P. truncata.
Capsule oval-cylindric 8.
P. Httoralis.
Leaves rough 9.
P. asperula.
Leaves in 8 rows.
Nerve excurrent into a long point 10.
P. crinita.
Nerve forming a short point 11.
P. viridifolia.
1. P.
ccivifoUa, Ehrh., or rather as it should be P.
pusilla, Hedw., is a 
well-marked species from the presence on the inner side of the nerve of 
the leaf of narrow lamellae ; in this it agrees with a species not yet de- 
tected in Britain, P.
subsessilis, Brid., which from having its calyptra 
split on several sides forms the genus Phnromitrumi, Schimper, Synopsis, 
p. 121 ; the resemblance is, however, so great that a natural arrangement 
must keep them in one genus.
The variety of P.
pusilla, with an elon- 
gated seta and capsule, enumerated in the ' Bryologia Britannica ' as var.
S. gracilis, has the peristome of Desmatodon, which may be dissected 
out of the operculum, it is then the Barbida cavifolia, Schimper, Syn- 
opsis, p.
734, and the Tortula lamellata, Lindberg, De Tortulis, etc.
Having gathered this form, my own opinion is that it is only a more com- 
plete state of P.
pusilla, at the same time it must be admitted that interme- 
diate states have not yet been found.
Closely allied also to P.
pusilla, are 
Desmatodon nervosus, which has the peristome variable in length and is 
really a Tortula, and T.
chloronotos, Brid.
2. P.
Wilsoui, Hook., with its obscure octofarious leaves, is a very dis- 
tinct species ; British specimens show hardly a trace of peristome, but 
others gathered at Hyures, by Sir W.
C. Trevelyan, have a narrow mem- 
brane wilhin the mouth of the capsule.
The inflorescence is probably 
subject to variation, for the antheridia are sometimes included in a small 
bud as well as being free in the axils of the comal leaves.
My specimen 
of the Entothymenium mucronifolium, MuelL, is certainly P.
Wilsoni, and' 
is only a little more complete state than the French specimens ; this syno- 
nym should, therefore, be removed to its proper place.
3. P.
Starkeana, Hedw., or Anacalypta Starkeana, including its gym- 
nostomous form, P.
miniitula, and its intermediate states, Weissia qffinis.
Hooker and Taylor, or var.
hrachyodm, is variable in the length of its 
capsule, which, when very long, is also as often gymnostomous as the states 
in which it is shorter, and presents every gradation in the amount of its 
development of peristome, from none to that attributed to Anacalypta.

4 OBSERVATIONS ON THE SPECIES OF POTTIA.
Wilson (Bryol.
Brit.
p. 98) candidly admits that lie " dares not pronounce 
P. Starkeana and P.
mbudula distinct ;" yet has kept the two forms in 
the presumed distinct genera.
The scabrous calyptra escaped the notice 
of the authors of the ' Bryologia Europsea.' 
4. P.
Heimii, Hedw., easily distinguished by its leaves, varies greatly 
in the length of its capsule, but although frequent search has been made 
for a peristome, in promising specimens none has been found.
5. -P.
lanceolata, Hedw.
(^Anacalypta lcinceolata~), although described 
with entire leaves, has always some trace of minute crenation near where 
its nerve is excurrent from the apex of its leaves.
This species is very 
variable in its peristome, when gymnostomous it is probably Gymnosto- 
mnm intermedium.
Turner, and of Schwsegrichen, Supp.
t. 7, a form com- 
monly referred to P.
truncata, from which it may be distinguished by the 
crenation of the margin and rough cells of its leaves.
The Desmatodon 
Giiepini (Bryol.
Europ.
DesmatodoH, t.
4) can hardly be other than a more 
complete form ; no character is given in the description by which it could 
be safely distinguished.
6. P.
Cfvspitosa, Bruch, is unlikely to be confounded with any other 
species excepting P.
Starkeana, and from this it differs immediately in the 
smooth calyptra.

trimcata, Bryol.

dioicous, — a fact which seems to have been overlooked ; it is certainly the 
G. trimcatum oi t\\e Bryol.

9. f.
8. This species has acute 
entire leaves with smooth cells ; it varies greatly in its capsule, which is, 
however, always as wide at the mouth as it is lower down, and its usual 
form is turbinate ; forms with an elongated capsule are probably in herba- 
ria confused with the gymnostomous state of P.
lanceolata.
Mueller 
says in his ' Synopsis,' p.
554, that he has met with the peristome.
8. P.
littoralis, n.
sp.
; leaves oblong-subspathulate, obtuse or acute, 
the lower ones pale, the upper green ; cells in the upper part of the leaf 
about half the size of those of P.
truncata, hence more obscure, smooth ; 
lower cells oblong, pellucid ; nerve excurrent, longer in the inferior leaves ; 
capsule oblong- oval, mouth less than the greatest diameter; operculum 
rostrate, slightly twisted ; male flower bud-like.
Hab. Aldrington, near 
Brighton, Sussex, growing with P.
Heimii, also at Hastings.
The oval 
capsule, not dilated at the mouth, gives this Moss a greater similitude 
to P.
lanceolata than to P.
truncata, but from this it difiers in the smooth 
leaves.
I formerly mistook this Moss for P.
crinita, from which it differs 
in the quinquefarious arrangement of its leaves, and much shorter and 
more slender nerve, as well as in its smooth cells.
9. P.
asperula, n.
sp.
; leaves obovate-spathulate, acute, but not acu- 
minate ; nerve excuiTent into a short point, upper cells rounded, rather 
obscure, each with several elevated points, lower cells oblong, smooth, 
pellucid ; capsule oval ; operculum rostrate ; cells slightly twisted ; an- 
theridia naked in the axils of comal leaves.

Penzance, in several places, Mr. Curnow ; Jersey, M.
Piquet ; also in 
Wilson's Muse.
Brit, with P.
truncata, n.

This has more obscure 
leaves than P.
truncata, and when they are bent over under the microscope 
the roughness of the cells is easily perceived.
The capsule is not so wide 
at tha mouth as it is about its middle.
It is possible that this species 
may be sometimes confused with P.
lanceolata, when that species is gym- 
nostomous, but it has many points of difference.

P. crin'da, Wils., is generally very readily distiuguishecl from its 
allies by the long hair-like points of its leaves, which are obtuse, and its 
oval transparent capsule showing the sporangium not contiguous with the 
external walls ; in its octofarious leaves it agrees with P.
Wilsoni, but 
ditfers by its smooth calyptra, and in the areolation of its leaves.

nerve not very stout, excurrent into a short point ; n)argin recurved 
about the middle ; cells in the upper part hexagonal or nearly square, 
their external walls with minute protuberances, obscure with chlorophyll, 
lower cells oblong, hyaline", smooth; seta short; capsule oblong; lid 
rostrate; antheridia in the axils of the comal leaves.
Hab. Plymouth, 
Mr. Holmes ; also in Wilson's Muse.
Brit., amongst additional specimens 
of P.
crinita.
From P.
crlnita this differs in its larger and wider leaves, 
with the upper cells less obscure and less evidently tuberculated, the lower 
cells less elongated, and the short and slender nerve.
P. pallida, Liudberg, belongs to this section of the arrangement, 
which is described in his review of the European Tortula and Trlcho- 
stoiiifB as having octofarious, panduriform leaves with cells " Irevissimis," 
the nerve long and fragile, the seta " aureoflava " ; capsule " cylindrico- 
oblonga," gymnostomous ; operculum rostrate, indistinctly twisted ; calyp- 
tra smooth ; antheridia in the axils of the comal leaves.
This was gathered 
on the coast of Spain, and, from the precision of the description, must be 
distinct from all our British species.

A FEW NOTES ON MR.
WATSON'S 'COMPENDIUM OF THE 
CYBELE BRITANNICA.' 
By Hon. J.
L. Warren, M.A., F.L.S.
The following rough notes and queries on Mr. Watson's admirable 
Compendium, are oifered with some hesitation.
They supplement the 
distribution (cliiefly as regards the province of ^Mersey) of a few aggregate 
species and several subspecies.
So many waifs and strays of alien vege- 
tation have of late years been battering for admission at the doors of the 
London Catalogue, that I have ventured to illustrate, by some instances 
within my own observation, the tenacity and facility with which certain 
manifest aliens, colonists, and denizens have maintained their ground and 
rapidly multiplied their individuals in given spots within very limited 
periods of time : — 
Callitriche platycarpa, Kiitz.
(p.
173.) — "Localities insufficiently on 
record." Confirm province 9.
Tabley Lake, on the authority of Professor 
Hegelmaier, to whom I submitted a specimen thence.
C. hamulata, 
Kiitz., and C.
autimmalis, L., were also verified by him from the same 
piece of water.
This is the most southern English' station for the latter; 
but as Anacharis is increasing in Tabley Lake, the CalUtricJie is rather 
difficult to find now.
I found it, however, again, plentifully on the mud 
of Holford mill-dam, let oft' this year for repairs, some two miles west of 
the original station in the new edition of E.
Bot., " near Tabley Lake boat- 
house." 
Verbascum virgatum, With.
(p.
253.) — Add province 9, within a curved 
enclosure.
Twenty or thirty of these plants appeared in a clover-field in 
Plumley, near Northwich, in 1868 and 1869.
Last year the field was 
already ploughed up when I visited it.
'COMPENDIUM OF THE CYBELE BRITANNICA.
7 
Mentha piperita, Hiuls.
(p.
2GS.) — Usually considered a Chesliire na- 
tive, and I have certainly found it four or live times within the county, 
but always under circumstances of suspicion.
Once in a little Willow- 
bed just opposite a farmhouse ; again, in a hedge-ditch, where I learnt a 
cottage and garden had once stood ; then by the side of a runnel, with a 
farm-garden a little above it, etc.
Galeopsis versicolor.
Curt.
(p.
275.) — On the question of this being " a 
boreal variety of Tetrahit^'' note that it is perhaps the most characteristic 
and widespread flower of central Cheshire.
The potato-fields, which it 
affects most, are often covered for roods with it.
There is plenty of G.
Tetrahit also, and they often grow together; but I never saw the slightest 
approach to intermediates between the two, and alive they are abundantly 
and I should say " specifically" distinct.
It is only in the herbarium 
that likeness begins.
Chenopodium fcifoUum, Sm.
(p.
293.) — Add province 9, within a round 
bracket for greater caution ; observed twice about rubbish and in a garden 
in the environs of the city of Chester this year, but nothing like so well 
established there as round London.
After all, is this Chenopod a better 
native than Merciirialis annua and Sinapis muralis, plants to me of 
similar claims and environment ?
Three years ago I raised from Kilburn 
seeds a few plants of Cjicifolium at Tabley.
It has even in this short 
space spread as a weed in different places through a kitchen-garden of two 
acres.
Riimex sanguineus and Datura Stramouiam have also maintained 
themselves there for many years in spite of hoeing and weeding.
Atriplex erecta, Huds.
(p.
296.) — If this includes or equals A.
serrata, 
Syme, province 9 (Cornfields about Knutsford) may be confidently added.
Mr. Syme named thus for me our prevalent iqu-ight field Atriplex.
Rumex pratensis, M.
and K.
(p.
302.) — Add province 9.
Several places 
in Tabley Hill Lane and clsewliere.
I found the plant in Mersey as soon 
as I luul learnt it in Middlesex.
I fancy it occurs nearly everywhere, if 
known and looked for.
HippopJiae rhamnoides, L.
(p.
304.) — Is this ever or to what extent an 
inland plant in England ?
It forms an abundant and characteristic vege- 
tation, lining and following the torrent-beds for miles in Switzerland, e.g.
near Culoz.
EmpetrHiii nigrum, L.
(p.
303.) — The comital distribution of this seems 
worth tracing minutely.
So large a slice of southern and central England 
wants reliable record of this plant, that any occurrence of it in zone 1 
may prove worth chronicling.
I was surprised to find Empetrum in a 
small marsh lying close into the town of Knutsford, on the south-east side, 
in the lieart of the plain of Cheshire, and miles from anything that can 
claim the name of a hill.
Of course, on the high lands of Cheshire, where 
Cheshire touches Yorkshire, running between Derbyshire and Lancashire, 
Empetrum is common enough, I should gladly know whether Stafford 
ancl Derby can show any records for Empetrum in their flat portions.
Qy.
Is not its climatic distribution curiously analogous to Vaccinium Vilis-Idrea 
to which I see zone 1 is denied ?
The presence of Empetrum, and former 
presence of Saxifraga Ilirculus at Knutsford, point to one fact ; they arc 
both relics of a much older flora, when perhaps continuous morasses con- 
nected the now highly cultivated plain of Cheshire with the hilly districts 
of the north-cast.
Mercuriulis annua, L.
(p.
309.) — I should say a colonist.
Still it is 
8 A FEW NOTES ON MR.
WATSON's ' COMPENDIUM.' 
curious to find it exactly in tlie same heterogeneous position, as it is about 
Eno;lish towns, e.
g. London, Brighton, etc.
; about Continental cities, e.g.
Paris, Florence, Rome ; there also it is a stranger still, but a stranger with 
recognized rights, and a quarter of its own.
Allium, ohraceum, L.
(p.
332.) — Add province 9.
In a field at Plum- 
ley, by Peover Eye Brook.
Several hundred plants annually.
Blysmus rufus.
Link.
(p.
359.) — As Lancashire seems the most southern 
record hitherto for this, it is worth adding Chester to bring the species to 
a lower comital point south.
It grows near the Shotwick rifle-butts, at a 
spot called " Sealaiids," near Chester.
Polygala eu-vnUjarls.
(p.
488.
"t — Add province 9 ; it grows by Peover 
Eye Brook, Holford, Chester, — P.
depressa, Wend, being much the com- 
moner local form, found, among many other places, in Tabley Park and 
Lower Peover Heath.
Ulex eu-nani(s, Syme.
(p.
497.) — I have gathered specimens near Lower 
Peover Heath, Chester, which I cannot distinguish from the typical form 
of Middlesex and Surrey heaths; but even at Lower Peover, as over 
nearly all Chester, U.
Gallii, Planch., is the common form.
Anthjllis Billenii, Schultz.
(p.
497.) — Province 2, Sussex.
Brighton 
racecourse.
Coroniila varia, L.
(p.
499.) — Province 1.
I found it in a wood above 
Dr. Freeman's house, at Soraerleaze, near Wells.
There was not much of 
it, and its presence there was no doubt accidental and casual.
I put this 
on record as this species seems to be now in this country beginning to 
establish itself.
Epilobium eu-tetragoninn^ E.
B. (p.
512.) — The northern limit may be 
extended to province 9, but I have only got one specimen from a lane in 
Lower Peover.
I gathered this as evidently not " obscurum ;" and sub- 
mitted it to Dr. Boswell Syme, who named it " eu-letragonuni." But 
'E.
obsciirmn, Schreb., is the prevalent form in the district round Knuts- 
ford, and I believe in Cheshire.
Saxifraga umbrosa, L.
(p.
517.) — It is perhaps worth.
notice that, from 
being evidently planted there a few years back, this has spread so much in 
many places in the pleasure-ground at Tabley, Knutsford, Chester, that 
any enthusiastic young botanist might hail it as a native there.
Jster Novi-Belgii, L.
(p.
583), has maintained itself for many years in 
a plausible-looking corner of Tabley Lower Water; but has evidently 
blown or floated across some two hundred yards of lake-water, where 
there is, and has been from very old times, a herb-garden.
Ambrosia maritima, L.
(not entered.) — Alien, casual; a single plant, 
in a clover-field in Plumley, near Northwich, Cheshire.
I could, however, 
find no other aliens in the field to indicate whence this curious stray had 
reached us; but probably the clover-seed was Italian; the field was a 
lonely one, and removed from any horticultural influence.
Veronica ]H-regrina, L.
(p.
540.) — Knutsford racecourse; evidently a 
casual.
Only a plant or two for a couple of years.
Not far from it Lfpi- 
diiim Braba, Medicago maculata, and C.
Bo7U(s-He)iricus have maintained 
themselves many years.
Still there, 1870.
Bartsia serotina, E.
B. 3 (p.
540.) — The Bartsia round Knutsford 
seems to me, who have studied both plants growing, sufliciently distinct 
as a " form " from the Bartsia of the cornfields round Brighton.
I used 
to call the Cheshire plant "serotina,'" the Brighton one " ternu ;" but 
THDNOGRAPII OF THE GENUS XIPHION.
9 
the Exchange specimens of Dr. Boswell-Syme seem to fix the names 
differently, as far as one can judge from dried specimens only.
Note also, 
that the Cheshire Bartaia is more a plant of the roadsides than of the 
cornfields.
Chenopodinm paganum, Eeich., and C.
viride, L.
(p.
553.) — Add pro- 
vince 9 for both, Knutsford.
" Polygonum nodosum," (p.
555.) — Mere Mere Edge, Cheshire.
A 
small, white-flowered semi-procumbent form, so named by an authority 
in whom much reliance may be placed.
It bears a few glands.
This is 
a very different state to the large, erect, dusky purple "nodosum" of our 
suburbs.
P. (aviculare) rurivagiim, .lord.
— Cornfields, common.
P. (avicidare) 
arewflsifz-MOT, Bor.
(p.
556).
Roadsides; common.
Both plentifnl round 
Knutsford.
Popidiis (tremula) glabra, E.
B. (p.
560.) — If you cut down a hedge 
of Aspens, the shoots froui the stoops, for the first year or two, bear leaves 
more like those of the black Poplar, and which you would never take for 
Aspen leaves if you had only an herbarium acquaintance with this tree.
These leaves of the young rods are silky beneath.
As tlie wood strength- 
ens and regains its tree size, the leaves become glabrous and assume the 
ordinary Aspen sbape.
Carex " involiita" (p.
591).
— I have gathered from several places in 
Pickmere, Tabley, and near Knutsford, specimens to me identical with 
those distributed by the Exchange Club under this name.
A Carex which 
is neither auipullacea nor vesicaria (though to me much nearer the former), 
will, I fancy, prove to have wide, though perhaps nowhere abundant, 
comital distribution in Cliester.
MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS XIPHION.
By J.
G. Baker, F.L.S.
In the present paper I propose to attempt to characterize and classify 
a small group of Iridaceoi inhabiting the Mediterranean region, Orient, 
and Abyssinia, the published information respecting ivhich is very much 
scattered, and when brought together needs a considerable amount of 
sifting and addition in order to make it accurate and complete.
The 
species are several of them old garden favourites, the synonymy of whicli 
might be traced back to Clusius, Parkinson, Besler, and the Bauhins.
The group, taking it as a whole, scarcely differs from Iris except in the 
character of the rootstock, which in Xiphion is a bulb and in Iris a 
rhizome.
Although in floral characters the two come so near to one 
another, yet, in making a key to the genera of this Order and its neigh- 
bours, it is so convenient to use the character of the rootstock as one of 
high importance, that I prefer in this matter to follow the example of 
Tournefort and Miller to thnt of Linnaeus, and to treat the two genera as 
distinct.
It will be seen from the synonymy that in the matter of generic 
circumscription the views which have been taken by later authors are 
extremely diverse, and that Xiphion, as here defined, includes three of the 
genera of the most recent monographer of the Order.

SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
Queries.
—Perhaps it may not be foreign to the design of the 
' Journal of Botany ' if I suggest the introduction to its pages of queries.
Difficulties, not to say problems, arise before all of us now and then, and 
when the query, with its solution from some one wiser than the querist, 
is of interest to botanists generally, it seems quite in order tliat it should 
be printed in these pages.
I therefore submit several queries which I 
shall be glad to have answered, and in reciprocity I shall be equally glad 
to contribute what I may be able in the shape of replies to the questions 
of others.
1. Do the common Periwinkles, Viuca major and V.
minor, ever ripen 
fruit in England ?
2. In the ' Botanical Eegister,' under Gratregm Oxyacantha, var.
Olive- 
riann, the common Hawthorn is said to have a black-fruited variety in 
English woods ; where does this variety exist wild ?

3. What is tlie pliysioloj;ic;il explanation of the acquired odour of 
Anthoxantlium, Aspenda udorat<f, Mtlilotus officinalis, and other plants 
when dried ?
[See short note on Coumarin, p.
18.] 
4. Does the common Sloe, Prunus spinom, ripen its fruit regularly, if 
not plentifully, in the midland counties ?
Near Manchester, upon clay, 
near the sandstone and millstone grit, 1 have scarcely ever seen this shrub 
in fruit, and then very sparingly.
Nothing is commoner in the hedges, 
or more conspicuous in its white bloom, in the month of April.
Upon 
the slate rocks not far from Dolgelly, North Wales, this last autumn the 
hedges were quite purpled with the fruit.
5. The green colour of plants is said to result always from the action 
of sunlight, and the want of sunlight, it is said, causes them to be deficient 
in green.
How is it that the cotyledons of the Sycamore are found to be 
a lively green when we strip off the hard and leathery carpel ?
Is the 
substance of the carpel in this instance translucent though opaque in 
seeming ?
What otlier instances are there of cotyledons being found green 
when the ripe seed is cut open ?
[Convolvidiis sepium and C.
Soldanella.} 
6. Are there any female Lombardy Poplars in England?
7. What amount of genuine ripe seed is produced by the female 
Willows and Poplars of our country, the male plants being often at very 
considerable distances, excepting only Snlix Caprcea, and perhaps another 
or two ?
Does the pollen get conveyed from one tree to the other ?
If 
so, by what agency ?
And what is the longest distance at which the 
female of a dioecious tree has been known to be fertilized from the male 
of the same species ?
Do the females of Poplars and Willows absolutely 
require the pollen from their ow n " species," or can they be fertilized by 
the pollen of some other species?

Any one who lias kept.
Wolffiu may have found 
after a while that many of the fronds become soft, dull, transparent, and 
of a pale yellow, and sink to the bottom of the water.
It was such plants 
that were found to be affected by the CijHtoslplion.
The mycelium of the 
parasite penetrates the cellular substance of the frond, and the methods of 
its reproduction are carefully described and figured.
There are two 
modes ; in the asexual mode, which resembles that of FyfMum ento- 
pliytum, described by Pringsheim in his ' Jahrbiicher,' vol.
i. p.
289 and 
t. 21, zoosporangia are formed in the peripheral cells of the frond, the 
outer wall of which is ultimately perforated by a slender tube emitted 
from them ; the extremity of the tube having reached the outer surface of 
the frond becomes enlarged and forms a vesicle, into which passes the 
fluid contents of the zoosporangium.
This soon divides into several por- 
tions, each of which becomes a ciliated zoospore.
On the rupture of the 
membrane of the mother-cell these escape into the surrounding water, and 
after active motion for twenty to fifty minutes settle down on the surface 
of other fronds of WolJJia, become spherical, acquire a cell-wall, lose their 
cilia, and germinate by sending out a mycelium, which penetrates the cell- 
walls of the host-plant.
Sexual reproduction is effected by oogonia and 
antheridia, the contents of which mingle, and that of the oogonium con- 
tracts into an oval mass (oospore), which soon becomes covered with a 
thick rugose covering.
Its further history has not been traced.

Though the

— I see Dr. Bull is said to liave first found 
this when on the " foray" in October last, but I found it several weeks 
before, and being- unable to make it agree with any species in our English 
books, I took it down to the Hereford Meeting, and called Mr. AVorthing- 
ton Smith's attention to the fact of its changing to a dark brown colour 
when cut, a peculiarity not mentioned as pertaining to any English

Protandry in Butomus umbellatus, L.
— During the summer of

The 
stamens are somewhat erect before the discharge of the pollen, but after- 
wards fall back upon the perianth.
A small globule of rather viscid, 
sweetish fluid appears between each carpel, and may probably attract 
insects for purposes either of cross- or .of self-ferlilization.

Monstrous G-rowth in a Cauliflower.
— A short time ago I 
received a cauliflower plant, of which the heart had been completely eaten 
out by the larvte of the stag-beetle, which infested the garden where it 
grew.
The injury had taken place when the plant was quite young, so 
that the scar was healed up; but, as is often the case when plants of 
the cabbnge tribe have been similarly injured, all further growth seemed 
to have been arrested ; and although the lower leaves remained green and 
healthy, there were no sprouts formed in their axils, nor any new shoots 
from the crown of the root.
When the plant was pulled up, however, a 
strange abnormal growth was found to have taken place in the root.
An 
immense number of buds had been produced from the lower part of the 
collar, and from the axils of many of the larger rootlets ; and these had 
pushed their way, not up into the air, as might have been expected, but 
downwards into the soil, forming a dense mass of underground shoots, 
bearing rudimentary leaves, and which, after penetrating the soil a short 
distance, began to turn upwards.
— Uobert Holland.
Thlaspi perfoliatum, L.
— This interesting plant is somewhat un- 
certain in its occurrence in its localities, and seems to prefer broken 
limestone not too much disintegrated.
Mr. H.
Boswell found it, how- 
ever, on cultivated ground near Woodstock, but on visiting the place with 
him another year we did not detect a single specimen.
In 1869 I met 
with it very plentifully on the bare sides of the embankment, and even 
on the ballast between the rails, of the Great Western llailway from the , 
Tetbury Road Station for about a mile towards Hayley Wood.
A patch 
of very fine individuals occurred on a roadside bank close to the village 
of Sapperton.
The Sapperton tunnel locality, first, I believe, given by 
Professor Buckmann, I did not verify ; it is somewhat ambiguous, as 
there are two tunnels at Sapperton, the lower one carrying the Thames 
and Severn Canal over the watershed of the two rivers.
Dr. St.
Brody, 
who visited the place with me, thought that a spoil heap over one of the 
shafts of the tunnel Avas the original locality, but w^e failed to find the 
plant there.

18 SHOKT NOTES AND QUERIES, 
CouMARiN is usually regarded as the clieraical rather ttian physio- 
logical cause of the vernal-grass odour devclo[)ed in the drying of some 
plants.
It is an interesting instance of a vegetable product formed arti- 
ficially.
Perkin replaced the hydrogen in salicyl-hydride (oil of Meadow- 
sweet) by sodium, and the sodium by acetyl.
The salicyl-acetylide, losing 
a molecule of water, becomes Coumarin.
(See Journ.
Chem.

]868, 
p. 54.) — W.
T. Thiselton Dyer.
CoUMARiNE.
— It lias been commonly asserted that coumarine exists 
ready-formed in some half-dozen odorous plants.
According to recent 
researches, however, it would seem that with one exception, that of the 
Tonquin Bean {Conmaroma odorata), these plants contain, not cou- 
marine, but a combination of that substance with hydrocoumaric acid.
Coumarine has a composition represented by the expression CgHgOg, and 
the natural compound of this, above referred to, may be formulated thus, 
CgHgOo, CgHgOg. Prom this compound, after it has been extracted 
from the plant by alcohol, coumarine itself may be obtained by the action 
of a cold solution of ammonia.
Coumarine has quite recently been formed 
artificially by Perkin.
He acts upon the oil of Meadow-sweet {Spirrea 
Ulmaria), which is the hydride of salicyle, by means of sodium.
He thus 
obtains a new substance, containing one atom of the metal sodium.
This new substance, acted upon by anhydious acetic acid, yields a com- 
pound named hydride of aceto-salicyle, which, when distilled, loses an 
atom of water and becomes coumarine ; thus — 
C^H.Oa, C3H3O - H2O = CgHgOg 
Hydride of aceto-saUcyle.
Coumarine.
According to some new experiments of my own, coumarine appears to 
exist, to a small extent, ready formed in the fresh leaves of the Northern 
Holy-grass {Hierocliloe borealis), as well as in the Tonquin Bean.
The 
compound of coumarine above mentioned has been found in Asperula 
odorata, Angrcecum fragrans, Antlioxanthum odoratum, and Melilotus offi- 
cinalis.
The odour of these four plants becomes developed or more 
distinct on drying, some of the coumarine being thus probably set free.

Irish Plants.
— Seduin daHyphyUum ; are we right in calling this cer- 
tainly introduced ?
It grows in a station hitherto unrecorded, near 
Midleton, county Cork, where it has every appearance of being truly wild, 
being abundant all over a group of low, rocky (limestone) hills in a retired 
spot.
Festuca Mi/urns (Sm.) ; this is in Cyb. Hib., called very rare, 
only two stations being recorded for all Ireland.
This certainly requires 
correction ; the species is abundant in Cork, and has no doubt been 
hitlierto confounded with F.
sciuroides (Roth).
Galium erectnm ; this 
species (in Cyb. Hib., Dublin only) grows abundantly in a pasture field 
near Midleton.
It is also to be found sparingly on hilly pasture near 
Ballinacurra — introduced, I do not doubt.

Monstrous state of Inflorescence in Brassica nigra, Boiss.

of this plant, some with their inflorescence very remarkably modified.

say modified, inasmncii as in every case, the plants were obviously affected 
by a minute wliite fungns, to which the changes from the normal state 
were no doubt due.
As I was obliged at the time to put the specimens 
in spirit for future examination, I can say nothing about the fungus itself; 
it may, perhaps, have l)een Uredo Candida, whicli ]\Iasters states (' Ve- 
getable Teratology,' p.
279; to be a common cause of Chloranthy in Cru- 
cifers.
Similar monstrosities seem to have come under Dr. Masters's 
notice, but I think mine sufficiently interesting for detailed description.
The lower part of the rachis was normal in its appearance in every case, 
and bore ordinary immature pods.
The upper part, however, measuring 
about three inches more or less, was very much hypertrophied, being about 
half an inch in thickness ; all the flowers belonging to it were abortive.
Where the hypertrophy had not been quite symmetrieal, the axis was a 
good deal curled and twisted.
The most curious feature was the change 
produced in the flowers.
In one instance there was a kind of corymb of 
chloranfhous flowers, each about half the natural size.
In all the otiier 
cases, the flowers, with one, or very rarely two exceptions, were completely 
atrophied, while those which were not atrophied were very much hpyer- 
trophied, measuring quite an inch across.
This kind of balance between 
the atrophy and hypertrophy is somewhat curious if we look upon the 
enlargements as due to the growth of a mycelium in the tissues.
The 
pedicel of the enlarged flower was genei-ally about 1 m.
long and 
^ in.
thick.
The sepals were spreading, each oblong, about \ in.
long, 
very fleshy,* and united at the base, occasionally forming a kind of 
dilated calyx-tube.
The petals which, like the other parts of the flower 
were green, were twice their normal length, spathulate in form and with 
laciniale margins.
The stamens in the flowers which were most symme- 
trically modified, were more or less distinctly eigJd and in two whorls, 
the outer opposite the sepals, the inner opposite the petals ; all were 
about the same length when equally developed.
The anther was represented 
by a kind of hooded leafy appendage turned upwards with a short, thumb- 
like claw, projecting from the opposite side of the filament.
The ovary 
was about an inch in length, but except for its enlargement and the thick- 
ness of its walls, not otherwise altered; the ovules were larger than usual, 
but immatru-e.

100° Cent, until they ceased to lose weight.
The total weight of water 
determined in this manner was found to be equal to (1) 63"4 per cent, of 
the total weight of the leaves employed.

Quantity of water which 
can be removed from the leaves by calcium chloride and sulphuric acid 
in vacuo.
(2.) Quantity of water which can be removed from the leaves by cal- 
cium chloride, 5'08 per cent.
(3.) Ditto, sulphiu'ic acid in vacuo, 6'09 per cent.
By placing leaves in the sun, and allowing the fluid to transpire, only a 
limited quantity could be obtained, equal to (4) 5"8 per cent.
— III.
Amount of transpirable fluid in the stem and leaves at a given time.
The 
uniformity of the results obtained above led to the conclusion that all the 
fluid in the plant did not, at a given time, exist in a transpirable condi- 
tion.
If, therefore, a quantity of fluid was transpired, and the loss sup- 
plied with some fluid easily detected in the plant, it followed that by 
causing, say, 7 per cent, of fluid to be transpired, the fluid used to 
replace that transpired ought to be found in every part of the branch.
Lithium citrate in dilute solution was employed for the purpose.
The 
lithium was then tested for by means of the spectroscope, and it was 
found that when 7"58 per cent, of fluid had been transpired by the leaves, 
the lithium could be detected all through the branch.
The amount of 
transpirable fluid in the stem and leaves seems, therefore, to be about 
(5) 6 or 7 per cent., while the fluid in relation to the cell-sap will be (6) 
from 56 to 57 percent.
— IV.
Rapidity of transpiration in sunlight, diffused 
daylight, and darkness.
Three sets of experiments were made, each 
lasting for one hour.
In another series the branches were placed in dark- 
ness for forty-eight hours.
The results are as follows : — 
(7.) Rapidity of transpiration in sunlight, one hour, 3-03 per cent.
(8.) Ditto, diffused daylight, 059 percent.
(9.) Ditto, darkness, 0'-±5 per cent.
Branches placed in darkness for forty-eight hom's in ^n ordinary atmosphere 
gave oft" a mean of (10) 13-47 per cent, in forty-eight hom-s.
— V.
Amount 
of fluid transpired in a saturatetl and in a dry atmosphere in the sun and 
in diftused daylight.
In conducting these experiments, care was taken 
to have them done at the same time, so that the external condition of 
light, temperature, etc.
would be the same.
The saturated atmosphere 
was obtained by placing the branch to be experimented on under a 
l)eaker resting in water.
To one side of the beaker a large piece of wet 
filter-i)aper was attached.
The dry atmosphere was obtained by placing 
the branch under a bell-jar standiiig over mercury.
Two tubes entered 
the jar, both connected with U tubes containing sulphuric acid.
To one 
tube an aspirator was connected, and a gallon of dry air [>assed through 
tlie apparatus during the experiment.

Quantity of water taken up by leaves when immersed in it.
The 
mean of several experiments gave, when the leaves were immersed for an 
hour and a half, (15) 4-37 -per cent.
— VII.
Quantity of watery vapour 
absorbed by leaves in a saturated atmosphere.
By placing branches in a

weight in the least, or (16) '0 per cent.
— VIII.
Differences in the amount 
of fluid transpired by the upper and under sides of leaves in the sun and 
in diffused daylight.
One or both surfaces of the leaves were covered 
with plastic collodion, which formed a strong film on the leaf, and effec- 
tually prevented the transpiration of fluids.
(17.) Amount of fluid transpired by upper surface of leaf in sun, one 
hour, 1"34 per cent.
(18.) Ditto, under surface, 12'33 per cent.
(19.) Ditto, both sides coated with collodion, 0-96 percent.

In these and the other experiments a branch of Laurel was taken, 
and fixed in a short test-tube containing a little water.
The branch was 
passed through a cork, and the whole carefully closed with melted 
paraffin.
By weighing the water in the tube, the branch and the whole 
apparatus, both before and after the experiment, the loss in the tube, the 
gain of the branch, and the amount transpired, could be determined.

aftbrded data for measuring the rapidity of ascent of fluid in plants.
Tlie branch was placed in a test-tube, with a small (juantity of solution of 
lithium citrate.
The branch was then placed in the sun for a certain 
time, and when removed was cut in pieces, each piece consisting of an in- 
ternode, petiole and leaf.
These were measured, nunilicred, and care- 
fully dried in the water oven.
When dry, each portion was tested by 
means of the spectroscope for lithium.

London : Robert Hardwicke.
This new edition of a well-known little book, contains a very compen- 
dious and generally accurate account of all the terms used by descriptive 
botanists, and of a good many {e.fj.
lycotropal) that are not used.
As a 
classified glossary of existing and p;irtly obsolete botanical language, it 
will be found quite as usefid as more pretentious books.
The earlier sec- 
tions contain an account of plant-chemistry, expressed with modern for- 
mula3, and a sufficient explanation of physiological terms.
Unfortunately 
terminology is not knowledge, and the educational value of this book in 
teaching anything about plants themselves, seems but small.
What are 
wanted to start science in schools are, cheap but accurate expositions of 
facts, like Huxley's 'Elementary Lessons in Physiology,' not mere collec- 
tions of dry-bones.
Mr. Cooke has not been very happy in his etymologies, though some of 
the worst of the previous edition have been suppressed.
" A Phjtozoa" 
with its plural " phjtozoce'" (p.
97), are likely to bring scorn upon his 
labours from public schoolboys, on the priuci|)le of a ploughman's contempt 
for those who cannot plongh.
As an interesting episode, the account of the fertilization of a British 
plant (pp.
71, 72) may be quoted: — "The Rosebay Willow-herb, EpUo- 
biiim angastifoUiim, has a 4-lobed stigtna, supported on a style rather 
longer than the lilaments of the stamens.
When the flower first opens, 
the lobes are closely applied together by their faces, and both style and

stamens are peiiclulous.
As the antliers approach maturity, the style be- 
comes erect, and tlie stamens commence elevating themselves.
By the 
time that the anthers are fully matured, the lobes of the stigma have di- 
vided and curled outwards and downwards in a circinate manner, so that 
they may be reached by the anthers, the filaments then become erect, 
ami the pollen is discharged upon the lobes of the stigma.
After dis- 
charging the contents of their anthers, the stamens droop and become 
])endulous again, whilst the style remains erect."

Second Edition.
Williams and Norgate : 1870.
At page 378 of the first volume of this Journal, the first edition of 
this work was noticed, at some length ; and it only remains for us to 
refer briefly to the second edition, which is now before us.
It contains 
further evidences of the care and zeal with which Dr. Prior has followed 
out the study of an important sul)ject ; and also much interesting matter 
which was not in the earlier volume.
Certain trifling errors are corrected, 
and the accounts of some of the names arc condensed from the previous 
edition ; but tiie l)0(ly of the work remains the same.
Although only 
published in 1863, it has been for some time impossible to obtain copies 
of the first edition ; and we have little doubt that the interest which has 
been awakened, mainly by Dr. Prior's researches, in plant-names, will 
induce many to purchase what must be regarded as the standard work 
upon the subject of which it treats.
We notice that the list of " works referred to " is much extended, and 
that some names, such as " Tentwort," which were left unexplained in 
SJ' PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
the first edilioii, are here traced to their origins.
Some, however, sucli 
as " Paigle," yet remain to puzzle inquirers, as none of tlie explanations 
proposed can be considered satisfactory.
A new derivation of " Cowslip" 
is given.
A most important addition is the list at the end of the volume, 
in which all the English names are brought together under their respective 
Latin equivalents ; in this way the Avant of a Latin index, which was felt 
in the first edition, is in a measure supplied.
We note at p.
24^7 the 
statement that Elodea canadensis " has hitherto been generally known as 
Babington's curse.' " Is this foolish and misleading name in actual use?
Parkinson applies the name " Jone Silver-pin " to Papaver sonmiferum, not 
to P.
Rhceaa, as stated by Dr. Prior.
We do not know why the names 
Crowfoot, Buttercup, Goldcup, etc., are, in the " systematic" list, given 
only as equivalents of Ranunculus acris, in the body of the work they are 
more correctly given for Rannnculiis ; three species, at least, being gene- 
rally so known.
W^e should have been glad to have seen more local names 
in this edition, and we miss some of the more specially philological notes 
of the former one ; but it would be ungracious to complain of a book 
which is simply invaluable to those who make any study of plant-names, 
and which cannot fail to interest any intelligent reader with philological 
or botanical predilections.

November 17^//,^1870.— J.
D. Hooker, C.i3., F.R.S., Vice-President, in 
the chair.
The only botanical paper was an elaborate " Memoir on 
Fasslflorai" by Dr. Maxwell T.
Masters, F.R.S., of which the author 
gave a general verbal summary, copiously illustrated by specimens and 
drawings.
The memoir contains a full investigation of the morphology, 
biology, and systematic position of the Order, and of its generic and spe- 
cific types.
Eirst, he spoke upon the morphology of the organs, dwelling 
on the nature of the tendrils, which here are aboitive flower-branches, and 
the mode of development of the leaves and parts of the flower.
The 
flower-tube, he maintained, was distinctly axial, and developed later thau 
the other parts of the flower.
The two sets of floral envelopes, though 
they fall together, he regarded as distinct in their nature, the outer a 
calyx of the ordinary quincuncinl type, the inner a corona, of which the 
parts are produced simultinieously.
With regard to the carpels, he criti- 
cized not only the theories but the alleged" facts brought forward by 
Schleiden : Dr. Masters considered them as unmistakably appendicular.
Next, he explained in detail the way in which in Passijlora and Tacsonia 
cross-fertilization is eftccted.
Li the fully-expanded flower, even when it 
is pendulous, the versatile stamens become extrorse through the harden- 
ing and curving of an ehistic process at the top of the fdameut, and bees

penctrntc the flower and creep amoiigst the coronal fringes, upon which 
the pollen falls, to reach a process placed down deep in the tube which 
secretes nectar copiously.
Eelying upon the hypogynous insertion of the 
stamens in the typical geuen, he inclines to place the Order in the vici- 
nity of SaiuT/dace^ and Violacere, and to regard Modecca and Papa>/acere 
as an intermediate link connecting it with CitcurbitacecB.
In treating the 
geographical distribution of the Order, he drew attention to the way in 
Avhicli the true Passion-flowers are concentrated in Brazil, with types 
mostly distinct in other parts of tropical America, and the remarkabh; 
way in which the single annual Granadilla, which the Jesuits named, and 
to which the legendary interest is attached, runs out some 20° to the 
north of the others, and yet can only be known from a common, variable 
Brazilian type by habit and duration.
Tacsonia, as he restricts it, is 
confined to the west of the Andes, and, though it climbs in its native 
localities to great heights, seems always to need conservatory-heat in our 
gardens.
There are a few true Passion-flowers in India, a small distinct 
group in Australia and Polynesia, and a single outlying species in Mada- 
gascar.
In tropical Africa there are several curious, well-marked, small 
genera.
It is now very ditficult to trace to their original homes several 
of the generally cultivated types, such as P.
quadrangular is.
which have 
established themselves in widely-distant countries.
The memoir enume- 
rates and classifies all the known genera and species of the Order, but 
describes only the few species which the author has not already treated 
recently in his two monographs, still unprinted, in the ' Flora Brasiliensis ' 
of Von IMartius and Endlicher, and in the second volume of Oliver's ' Flora 
of Tropical Africa.'

— Sir Walter 
Elliot, President, in the chair.
The President delivered an opening- 
address.
In noticing the progress of botanical investigation during the 
year, he referred to the recent discoveries of the laws governing the ferti- 
lization of plants in the two great divisions of the vegetable kingdom.
The observations of Darwin on the influence of the unequal lengths of 
stamens, and the agency of insects for the prevention of interbreeding 
among some kinds of flowering plants, have been followed by the discovery, 
in others, of the effects produced by the alternate arrival at maturitv of 
the stamens and pistils, — thus necessitating the conveyance of the pollen 
from one individual to a ditt'erent one, and so checking too close and inti- 
mate fertilization, in the non-flowering division lie referred to the investi- 
gations still zealously prosecuted, by means of the microscope, into the 
obscure subject of the fertilization of cryptogamous plants, and traced the 
progress of the recent discussions on the germ theory and the question of 
s)iontaneous generation.
He then noticed the interest that has been taken 
in the examination of.
the ])roperties of Fungi, and the exertions of the 
Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club to discriminate between the poisonous 
and innocuous species, and noted the recently-published papers of Dr.
Bull, of Hereford, Mr. Worthington Smith, Mr. Cooke, and others, on 
the subject.
Amongst recently-published works on the general science, 
particular reference was made to the full and clear definition of characttrs 
in Dr. Hooker's ' Student's Flora of the British Islands,' and to the 
ample details of recent discoveries in the new edition of Part I.

present day.
After a short reference to Mr. Carruthers' rcsearclies into 
palaeontolon'ical botany, the President gave an account of an attempt he 
had made to ascertain how far home botany had been promoted and ex- 
tended by means of local scientific societies and field clubs.
These have 
been found to be so numerous, and their researches to have been prose- 
cuted with so much success, that he liad been forcibly led to consider 
whether some means could not be devised for bringiiifj; about a more com- 
bined system of action, by which their Inljour might l)e economized and 
their discoveries made accessible to naturalists generally.
Tiiis appeared 
the more feasible, as a tendency towards the same direction had been 
evinced in several quarters, some societies having already amalgamated, 
others having agreed to publish joint Transactions ; and the idea of ad- 
vancing sucii union having occurred independently without previous con- 
cert, in otlier quarters.
The oldest local societies, none of which date 
before 1781, were shortly mentioned; and a sketch was given of the con- 
stitution and working of field clubs, the first of which came into existence 
in 1831.
Now almost every county, and even division of the same county, 
has its own association for field investigation.
A remarkable feature pre- 
sented by these inquiries was the growing interest shown to be taken by 
artisans in natural history and scientific pursuits, several societies and 
field clubs having been formed by mechanics and tradesmen entirely 
among themselves, particularly in Lancashire and the metropolis.
As a 
means of bringing about the union above adverted to, it was suggested 
that copies of the adtlress should be circulated to the different societies 
which have so courteously and readily responded to the requests for infor- 
mation ; with an invitation, should they concur in the views set forth, to 
take into consideration the means of comlnning their operations vvith 
kindred associations, so as to secure the greater amount of common good.

The first noticed was to Callander and Ben Lcdi on 16th July.

On 22nd

On 4th August a more 
extended excursion took place to Killin and the Breadalbane Mountains.
On 5th August they visited Craig Chailleach.
Here Sagina nivalis was 
collected, and Dr. Balfour remarked that this was a new station for the 
plant.
He had gathered it first on Ben Lawers in 1847, and again, in 
18fi3, on Benean, one of the tops of Benmore.
On 6th August the 
party visited Corrach Uachdar, about eight miles up Glen Lochy.
On 
this hill Cystopteris montana used to grow abundantly, but this year not

Observations were made also on protandrous plants, such as Di/jUalis,

On 9th August the party visited Larig-au-Luchan, Ben Lassie, and Ben 
Lawers, asceiuling the latter by the western side.
On the rocks at the 
former place they expected to have gathered JFoodda hyperhorea, where 
it used to occur in considerable quantity ; they were unable, liowever, to 
detect it.
On Wednesday, 10th August, they proceeded to Cheeri, a 
farmhouse about six miles up Glen Lochy, at the foot of i\lael Ghyrdy, a 
mountain over 3400 feet, which was ascended to the summit and de- 
scended on tlie opposite side for a considerable distance, to examine the 
rocks facing Glen Lyon.
On these rocks were collected Cysloptcris mon- 
tana and Bartsla alpina, which were met with in great abundance, be- 
sides many other commoner alpine plants.
The adventures of tliis 
week's excursion led to the formation, at Killin, of a Scottish Naturalists' 
Alpine Club, to consist of naturalists who are in the habit of visiting- 
alpine districts of Scotland for the study of science, and who have proved 
themselves to be pleasant compagnous de voyage.

Jlorum of VValdst.
and Kit. at Different Seasons." By Professor Balfour.
This plant, described in the Society's 'Transactions,' vol.
x. pp.
316- 
317, has been found by Mr. Sadler to present peculiar forms at different 
periods of the year.
These forms are so remarkable that they appear to 
be worthy of record.
They are not only important in themselves, but 
they are valuable as intlicating the necessity of caution in determining 
species of Hierucium by an examination of the plant at one season only.
By so doing we may be led into difficulties, and may even describe as 
distinct species what are mere variations in the growth of the same plant.
In the- month of June we have tvvo forms of the plant.
In No. 1 there 
is a thickish root giving oft" slender rootlets chiefly on one side, the crown 
of the root producing a few leaves (3-5) which are obovate-spathulate ; 
from the crown also arises a very hairy, short, floral axis, about an inch 
long, which bifurcates, each branch elongating and bearing a few narrow 
leaves which diminish in size as we ascend.
The branches sometimes 
terminate at the end in two smaller axes, each bearing a very small and 
contracted head of flowers.
At other times the ascending axis divides in 
a dichotomous manner once or twice before produchig capitula.
The 
whole habit of the plant is peculiar on account of the small number of 
leaves, and the very much elongated floral axis — sometimes being 12-14 
inches in length, and the small capitula.
It looks starved, and may per- 
haps be the form called hifurcuvi by Frolich, or the collino-F domlla of 
Fries, Novitia?, or the coUiuiim of his Monograph on Hieraclum, p.
9. 
In the other June form (No. 2) we meet with the long slender scapes, 
the small capitula, and the marked bifurcation, as in form No. 1 ; but 
there are produced numerous stolons, bearing many obovate-spathulate 
leaves.
In this there are often several (two or more) primary scapes 
arising from the crown of the root.
In this case we have an approach to 
the Filusella form.
This may be the //.
pedimculutam of Wallroth, de- 
scribed as a singular prostrate plant.
In the end of July and beginning 
of August we have form No. 3, in which the stolons have multi])lied

largely, and most of them end in corymbose clusters of capitula, wliicli 
are raucli larger than in the first two forms.
In this case there are no 
elongated, naked, or few-flowered scapes, but stolons bearing heads of 
flowers.
Tlie rhizome is creeping and stoloniferous, and the leaves are 
obovate-obtuse.
Some of the stolons, however, do not flower at tliis 
stage, but strike root at their extremities, and form independent plants, a 
few of which flower in October and Noveml)er, forming No. 4 ; others do 
not flower till the succeeding June, Nos. 1 and 2.
This is a near 
approach to the //.
stolonijlomm of Fries, in his Monograph of Hiera- 
cium, and it may be the Jlaf/iUiirc of Willdenow.
In the month of 
October, we meet with form No. 4.
In this we have the condition de- 
scribed in the ' Transactions,' or the stolonijlornm of Fries.
Here we 
have a cluster of obovate-obtuse leaves at the base, with a single scape 
often monopihyllous, rising directly upwards, and bearing few heads, gene- 
rally two, of a larger size than those of the otlier forms mentioned ; and 
from tiie crown of the root proceed several young stolons, bearing nume- 
rous leaves, but no flowers.
These stolons are those which flower the 
ibllowing year, as seen in No. 3.
Mr. Sadler made some remarks on 
specimens of a form of Centaurea nigra, which he collected in September 
last on the Achil Hills, near Forgandenny, in Perthshire.
It is the C.
pratemis of French authors.
A note was read from Mr. I.
F. Duthie, 
regarding two forms of Pi/rus in Arran.
Dr. Boswell Syme considers 
thera both as P.
scandica, the one with the lower pinnpe separated being 
P. scandica, var.
pi)matifida.
Mr. Duthie stated that he tasted the 
fruit of the Arran P.
pinnatifida, and found it quite sweet ; whereas, ac- 
cording to Fries, the fruit of P.fennica is acid.
Professor Dickson exhi- 
bited a plant of the Chinese Primrose having stamens and style of the 
same length (short), although in this species, as in the other dimorphic 
Primroses, they are usually of different lengths.
This form is interesting, 
inasmuch as in an abnormal Cowslip, described some years ago by Mr.
John Scott, the stamens and style, although of the same length, were 
both long.

latus in large quantity on the banks of the Tny, near Seggieden, Perth-

— Nov.
1th, 1S70.
— J.
Baxendidl, Esq., in the chair; " On the Hawthorns of the 
Manchester Flora," by C.
Bailey.
Characters were given of the three 
segregates of C.
Oxyacantha, L., found in Great Britain.
— The prevailing 
form in the district is the C.
monogynn, Jacq.
; it is that of which all the 
quickset hedges are made, and is said to flower a fortnight later than the 
third subspecies.
The second form, the C.
kyriostyla of Fingerhuth, I 
collected on the 25th May, 1867, in Botany Bay Wood (Mersey Province, 
County No. 59 of Watson), on the path from Barton Moss to Worsley, 
where it forms several handsome trees.
It attracted my attention at once 
by the large proportion of its flowers which possessed two styles, and Ijy 
the comparative large size of the corymbs ; its fruit 1 have not been able 
to examine, as the ground in which it occurs is preserved by the Earl of 
Ellesmere, and is accessible only by a written order.
The addition of the 
third subspecies, G.
oxyncanthoides, Thuill., to our flora, is due to Mr.
John Hardy, who detected a single bush of it on the 27th August last, at 
Marple (Mersey Province, County No. 58), on the right-hand side of the

high-road from the railway station, a little past the uppermost lock of the 
canal.
The leaves of this plant are of considerable size, being about twice 
as large as those of a plant in my herbarium from Rampstead, collected 
by Dr. J, Boswell Syme, and excepting that the leaves are glabrous, the 
Marple plant appears to agree with the variety /3 majns, Hobkirk.
The 
most obvious character for determining this subspecies in the absence of 
the flower or fruit, is the arrangement of nerves in the leaves, which are 
arcuate, with the extremities.
turned towards the midrib; in the two flrst- 
named forms the nerves are arcuate in the opposite direction, i.
e. they are 
turned outwards.
There is -one peculiarity in the venation of the Haw- 
thorns, which is invariably overlooked by the draughtsman and engraver, 
viz.
the direction of the secondary nerves, which proceed from the midrib 
to the base of each sinus ; such an arrangement is very rare, being found 
only in some other species of Crut<e(jus, as C.
Azarolns, etc., in species of 
Fa(jus, and in a few other plants.
Mr. Spencer H.
Bickhant, jun., reported 
the occurrence of Myosiirus minimus, L., in plenty at Yale Royal, near 
Northwich, which species he believed had never previously been noticed 
in the neighbourhood.

" Notes on the Botany of Mere, Cheshire," by George E.
Hunt.
The border of Mere Mere has for long been a locality famous to the bota- 
nists round Manchester, and T was led, in 1864, to commence a systematic 
and continuous exploration of Mere, with the view of discovering as many 
of the recorded Mosses as might still exist there.
It may be of service to 
other bryologists in the district to mention those which grow there at the 
present date, and also the nature of soil they prefer.
Phr/scumitrium 
sphm-icum, found by Wilson in 1834, and recorded in the Bry. Brit.
A 
careful search, in 1864, led to the re-discovery of this species in very 
minute quantity.
In 1865 it was still more sparing (not above a dozen 
capsules).
1866 was so exceedingly wet a season that the plant could 
not have come up at all.
1867, it again occurred very sparingly.
18G8, 
it was plentiful, but destroyed by the autumn rains before much of tlie 
fruit had ripened.
1869, again frequent, and would have been plentiful 
but the autumn rains again destroyed it whilst the fruit was even more 
immature than in the preceding year.
1870, very plentiful, and abun- 
dance of it has come to maturity.
This Moss always grows on dried mud.
Phascum serratum ^ is frequent every autumn on clay and sandy banks at 
Mere ; it occurs quite frequently in cornfields at Bowdon, in damp sea- 
sons, coming up a few weeks after the corn has been cut.
In cornfields 
at Bowdon its companions are P.
muticum, P.
alter nifoUum, and Pottla 
iruncata, and very rarely Trichodon cylmdricns — the latter never fruits in 
this district.
Phascum nitidum, frequent every autumn at Mere on clay 
and sandy banks ; it occurs elsewhere about Bowdon on newly-cut ditph 
banks.
P. rostellatiim, on banks at Mere, with the two previous species, 
but much more sparingly.
It has also been found in Sussex by Mr.
Mitten, and was collected there again last year by Mr. Davies.
It is one 
of the rarest of all the British Mosses.
P. sessile, very rare at Mere.
I 
collected it in the autumn of 18G9, and again in November, 1870, inter- 
mixed very sparingly among P.
serratum, from which it is difficult to 
separate it except with the aid of the microscope.
With this it can be at 
once distinguished from tliat si)ecies by its longer, more rigid, almost en- 
tire leaves, with a very wide nerve.
P. serratum has no nerve, and the 
30 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIEllES.
loaves are spinulosely serrated.
P. sessile was gathered in Sussex many 
years since, but I liave not heard of its recent discovery either tliere or 
elsewhere.
It is one of the rarest British Mosses.
P. patens, on dried 
mud, almost every season, intermixed with Physcomitrium splicericum, and 
usually much more plentiful than that species.
This Moss comes up in 
autumn in the Ashley district of Bowdon, although very sparingly, 
wherever an open drain has been cut in spring.
It also springs up about 
BoUington, under the same circumstances.
Phascum ciispiilatnm.
I have 
not yet found this at Mere, but it comes up on banks on the Chester lload 
between Bowdon and Bucklow Hill, when they have been newly made up, 
or plastered with mud from the road.
Leskia polycarpa fruits freely about 
the roots of trees on the borders of Mere, both in autumn and spring.
Hypnum ripariiim, a very neat variety of this Moss, fruits in abundance 
in August and April, on clay banks and at the roots of trees at Mere.
Eiccia Jhdtans and R.
crystallina are both frequent on dried mud at Mere, 
with Phascum patens, etc., and both species fruit freely there.
Numerous 
interesting flowering plants are also found, viz.
Elatlne hexandra, Limosella 
aquatica, Pepl'is Portala, Polyrjonnm minus, Littorella lacnstris, — all plen- 
tiful on mud.
Carex vesicaria, fringing the woods at the edge of the Mere.
Scirpiis acicularis, in vast quantity in sandy places.
Car.ex (Ederi, in stony 
and grassy places.
This is the true (Ederi, and very rare ; I have only- 
seen it elsewhere on the sands on the south side of Southport, where it is 
very abundant and luxuriant.
It appears quite distinct as a species 
from C.jlava (including C.
lepidocarpa), with which it is often placed as 
a variety.
Centunculus minimus, frequent some seasons in the open pas- 
tures on the borders of the Mere.
Menlha sativa, in ditches by the road- 
sides between Bucklow Hill and Mere Mere.
Rubus Balfoiirianus and R.
pallidns, in thickets by the Mere.
Polygonum, mite has been reported 
from Mere, but after searching without success for it for several seasons, 
I can only suppose that some of the more luxuriant forms of P.
minus, 
frequent there, have been mistaken for it.
The seeds of P.
minus, which 
are shining black, and only half the size of those of P.
mite, afford the 
only safe distinction.
— Mr. Hardy remarked that so long ago as 1828, 
Mr. AVilliam Wilson, of Warrington, sent P.
mite from a Cheshire locality, 
under the erroneous name of P.
minus, to the late Sir William Jackson 
Hooker, in whose herbarium at Kew the specimens still are.
Mr. Hewett 
C. Watson, the author of the ' Cybele Britannica,' mentions these speci- 
mens, and does not express any doubt of their being the P.
mite, of 
Schrank.
Mr. Hardy found the plant at Mere in 1860, and sent speci- 
mens to the Botanical Exchange Club, then located at Thirsk ; and Mr.
J. G.
Baker, the Curator, in his rej^ort for the next year, mentions these 
specimens as new to the Mersey province, Mr. Hardy stated his belief in 
Mr. Watson's opinion, that P.
mite was much more difficult to distinguish 
from P.
Persicaria than from P.
minus ; and he had not the least doubt, 
notwithstanding Mr. Hunt's objection, that, now special attention had 
been called to the species in question, it would be proved, in the course of 
another season, to be an inhabitant not only of the Mere district, but 
common in other stations included in the Manchester flora.

After tlie long" service of forty-two years, Mr. J.
J. Bennett has resio-ned 
the keepership of the botanical collections at the British Museum.
When, 
in 1828, Mr. Bennett became Mr. Robert Brown's assistant, the her- 
barium of Sir J.
Banks had only just become national property, and Mr.
Brown had been appointed -its tirst keeper.
Till the death of the latter, 
in 18.58, Mr. Bennett worked laboriously at the naming and arrangement 
of the constantly increasing national collection.
For the last eleven years, 
as head of the botanical department, Mr. Bennett's uniform courtesy and 
kindness, and the readiness with which he has always placed his great 
stores of information at the disposal of all who applied to him have been 
conspicuous and fully appreciated.
How varied and extensive that know- 
ledge is, is known to too few, though the exhaustive notes of the ' Plantte 
Javanicse Eariores ' are some published evidence.
It is with great regret 
that we chronicle a loss to the Museum which can scarcely be replaced, 
but we trust that freedom from official cares and duties may long preserve 
among us one who is esteemed by all wlio know him.
The Perthshire Society of Natural Science have in contemplation the 
establishment of a Cjuarterly magazine, the proposed title of which is ' The 
Scottish Naturalist and Journal of the Perthshire Society of Natural 
Science,' to be specially devoted to the record of observations and dis- 
coveries made in the North.
As the subscription is only 3s.
4t?.
annually 
(including postage), we hope that many will send their names to Mr. A.
T. Scott, Clydesdale Bank, Perth, the Hon. Secretary.
The first number 
will appear this January.
The first volume of the ' Transactions of the Newbury District Field 
Club ' is in prepar;ition, and will appear about March next.
It will con- 
tain a list of Berkshire plants by Mr. Britten.
We hear that the directorship of the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, vacant 
since the lamented death of Dr. T.
Anderson, is likely to be filled by the 
appointment of Dr. King.
Among some MSS.
of Pulteney's, lately acquired by the Linnean 
Society, is a Flora (pp.
121) of the neighbourhood of Loughborough, 
Leicestershire.
It has the date 1719, and must have been one of Pulteney's 
earliest efforts.
It contains a good many coloured drawings of Lichens 
and Fungi.
A list of the rare plants found in this neighbourhood w^as 
afterwards contributed by Pulteney to Nichols's ' History of Leicester- 
shire' (1790).
Mr. H.
C. Watson has published a complete list, with critical notes of 
the Phanerogams and Ferns of the Azorean Isles, in Mr. Godmau's 
' Natural History of the Azores.' We shall notice at length this interest- 
ing catalogue in our next number.
We are glad to hear that the authorities of the Post-Office have under 
consideration a revision of the rules at present in force with reference 
to the sample and pattern post.
The recent regulations restricting the 
articles which may be sent by this method to bond-fide trade samples 
have proved very vexatious to botanists, as well indeed as to all classes

of the community, and considerable public dissatisfaction has been ex- 
pressed.
There is, however, a good chance of a restitution of the old 
arrangements, if not the adoption of some of even greater convenience.
Messrs.
Berkeley and Broome contiiuie in the last number of the 
' Annals of Natural History,' their notices of British Fungi.
Eighty 
species are enumerated (all species of ArjarlcHs), most of which are re- 
cent additions to the British flora, and several of wdiich were first 
published in this Journal.
There appear to be seven species new to 
science described, viz.
A. (Lepiota) netultespora, A.
(Lepiola) Fetreii, 
A. (Mycena) sacchariferus, A.
(Naucosia) semiflcxus, A.
(HypholcEua) Icu- 
cotephrm, A.
(Psilocybe) aquar'ms, A.
(Psathyrella) empyreumaticus.
Our readers will not fail to observe the alteration in the aspect of our 
pages.
By the adoption of a ' solid ' motle of printing, and by lessening 
the margin, a gain in the amount of letterpress equal to more than eleven 
of our old pages has been eftected in each number without altering the 
size of the page or increasing the bulk of the Journal.
We have been 
encouraged to make these changes by the increase in the amount of 
material which comes into our hands ; and, in the hope that our circula- 
tion will equally extend itself, no increase has been made in the subscrip- 
tion.
In return for these advantages, and in consideration of the addi- 
tional expenses of a greatly-enlarged magazine, we hope our correspon- 
dents will co-operate with us, and we earnestly request them to endeavour 
to spread a knowledge of the existence of this Journal amongst their 
botanical friends.
An impression has been prevalent among purely British botanists that 
their special department is neglected in our pages.
A perusal of the 
volume just completed will show how unfounded is this notion.
While 
it has been, and still is, our object to exclude no department of botanical 
science, it is desired to give especial attention to our own flora ; and no 
communication which adds any fact, however slight,- to existing know- 
ledge of British plants is refused.
We invite, therefore, that section of 
our subscribers on which w^e chiefly depend for support to contribute to 
our pages.
With the exception of detailed descriptions of botanical 
excursions in well-known districts, there is scarcely any subject bearing 
on the vegetation of Great Britain and Ireland which will not be most 
acceptable.

Original g^rticlcs.
ON POLYGONUM NODOSUM.
By W.
T. Thiselton Dyer, B.A., B.Sc , 
Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
The two species o^ Polygonum, P.
Perfticaria, L., and P.
lap nthi folium, L., 
are coiispiciioiisly represented in the late summer vegetation of broken 
and uncared-for land about London, -by several easily recogin'zed forms.
Like the Chenopodiums and Atriplexes that grow with them, they flourish 
on ground which has been liberally cultivated till laid out for building, 
but which has not yet become hard and consolidated l)y the alternate 
action of rain-wash and sun-baking.
There are always plenty of spots in 
the advancing outskirts of the suburbs where these conditions are to b< 
found, and it is seldom necessary to look far for a place to study Poly' 
(/OHinns.
Quite the commonest of the London forms, though perhaps not else- 
where so frequent, are those which are described in English books under 
the names of P.
nodosum or P.
laxum.
(See Fl. Middlesex, pp.
243, 244.) 
They are not perhaps collectively separable from typical P.
lupaihi folium, 
by very satisfactory characters, yet they belong to a type which has been 
well figured by Curtis, Reichenbach, and Babington, and is thoroughly 
familiar to Metropolitan botanists, — having a certain characteristic fades 
which serves the ends of recognition, as well perhaps as anything more 
definite.
Typical P.
lapatlii folium has a somewhat ditiuse mode of 
growth, and dense cylindrical and remote racemes, with perianths and 
unspotted stems of a dull apple-green colour.
The P.
nodosum, of authors, 
on the other hand, is rather erect than diffuse, and has stems usually 
spotted ; racemes collected into a more or less distinct pyramidal panicle, 
laxer, and narrower in proportion to their length ; the perianths also are 
reddish and smaller, and the fruit is, roughly speaking, half the size of that 
of P.
lapathifoUum. It was well known to the ante-Linnsean botanists; 
the Persicaria latifolia geuiculata caulibns maculatis, D.
Rand., which was 
found "passim circa Londinum " (Bay, Syn. iii.
14.5), belongs to it; and 
two forms were distinguished by Buddie, and are preserved in his herbarium 
(Herb.
Sloane, vol.
cxvii.
fol.
20).
It was described and figured by Curtis 
under the name of P.
Pensylvanicum var.
caule maculato (Flor.
Lond.
f. 1), 
by Reichenbach as P.
nodosum, Pers.
(Iconog.
Bot. Cent.
V. ic.
689), and 
finally by Babington as P.
laxum,^e\c\\.
(E.
B. S.
28 22).
In each case 
it seems extremely probable that the plant has been wrongly identified.
Curtis probably followed Hudson in referring these glandular Polygonums 
to P.
Pensylvanicum,, L., with which, however, they have little coiuiection.
It is less easy to decide its claims to be considered the P.
nodosum of 
Persoon.
As, however, the description given by that author of his plant 
is very short, the whole may be quoted for comparison : — 
* Nodosum, caule elongato maculato ad geuiculas nodoso, vaginis nudis, 
fol.

It is marked with an asterisk, which indicates its being looked upon as 
an obscure plant.
Taking into consideration Persoon's inclination* to 
include it under P.
Persicaria, it seems reasonable to conclude that it was 
not glandular, and if so, the naked stipules are the only character which 
leans towards an identification Avith P.
lapatJdfuUum, and that is by no 
means an absolute one.
In all other respects the description agrees 
better with a large state of Greuier and Godron's variety elatmn of P.
Pemicaria, especially as a preference for damp situations is indicated.
This is the view adopted by Syme (Eng. Bot.
vol.
viii.
p. 75) ; Meisner, 
in DC.
Prod.
vol.
xiv.
p. 118, also places it in the section t with non- 
glandular peduncles, with P.
Persicaria, and away from P.
lapafhifolium.
The P.
laxiim of Reichenbach is described and figured by liiin (Icouog.
Bot. ic.
68.5, Cent.
V. p.
36) as a non-glaadular plant, with the stipules 
veiy slightly cdiated, but the peduncles and pedicels strigose-hispid.
The 
styles are shown in the figure to be connected halfway up as in P.
Per- 
sicaria, and not as in P.
lapathifoUnm, nearly free.
Bearing in mind 
Syme's remark that P.
nodusnui, auct., has very much the aspect of the 
var.
elatmn of P.
Persicaria, it will probably be admitted that, as between 
the two plants, the arrangement of the styles aiul die absence of glands 
carry P.
laxmn, Reich., rather towards P.
Persicaria than towards P.
lapathifolium.
Since, then, the descriptions neither of P.
nodosum, Pers., nor of P.
laxicm, Reich., clearly characterize the P.
nodosum of authors, we are forced, 
if we regard it as of specific or sub-specific rank, to search for another 
name ; and though by no means satisfactory, Gray's Persicaria maculata 
appears to be the earliest post-Linnfean one unquestionably applying to the 
plant.
J 
Reichenbach, in his description of this plant (^, c), speaks of it as 
" vario modo confusa atque cum aliis concussa." And if additional illus- 
tration of this remark were needed, it could be supplied in abundance 
from English books.
Babington, in the first four editions of his ' Manual,' 
quotes Reichenbach's P.
nodosum as a variety of P.
lapathifolium, quite 
connected by intermediate forms.
As he named the plant which he 
described and figured in E.
B. S.
2822 (clearly identical with Reichen- 
bach's nodosuni), laxum, Reich., he was compelled, contrary to the fact, to 
represent Reichenbach's laxum as a glandular plant with an aiTangeraent 
of styles resembling that of P.
lapathifolium rather than P.
Persicaria.
In the fifth edition "P.
nodosum, Pers.," disappears as a variety of P.
lapathifolium, to take the place of " P.
laxmn, R.," which is reduced to a 
synonym of it.
Yet there is no reference to Reichenbach's characteristic 
figure of " P.
nodosum^'' but his figure of P.
laxum, which contradicts the 
description, is quoted instead.
The same arrangement is maintained in 
the sixth edition.
Bentham looks upon P.
lapathifolium as probably a 
mere variety of P.
Persicaria, only distinguished by the "pedicels and 
perianths being dotted with small prominent glands." This might very

ii.
p. 25), " Pers.
a lapathifolio separans, P.

subjnngere vellet." 
t Pedunculi eglandulosi, laeres, glabri vel pubescentes.
J In the Kew Herbarium are examples with the name P.
paniculatum, Andr., 
on the authority of Besser.
This good descriptive name, looking at tlie arrange- 
ment of the inflorescence, seems never to have been published, and has besides 
been appropriated to a Java species bj Blame.

35 
well be the case if the fig, 868, in the illustrated edition of the 'Hand- 
book of the British Flora' be accepted as characteristic of P.
Persicaria.
It has, however, all the habit of P.
maculatum, and the stifles are repre- 
sented unconnected and deflexed as in P.
lapathi folium.
About London P.
Persicaria, L., presents itself in the typical form, well 
figured in a new plate by Syme in E.
B. MCCXXXVIL, and by Reichen- 
bach (Iconog.
Bot. ic.
684).
This lias a stem rarely spotted, with 
rather loosely arranged divaricating branches and stout, rather short (com- 
pared with P.
maculatum), blunt, oblong or cyliiulrical, remote racemes.
The plant figured by Curtis (Flor.
Lond.
f. 1) is prol)ably a luxuriant state 
of the type.
The old figure of P.
Persicaria, E.
B. 756, now used by Syme 
to illustrate the variety tlatnm, is one from which all definite characters 
seem to have evaporated, and is almost valueless.
The authentic speci- 
mens of P.
Persicaria in Sowerby's herbarium are really P.
maculatum , 
and it is by no means impossible that this plant was in part copied by the 
artist, though the details are from P.
Persicaria.
A much rarer form of this species occurs occasionally in moist culti- 
vated ground.
It may be distinguished from the type by its more succu- 
lent and swollen stem, ascending and not divaricate branches, and racemes 
not cylindrical, but longer and attenuated upwards, contracted when young 
into a panicle.
The foliage also is somewhat weaker in texture, and of a 
livelier green.
This is the P.
biforme of Wahlenberg (Suec.
n. 437) and 
of Fries (Mant.
ii.
p. 28), who quotes Curtis's figure, in which he is per- 
haps right,* and also Reichenbach's, which belongs to the more typical 
form.
Authentic specimens of P.
biforme, from Fries, in the Kew Her- 
barium, it is noticeable have ochrese without cilia, though this does not ac- 
cord with the description.
P. Persicaria, (3.
elatum (Gren.
et Godr.
Fl. de 
Fr. vol.
iii.
p. 48), is another synonym, and it has already been shown to 
be probably the true P.
nodosum, of Persoon.
P. laxum, Reich., which 
seems to have nothing really to do with P.
maculatum., may be also cap- 
able of inclusion here.
Some writers (Boreau, Fl. du Cent, de la Fr. ed.
3, 
t. ii.
p. 557, Gren.
et Godr.
1. c.
p. 49) regard P.
laxum, Reich., as a hybrid 
between P.
Hydropiper and P.
maculatum.
If so, it is remarkable that 
a glandless plant should be the offspring of two glandular parents.
Fries 
says of this plant " transitus ad Mite,'^ (Mant.
vol.
ii.
p. 26).
f A curious 
variety referable to the typical form of P.
Persicaria, but which may be 
really a hybrid, has the peduncles slightly glandular hispid.
It has been 
distributed by Mr. Watson from Esher, and has been noticed at Kilburn 
and Haverstock Hill.
There are also specimens from Essex in E.
Forster's 
herbarium.
It will be convenient to give the characters and synonymy in a col- 
lected form.
J 
* In Fl. Midd.
p. 244, we have also quoted it, but our notion of this form was 
at that time more compreliensive tlian now.
t Reichenbach, in his description in tlie ' Iconographia Botanica,' was not disposed 
to accept the suggestion of hybridity, remarking " nimis enim prodigiosa mihi 
videtur hybi'iditas hodierna.'' However, in the ' Flora Excursoria,' 3696, he gives 
Hi/dropiperl-nodosum as a synonym, witli the explanation " Inflorosccntia densa 
gracilis floresqne parvi rosei P.
nodosi, folia contra et ochreoe P.
Hi/dropiperis.'^ 
J Linnceus seems to have founded his P.
lapathifolium on a species of Tournefort's, 
and the only locality he gives is " Gallia" ; as he describes the plant as " lloribus .
. .
semidigyuis," it is somewhat doubtful what he really meant.
The Liunean Herba- 
rium only confuses matters, the specimen named " lapathifoUunC^ being a widely

Typical P.
Persicaria and both subspecies of P.
lapathifoUum, equally 
admit of forms found on barren soil, more or less prostrate and depau- 
perate, which have the leaves clothed beneath with short dense white 
hairs (varieties called incanum), and the racemes often subglobose or 
ovate.
In their normal state these plants will generally be found easily 
distinguishable.
It must, however, be admitted, that while what is held 
here to be the true P.
nodosum of I'ersoon, graduates into the typical con-

dition of P.
Persicaria, it is itself on the other hand often difficult to dis- 
tinguish from subeglaiiduhir states of P.
maculatum.
Such a difficulty 
no botanist is unfamiliar with.
The names of critical plants in books are 
often nothing more than halting-points in a long series of connected forms, 
arbitrary perhaps, yet not without their value in marking out the route.
It seems as unphilosophical to ignore anything but the bounding terms, 
as it would be uncritical to tliink nothing of importance in a journey 
through an interesting country, but the starting-point and the destination.
^ ON THE SO-CALLED "OLIVES" {C JN ARII spi^.) OF 
SOUTHERN CHINA.
By H.
F. Hance, Ph.D., etc.
In his excellent ' Notes on Chinese Materia Medica,' Mr. D.
Hanbury 
refers to certain fruits known to foreigners resident in this country by the 
name of Chinese Olives ; and he suggests the desirableness of more precise 
information being obtained in regard to tliem.
Of those which Mr.
Hanbury mentions as sold at Foocliow and Shanghae, I have no know- 
ledge at all ; and the following observations relate exclusively to the fruit 
vended everywhere in the south of Kwang-tung province, of which there 
are two kinds, — the U-lam, or Black, and the Fak-lain or White Olive, 
— produced respectively by Canarium Pimela, Konig, and C.
album, 
Eseuschel.
On these two plants and a third Cochinchinese species, occm'ring also 
throughout the Moluccas, Loureiro founded his genus Pimela* which, bv 
the consent of all subsequent botanists, was merged in Canarium, until 
again distinguished by the late Professor Blume, who considered it a 
" genus Optimo jure diguum esse quodrestituatur.f The only characters, 
however, by which it tliffers from C.
commune and its allies consist in the 
thin foliaceous not fleshy cotyledons, and in the insertion of the stamens at 
the base instead of the margin of the disk; distinctive marks which 
Dr. Hooker very naturally regards as of merely sectional value.
J 
Both the white and black Olives are a good deal grown around Whanipoa, 
whilst I have seen none in the immediate neighbourhood of Canton, or 
in Hongkong, and their cultivation is therefore apparently local : I can 
gain no intelligence of their occurrence in a wild state.
They are trees 
from twenty to thirty feet high, with a whitish trunk, and a close round 
crown of foliage, § which in hot sunny days exhales a grateful balsamic 
odour ; in which respect, as well as in general aspect, they resemble our 
common Walnut.
The two species, though perfectly distinct, are singu- 
larly alike, — so much so, indeed, that even now, after having made them 
an object of special study, I am quite unable, in the absence of fruit, to 
tell one from the other at a few feet distance.
Blume gives the following 
differential characters : —

These are, however, neither quite accurate, nor by any means sufficient 
for the discriiuiuation of the two species ; and, in their lieu, I propose the 
following, drawn up after a careful comparative exaniinatiou of living 
specimens of each tree.

I should remark that, when dried, the leaves of both species have the 
veinlets prominent, but the network is much closer and finer in those of 
the white Olive.
As regards the mode of using these fruits, the following is the informa- 
tion I have myself gathered, from personal observation and inquiry of the 
natives : — -The white Olive is either eaten fresh, in which state its strongly 
resinous flavour renders it disagreeable to the European palate, or is 
placed, when quite ripe, in tubs filled with salt, stirred about continually, 
and, after the lapse of a day taken out and dried.
In this state it is 
hawked al)out in great abundance, and tastes much as the European Olive 
might be expected to do, if removed from the brine in which it is kept 
and allowed to dry, with an appreciable sonpqon of turpentine superadded.
I have been told it is regarded as a preventive of sea-sickness.
The 
black Olive is never eaten raw, but only after having been steeped for a 
few moments in boiling water.
Thus prepared (and packed in jars, with 
the addition of a little salt, when desired to be preserved), it is of a fine 
purplish-red colour, like well-made fresh pickled cabbage, and has some 
resemblance iti taste to freshly pickled mango, a flavour to me not un- 
pleasant, but de gnstlbtiH non est dlspulandnm .
This fruit is held in much 
higher esteem than the other, and it is usual to keep a strict watch over 
it as it ripens to prevent depredation.
I have seen a man who was found 
luxuriating in the umbrageous coma of a tree to which he could lay no 
claim, with a basket full of the fruit in his possession, tied " spread- 
eagle " fashion to the trunk for nearly a day, the monotony of his durance 
being varied by periodical flagellations.
• 
Loureiro thus tiescribcs the reputed qualities of the two Olives : 
G. album.

40 ON THE SO-CALLED " OLIVES OF SOUTHERN CHINA, 
For tlie following notice of these trees, extracted and translated from a 
description of the ' Memorabilia of Kwangtniig,' published in 1801, I am 
indebted to my friend Mr. W.
F. Mayers, H.M.'s Acting Consul for 
Clie-foo.
" The Yi'ieh Chung Kieti Wm states as follows : — Of the Lan there are 
two species, the black and the white.
Of both the tree grows high and 
perfectly straight, usually with the trunk quite devoid of branches except 
at the summit, where it throws out its crown.
There are male and female 
[trees], tiie male having flowers [only] and the feuiale fruit.
The males 
are properly called Lnug-knng (/'.
e. male or ' sir,' Cauarium), and do not 
produce fruit, but if brought in contact with the female the fruit forms.
The fruit resembles that of the Tsao (Jujube, or Chinese Date), about an 
inch or more in length, and is devoid of angles.
The earliest growth 
hangs downward, those grown later point upwards.
The fruit is ripe in 
the eighth or ninth month, when the cultivators mount the tree by means 
of ladders, and knock the fruit down with sticks.
Another Avay is to 
make an incision of about an inch [in width] in the trunk, on its east side, 
and to rub in some coarse salt, which causes the fruit on the east side to 
fall down spontaneously ; and similarly on the three remaining sides of 
the tree.
The white Lan, if not eaten until after the Pe/i Lu period (8th 
September), does not cause sickness.
Its qualities are heating.
When 
eaten, the tapering points at either end should be removed.
On first 
being chewt d, the flavour is hitter and astringent, but after a time the 
flavour develops itself and turns sweet.
The colour is white.
When 
boiled in water at a high temperature the colour changes to a pale green, 
and its fragrance becomes as that of the Lan {Epidetidruvi ?), so that it 
sweetens the breath.
Of the black Lan, the fruit is larger, and the flesh 
has greater substance.
Its qualities are mild, aiul its flavour astringent, 
wiih a slightly sweet taste.
It should be boiled in tepid water, until it 
becomes soft and the purple skin puft's out, when it is fit to eat.
If the 
water be cold, it will emit a gummy exudation ; and if too hot, the flesh 
will harden, so that it is important to use tepid water only.
In the southern 
portion of the Pwau-yli district the black Lan is largely grown, and the 
fruit, after being deprived of its stone, is cooked and preserved with 
brine as an article of merchandise, which has a sale far and near." 
The stones of some species of Canariiun are beautifully and elaborately 
carved by the Chinese ; and, when set in gold, or separated by gold 
filigree beads, form exceedingly handsome brooches or bracelets.
These 
are popularly supposed by foreigners, and even by many Chinese, to be 
cut out of peach-stones ; though a very cursory inspection will show that 
this is a fallacy.
Amoy is renowned for this kind of work, and, so highly 
is it esteemed, that some beads I purchased on the spot, to have made 
into a bracelet, cost me a dollar (4s.
'6cl.) each ; a very large sum, when 
the slight remuneration in China for skilled labour and the cost of native 
living are borne in mind.
These stones, so far as I can judge from the 
sculptured specimens, seem too large to be the produce of Canariiim 
Pimela.
They may either belong to a distinct species, or to one of those 
alluded to by Mr. Hanbiuy, respecting all of which I may, perhaps, here- 
after succeed in gaininsj; some reliable information.

ON THE FORMS AND DISTRIBUTION OVER THE WORLD 
OF THE BATRACHIUM SECTION OF RANUNCULUS.
By VV.
p. HiERN, M.A.
About seventy-five different specific names have been published for the 
plants coming under this section.
According to the views held by various 
44- FORMS AND DISTRIBUTION OF BATIIACHIUM.
botanists with reference to their specific distinctness, many of the names 
have been used in different senses and with different impressions of the 
range of forms lo be included under them.
After stiidying the phints botli in the living state and in the herbarium, 
I conclude, taking into consideration the intricate network of connecting 
links that seem to me to break down specific characters in several direc- 
tions, that the best and most philosophical course to follow is to unite all 
the forms under one aggregate species.
Nor am I alone in this opinion, 
for Spenner, in his ' Flora Friburgensis,' published in 1829, adopted such 
an arrangement and called the collective species by the name of Ranun- 
culus hydrochm-'is, describing at the same time several varieties ; this name 
I adopt.
Again, Drs. J.
D. Hooker and T.
Thomson, in the first volume of their 
'Flora Indica,' published in 1855, expressed their willingness to unite all 
the segregate species known to them into one ; and Mr. Bentham, in the 
first edition of his ' Handbook of British Botany,' did combine all the 
British forms into one species.
It is right, however, to mention that in 
his second edition of the same work, Mr. Bentham reverted to the decision 
of LinnfEus and allowed two species ; and also that Dr. Hooker, in his 
recent ' Students' Flora of the British Islands,' has recognized three 
species, namely, R.
aquatilis, R.
Lenormandi, and R.
Jiederaceus.
Such, however, are the variations and remarkable differences presented 
by many of the forms that it is desirable, and almost necessary, in order 
to understand the plants, at least for the purposes of local floras, to men- 
tion, and as far as possible define, the principal forms and give them dis- 
tinctive names.
For this purpose I have drawn up an artificial key for referring any 
given specimen to the name which most nearly applies to it ; this I have 
tried to make as practically useful as possible, but the reticular bond of 
union which prevails in nature amongst the members of this group is so 
complicated and involved as to render any such ready method impossible 
in some cases and difficult in several ; and the difficulty has been increased 
in consequence of the large number (35) of ultimate forms that have been 
included.
Concurrently with the ultimate forms, I liave cited several names of a 
comparatively collective meaning, which can be used when further deter- 
mination caimot be reached.
Thus botanists of whatever views with 
reference to specific values, will be enabled to stop at will and help them- 
selves, consistently with the nature of the case, to whatever name they 
please.
In nearly every case I have employed already published specific names 
for the forms, whether aggregate or segregate, which I recognize.
One 
new form only I have named as of co-ordinate value with the rest of my 
ultimate forms, namely, No. 3, Lobbii.
This is a native of California and 
Oregon, and is interesting as occupying a place under the hederaceiis 
group, and yet making some approach to the aquatilis group.
In a paper on this subject read before the Cambridge University Natural 
Science Society on October 25th, 1864, I attempted a geometrical repre- 
sentation of tiie British species in the following manner.
Each species 
was placed in a given plane with reference to two axes of co-ordinates, 
the abscissa being the same number of units of length as the normal 
number of stamens, and the ordinate being the number of veins on each

petal.
After being placed in this manner it appeared that the species 
numbered 1-5 in the fifth edition of Babington's ' Manual of British 
Botany ' lay in a straight line whose equation was x — 4< 1/ + 11 = 0, 
that those numbered 6-8 lay in a parallel straight line whose equation 
was X — 43^ + 6 = 0, and that the remaining four, 9-12, lay in a third 
straight line, whose equation was x — y = 4.
The accompanying figure was contained in the above-mentioned 
paper.
The unit of length is three-twentieths of an inch.

Axis of veins of petals.
In the same paper it was noticed that while in E.
confusus, Godr., the 
flowering peduncles are nearly straight, and the stamens are longer than 
the head of carpels ; in the allied R.
Baudotii, Godr., the stamens are 
shorter than the head of carpels, and the peduncles are much and firmly 
arched.
Thus a provision appears to be made to enable the pollen in 
eacb case easily to reach the stigmas and fertilization to take place.

SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
Nepenthes.
— Dr. Hooker has contributed to a recent number of 'Na- 
ture' the following summary of the distribution of the species of Nepenthes, 
which genus he has been monographing for the forthcoming volume of 
De Candolle's ' Prodromus.'— The genus Nepenthes extends from Mada- 
gascar on the west to N.E. Australia, the Louisiade Archipelago, and New 
Caledonia on the east ; embracing within these limits thirty species, most 
of which have well-marked characters in the pitcher, but which, wilh only 
two exceptions, present a wonderful uniformity in the structure of both 
flower and fruit.
It has two foci of maximum development ; the Malay 
Peninsula (including Sumatra), and Borneo, in Loth of which localities the 
species are not only more numerous, but more gigantic than in any other

country.
No fewer than twenty-one species inhabit these two countries, 
of whicli thirteen are common to both ; but, what is very remarkable, the 
intervening island of Java contains but one representative of the genus, 
and that a totally different species from either the Bornean or the Ma- 
layan ; thus confirming the fact first brought to light by the Dutch natu- 
ralists, of the close biological relationship between the two former locali- 
ties, to the exclusion of Java.
Only one species has a wide range, the N.
pk^llamphora, which extends from Sumatra to Borneo, Amboyua, China, 
etc., but is absent from the island of Java.
Proceeding from the Malayan islands westwards, we find one species in 
east Bengal, more allied to the Javanese than to any other ; another in Cey- 
lon, the old N.
dlstillatoria of Linnaeus (a name long usurped in our gardens 
by the Bengal plant), which presents the first departure from the typical 
structure of the genus, having a spreading paniculate inflorescence; a 
character shared by those in Madagascar and the Seychelles.
Proceeding 
fuilher west to the African islands, we find still further deviations from 
the type, which now extend to the structure of the seed and fruit ; for 
whereas all the eastern species have very long appendages to the seed, 
which are no doubt instrumental in its dispersion, these appendages are 
very short in the Madagascar species, and are wholly absent in the Sey- 
chelle one ; which thus presents a case analogous to that of the preva- 
lence of wingless insects on oceanic islets.
Lastly, the Seychelle Islands 
species further difi'ers from all others in the structure of its ovary and 
capsule.
To sum up, deviation from the type of the genus commences on the 
western confines of the principal centre of its distribution, namely in Cey- 
lon ; and the initial deviation, that met with in the Ceylon species, is the 
slightest, but is propagated (so to speak) westwards, equally characterizing 
the two African islands Pitcher-plants, which again deviate still further 
from the type ; the maximum deviation, however, occurs, not in the great 
sub-continental Island of Madagascar, where the endemic species has a 
considerable range ; but in the ver^^ small oceanic Archipelago of the Sey- 
chelles, Avhere the only native species is confined to the one mountain 
summit of one island of the group !
The only other fact that struck me as bearing upon this subject of dis- 
tribution is, that though present in the Seychelles, the genus Nepenthes is 
absent from the Mascarene group (Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodrigues).
This is only one instance of the broad distinction that exists between the 
vegetation of these Archipelagos, and which is in some way connected with 
the fact that the Mascarene group is volcanic, the Seychelles group formed 
of granite and quartz.
Coincident and perhaps co-ordinate Avith these 
phenomena of plant distribution, geographical position, and geological 
structure, are the facts that the flora of the Seychelle Archipelago is more 
Asiatic, and the florulfe of its several islets very uniform ; whilst the 
florulse of the islets of the Mascarene Archipelago differ wonderfully, and 
in their totality are more African than Indian.
The flora of the Mascarene 
group may hence be regarded either as a very ancient outlying province of 
the African, or as consisting of a more modern assemblage of plants, de- 
rived at various periods from Africa, but subsequently much altered by 
causes operating in the several islets ; or more probably its peculiarities 
are attributable to both causes.
Long as the Slascarene and Seychelle 
islets have been colonized, under Dutch, French, and English rule, their

floras are still very imperfectly known ; so much, however, of Mascarene 
botany is known, as to show that its relations with those of the Seychelle 
group and Madagascar, and the relations of all these with India and Africa, 
are most complicated, and present one of the most puzzling problems in 
Phytogeographical Science.
Empetrum nigrum, L.
— In reply to the Hon. J.
L. Warren's inquiry 
(p.
7), concerning this plant, allow me to say that I find it tolerably abun- 
dant on Cannock Chase, Staft'ordshire.
Cannock Chase is mostly a wild flat 
moorland, with only one or two slight elevations.
Enipetruni also grows 
on Sutton Coldfield, generally, here by ninning streams ; both these stations 
are recorded by Purton in his ' Midland Flora' (1818).
I also find an- 
other truly montane plant in both these localities, — Vucchiium Vitis-Idcea^ 
— rather plentiful and of vigorous growth on Cannock Chase, and scat- 
tered and more stunted in habit on Sutton Coldfield.
In the marshes of 
Cannock Chase and the bogs of Sutton Vaccinium Oxycoccus occurs.
I 
have no doubt that at one time all the country between Cannock and 
Sutton has been one large moorland.
At Sutton, too, I find two Mosses 
which may be considered as truly montane species, viz.
Amblyodon' deal- 
batus and Hypnum commututum, var.
condensatum.

When alcoholic ammonia acts at a tem- 
perature not above 100° C, on butyraldehyd, two bases are produced, — 
one, dibutyraldine, having the following composition : — 
CgHxyNO = SC^HgO -f NH3 - HjO.
Dibutyraldine.
Butyraldehyd.
By the dry distillation of dibutyraldine there is produced, among other 
products, a final one, which is found to possess all the characteristic pro- 
perties of — in fact, to be identical with — conia, the active principle of 
Hemlock (^Conium macnUttam) .
The reaction takes place as follows : —

Vegetable Broom-materials.
— The diff'erent vegetable-materials 
employed for making brooms and brushes are often the objects of inquiry, 
though they have been pretty well ascertained.
Brooms used for sweeping 
the streets, and also coarse scrubbing-brushes, are made with Piassaba 
fibre, which consists of the detached iibro-vascular bundles at the base of 
the petioles of a Brazilian Palm {Attalea fmiifera, Mi.), forming what is 
technically called the reticulum.
A finer fibre is obtanicd from another 
Palm, Leopoldinia Piassaba.
Softer scrubbing-brushes are made of Cocoa- 
nut fibre, the "coir" of commerce.
Carpet brooms and some kinds of 
clothes brushes are made of the panicles of the Broom-corn {Sorghum

vulgare, Pers.), after the grain lias been detached.
(The axes of the female 
spikes of another grass, Zea Mays, L., are sold in London under the name 
of "French firelights," at the rate of twelve a penny).
Fine hand- 
brushes for clothes are said to be made in Italy from the long fibrous 
roots (rhizomes) of a grass, Andropogon T&climnum, L.
(Jury's Eeport

A similar product of another 
species, A.
muricatmn, is the well-known khus-khus or veti-vert of per- 
fumers.
In the West of France I have seen brooms for sale made of the 
haulm of a species of Cameliua, — a way, no doubt, of working up a waste 
product in the cultivation of an oil-plant.
Finally, I learnt at Round- 
stone in Connemara that the beautiful Erica hihernica, Syme, locally 
known as French Heath, is found, from its miniature tree-like growth, to 
make capital brooms.

Perthshire Plants.
— In the report of the December meeting of the 
Edinburgh Botanical Society (p.
26), Dr. Dickson and Wx. Sadler are 
recorded to have found (Eiia)dhe pimpinelloldes and Pinipindla magna in 
Perthshire.
By the kindness of the latter botanist I have been favoured 
with specimens of both plants.
He says that they grew near Hamilton 
House, in meadow-ground by the side of a burn, in comi)any with P.
Saxifraga and Bntiium flexuosum.
Mr. Sadler adds that he first collected 
P. magna i\\e.rtm 18.
5 8 and believes it had been previously observed; 
he considers both plants to be " truly wild." Mr. Watson, who has seen 
specimens from Perthshire collected by Dr. Dewar, brackets province 15 
{vide ' Compendiun),' p.
190), intimating a suspicion of the species having 
been introduced there.
Whatever may be the real state of the case as 
regards this species, which certainly occurs in Yorkshire and Durham 
('Comp.' 1.
c.),any grounds of suspicion with regard to it must hold with still 
greater force in tlie case of (E.
piiripinelloides, a plant restricted to South 
England (north limit, Worcester and Sufl:'olk, ' Comp.' p.
192), and with a 
strong bias for low coast districts.
An outlying station so distant from 
the main area of the species must remain under a suspicion of introduction 
by human agency, at all events till some approach towards a bridge over 
the gap is made by the discovery of intermediate localities.* It is to be 
wished that some of the many local botanists of Scotland would carefully 
and impartially investigate the rather numerous cases where more or less 
of doubt rests upon the real nativity of species in the northern portion of 
Great Britain.
The addition of a species to the flora of any district is of 
no greater scientific importance than the exclusion of one by the demon- 
stration of a fallacy in its claims to nativity.
Mr. Watson has done 
excellent service, if he has applied his tests rigorously, in admitting into 
his summaries no alleged facts which will not bear a thorough scrutiny.
The form of Pimpinella magna sent to me by Mr. Sadler is one with the 
leaflets cut into linear segments, of which I have also seen specimens from 
Kent and Hertfordshire; it has a very different aspect to the normal 
form, and was distinguished by Morison (Hist.
Oxon.

and J.
Sherard (Ray, Syn. ed.

* Since this was written I have seen in the ' Scottish Naturalist ' (p.
'24) a 
remark by Mr. Dawson that "a number of curious plants growing near Hamilton 
House" were " probably introduced by the late Mr. Buchanan Hamilton." This 
may be considei'ed strong additional ground for distrust, and to turn the scale 
against the claim of CE.
pimpinelloichs.
SHORT NOTES AND aUEKIES.

notice in modem British Floras.
A parallel variety occurs in P.
Saxifraga 
as I have seen in Cheshire specimens.
Mr. Sadler has also kindly sent 
me a specimen of the Centaurea from the Ochil (not Achil, as printed at 
p. 28) Hills.
It is a rayed plant, and one of the numerous intermediates 
between typical C.
Jacea and C.
7ii(/ra, which have been collectively called 
C. nigrescens, but divided into many " species " by Boreau and other 
French botanists.
This Perthshire plant is, of the extremes, nearer 
C. Jacea than C.
nigra, the upper phyllary-appendages being more lace- 
rated than pectinate, and quite covering the phyllaries themselves.
Mr.
Sadler has named it C.
prateims, Thuill., a sufficiently accurate deter- 
mination if we may trust Billot's and other published Continental speci- 
mens.
Its different aspect and involucres distinguish it from the usual 
South and West of England rayed form, which is, perhaps, C.
serotina 
of Boreau, wrongly quoted as a synonym of C.
amara, L., in Gren.
and

Ambrosia peruviana, Willd: — In 1863 I met with a single individual 
of this species in a stubble field at Margate, Kent.
Very much puzzled 
what to make of it, I, by chance, showed it to Dr. Seemann, who imme- 
diately recognized it as a South American weed he was quite familiar 
with.

" Babington's curse " (p.
24.) — Perhaps this name is a reminiscence 
of a passage in the Rev. Charles Kingsley'«s 'Miscellanies,' vol.
i. p.
181.
Describing the vegetation of a chalk-stream, he proceeds : — " To this list 
will soon be added our Transatlantic curse, Bahingtonia diaboUca, alias 
Aiiacharis Ahinadrum.
It has already (1858) ascended the Thames as 
high as Reading ; and a few years more, owing to the present aqua viva- 
riiiii/ mania, will see it filling every mill-head in England, to the torment 
of all millers.
Young ladies are assured that the only plant for their 
vivariums is a sprig of Anacharis, for which they pay sixpence — the market 
value being that of a wasp, flea, or other scourge of the human race; and 
when the vivarium fails, its contents, Anacharis and all, are tost into the 
nearest ditch ; for which the said young lady ought to be fined five pounds, 
and would he if Governments governed.
What an ' if!'" It is almost a 
dangerous experiment to parody so closely formal botanical names ; syno- 
nyms have been quoted pedantically quite as absurd.

Alyssum incanum, L.
— In answer to INIr. Watson's question in Vol.
VIII.
p. 383, 1 beg to say that I picked a single specimen of Alyssum 
incanum in a clover-field about two miles from Ross, Herefordshire, in the 
summer of either 1866 or 1867.
The plant was solitai-y ; nor have I 
noticed it before or since in the same locality.

Galium tricorne, With., is usually described as having umbellate 
cymes with oidy 1-3 flowers.
In examples, however, which I met with 
in a potato-field at Garden Clift", Gloucestershire, the cymes are com- 
pound with as many as nine pedicels, not always equally fruit-bearing, 
though in most instances both the cocci are developed.

— The branches spring 
from a tuber, and are twining, cylindrical, and puberulous, destitute of 
spines.
The leaves are alternate, loosely scattered (2-3 inches apart), 
provided with puberulous leaf-stalks, thickened at the base, and as long 
as the blade of the leaf, Avhich latter is in general outline, roundish, and 
digitate.
Leaflets 5-7, petiolulate (petiolules ^ inch long, thickened at 
the base), slightly downy, especially below and along the nerves, oblong 
obtuse, sometimes markedly retuse, rounded at the base, sinuous at the 
margins, 1-nerved, the midrib excurrent into a rather long, slender acu- 
men.
Racemes axillary, slender, pendulous, as long as the leaf-stalks, 
1^2 inches long, many-flowered.
Flowers pendent, less than a quarter 
of an inch long, on short downy pedicels, provided at the apex with two 
ovate-oblong acuminate bracts, unequal in size and shorter than the flower.

Female flower unknown.
It is probable 
that a specimen (without number), gathered by Gerard at Natal, and also 
preserved at Kew, is the female of this plant.
In the latter the leaf-lobes 
are narrower, more tapering, and much more tomentose than in Messrs.
Veilch's plant ; the flower-spikes are axillai-y, tomentose ; the ovaries are 
also clothed with a dense coat of down, and are shorter than the subtend- 
ing bracts; the segments of the perianth are oblong-obtuse.

like it in aspect, as handsome if the element of size be disregarded, closely 
allied to it in the construction of its flowers, and on botanical grounds 
equally interesting.
Like the Godtcitiia, this Aroid was first grown in 
this country by Mr. W.
Bull, in one of whose stoves the plant was in 
bloom in January, 1870.
Its nearest ally seems to be the old Dracontium 
poly phj Hum, from which it differs in one or two important points.
The 
native country of our present plant is western tropical Africa, while D.
polyphylluni.
is a native of Surinam.
From Godicinia our plant differs in 
the simultaneous production of leaf and flower, in the stamens being equal 
in number to the segments of the perianth, not twice their number, etc.
Other points of difierence may be seen by comparing the description of 
that plant with that we now subjoin.
Root-stock or corm of the size of 
a small Turnip, of a depressed spheroidal form, giving off fleshy roots 
from its upper surface only, exactly as in some Cyclamens.
Leaves one, 
or sometimes two, arising from the stock.
Leaf-stalk erect, 5-6 feet high 
and upwards, terete or nearly so, as thick as a man's thumb, or thicker at 
the base, gradually tapering upwards, covered by an epidermis which is 
smooth and pinkish above, but from the middle downwards is marked by 
small, scattered, conical asperities, and wavy bands or blotches of a 
purplish colour mottled with white.
The interior of the leaf-stalk is 
traversed by a great number of longitudinal air-canals, somewhat sym- 
metrically disposed, the larger in the centre, the smaller at the circum- 
ference.
The upper extremity of the leaf-stalk divides into three primary 
branches, which are bent horizontally nearly at right angles to the main 
stalk, and each of which is terete and slightly channelled on the upper 
surface; the central branch is undivided, but each of the two lateral ones 
divides about 4 inches from its base into two widely divergent branchlets.
The blade of the leaf spreads horizontally, measures 3-4 feet across, and 
is pedately divided into three (or into five) main subdivisions, one central 
and four lateral, two on each side ; of these latter the uppermost pair are 
again dichotomously divided towards the apex.
Each of the main sub- 
divisions measures from 12-15 inches in length, is obovate in general 
outline, dark green above, paler beneath, perfectly smooth, unequally and 
uninterruptedly pinnatipartite; the central lobes of each of these main 
subdivisions are opposite to each other and larger than the rest, which are 
alternate and decurrent at the base along the upper side of the rachis, 
thus connecting all the segments together; the ultimate segments or par- 
titions are in all cases oblong-lanceolate, acuminate, entire, perforated here 
and there by irregular holes (d), and traversed by a central rib, promi- 
nent on the under- surface, and from the sides of which are given off 
arcuate secondary veins, which become confluent into an intramarginal 
nerve running round the segment ; the scape or peduncle is erect, terete, 
5-6 inches high, as thick as a swan's quill, smooth, rosy-pink, and having 
precisely the same anatomical structure as the leaf-stalk, but witli smaller 
cells and air-canals ; the spathe is erect, boat-shaped, leathery, convolute 
at the extreme base, prolonged above into a long incurved acumen, ex- 
ternally convex, smooth, purplish-brown, traversed by 7-9 prominent 
nerves, converging at the apex, internally concave, smooth, rich purple in 
colour; the spadix is supported within the spathe on a short cylindrical 
rosy stalk, ^ inch long, as thick as a goose-quill ; the spadix itself is 
erect, cylindrical, about 2 inches long, as thick as a swan's quill, and 
densely covered with ebracteate, monochlamydcous, hermaphrodite flowers

expanding from above downwards; tlie perianth (a) consists of 6-7-9 
distinct spatluilate segments, liooded at the top, imbricate in testivation, 
and marked by purplish spots ; the stamens are equal in number to the 
perianth segments, and opposite to them ; the filaments are erect, flat, 
ribbon-like, pale rose-coloured, ultimately pi'ojecting beyond the segments 
of tlie perianth, and attached to the back of the anther below the middle , 
the anthers are oblong obtuse, extrorse, yellow, 2-lobed, lobes obtnse, 
bursting at the sides by a terminal pore, which sometimes lengthens into 
a fissure.
Pollen ellipttcal.
The ovary is superior, sub-spheroidal, ob- 
scurely 3-lobed, 3-celled, with an axile placenta, disse|)iments sometimes 
complete, in other flowers partially deficient.
Style terminal, longer than 
the ovary, and protruding beyond the perianth, conical, thick, fleshy, 
curved, purple, terminated by a three-rayed brownish pajjillose stigma.
Ovules solitary in each cell of the ovary, kidney-shaped, attached to the 
placenta by a very short funiculus.
On first opening the spathe it appears 
as if the upper part of the spadix were covered by stamen-bearing flowers 
and the lower part by female flowers, the styles of which are directed up- 
wards.
In reality, all the flowers are hermaphrodite in structure, though 
not so in function ; the stamens in the upper flowers (a) protrude and 
shed their pollen upon the upturned stigmas of the lower flowers (b), 
whose own stamens are still immature and enclosed within the perianth.
Obviously this is a provision for a division of labour, as the pollen of the 
upper flowers impregnates the stigmas of the lower ones.
These questions 
then arise : how, if at all, do the upper flowers get fertilized ?
and what pur- 
pose does the pollen of the lower flowers serve ?
The answers to these ques- 
tions are not at present forthcoming.
In the accompanying plate (t.
113) 
for which w^e are indebted to Dr.
]\Iasters, the entire plant is shown much 
reduced in size; (a) is a flower from the upper part of the spadix; (b), 
from the lower part, with the style protruding ; (c) is a vertical section 
through the ovary, showing the attachment of the ovules, (d) one of the 
terminal leaf-lobes with its perforation.

the Museum, has addressed to the Academy of Sciences the following 
protest: — "The garden of medicinal plants, founded in Paris by an edict 
of King Louis XIIL, dated January 3rd, 1626, became a Museum of 
Natural History on the 23rd of May, 1794.
It was bombarded in the 
reign of William I., King of Prussia, Count Bismarck being chancellor, by 
the Prussian army, on the night of the 8th and 9th of January, 1871.
Until then it had been respected by all parties, and by all national and 
foreign authorities.
— Paris, January 9th, 1871." The Academy has de- 
termined that the protest of M.
Chevreul shall be printed at the head of 
its reports, and the Committee of Professors of the jNIuseum have decided 
that a marble monument, with an inscription of the protest, shall be placed 
in one of the galleries of the building, surrounded with projectUes thrown

These agree in stating that the grain was brought fi'om Sifan (or Lower

the end of the fifteenth century, though the date of its importation is no- 
where even hinted at.
The paper is illustrated with reproductions of the

Several papers and reviews stand over for want of space.
[Mr. H.
C. Watson has printed and circulated amongst botanists a 
protesti, in the form of a letter to one of the editors of this Journal, against 
the notice of the third part of the ' Compendium of the Cybele Britannica,' 
which appeared in these pages last December (Journ.
of Bot. Vol.
VIII.
pp.
394-397).
As this printed letter denies the truth of certain state- 
ments contained in that notice, it was thought desirable that it should be 
placed before all the readers of the Journal.
Mr. Watson was tlierefore 
requested to allow it to be stitched into the cover of the present number, 
the Journal ofiering to be at the expense of printing the necessary copies, 
but to this request he returned a decided refusal.
It would occupy too 
much space to reprint the letter ; probably, however, those who care to 
see it, will be able to obtain a copy by application to the author.
The 
reviewer's answer to Mr. Watson is printed below.
16M Januunj, 1871.
Dear Mr. Watson, 
I have carefully read through the printed letter which you have sent 
rae, and which, though addressed to Mr. Baker, is directed against me, 
the author of the review to which you object ; and I feel it necessary to 
answer it.
It exhibits four charges against me : 1st, that I have misre- 
presented you ; 2nd, that I have unjustly charged you with omission or 
neglect ; 3rd, that I have insinuated piracy or plagiarism on your part ; 
4th, that I have exhibited an unwarranted "dogmatism, arising "from io-no- 
rance and a desire to display a fancied superiority.
I Avill dispose of these charges in order.
1st.
The " misrepresentation." The statement objected to, I repeated 
from a review of the first part of the ' Compendium' (also written by me) 
in the 'Journal of Botany' for December 1868 (Vol. VI.
p. 375)!
As 
you took no exception to that notice, and have continued your contribu- 
tions to the Journal and friendship towards me, I had no' reason to sup- 
64 BOTANICAL NE'WS.
pose that any statement in it was eiToneous.
I greatly regret that I have 
attributed to you words that you have not published.
2nd.
The " charge of neglect." The notice of Callitriclte truncata ap- 
peared in the number of the 'Journal of Botany' for May, 1870.
At p.
505 of the third part of your ' Compendium' — and I beg you to notice 
that my review is of that part alone, and not as you imply (' Letter,' pp.
1, 4), of the whole book — under Rnbiis obliqwts you quote from that Jour-

where it was not discovered till July 1870.
As the " Notes and Correc- 
tions" occupy pp.
606-615, they must have been printed after the date 
last mentioned, July 1870, and the non-insertion of CaUitriche truncata 
in those " notes and corrections," may f;iirly be held an " omission." 
3rd.
The "implied charge of piracy or plagiarism." The paragraph 
you quote from my review will not fairly bear any such interpretation.
I used the word " requisition " — without a thought of the Franco- 
Prussian war— to imply that you had quoted, made use of, drawn upon 
the pages of the ' Journal of Botany ' in a legitimate and necessary 
manner.
By " insufficiently quoted," I meant that, instead of giving 
volume and page, you had been often satisfied with such references as the 
following: — "Jour.
Bot. no.
34" (instead of vol.
iii.
p. 328), "Journal 
of Botany, no.
69 " (instead of vol.
vi.
p. 263), " Journal of Botany, 1867 " 
(omitting references to pages 76 and 279), "Journal of Botany, no.
70" 
(instead of vol.
vi.), occurring on pages 475, 530, 549, 609 of this part 
of the ' Compendium,' and noted down in rapidly going through it.
4th.
A wider issue is here raised.
Everybody knows that it is no part 
of the duties of a reviewer to completely elucidate all the doubts and 
difficulties of the author of the book under notice.
The passage which 
you quote (' Letter,' p.
6) from my review was given by me as an example 
of your habitual neglect in this part of the ' Compendium ' to use all the 
means at your command for the clearing up of doubtful points.
Your 
'Letter 'makes this want of thoroughness still more evident; indeed, it would 
seem that, so far as the ultimate data, that is, the plants themselves, are 
concerned, this part of the ' Compendium ' is little or nothing more than 
a digest of or index to your own herbarium.
There was a moral obligation 
on an author on British geographical botany to, as far as possible, get to 
the bottom of such a case as the alleged occun-ence of Hieracium prcncox 
in Britain, and my criticism was, and is, that you neglected to take the 
absolutely necessary step towards a solution of your difficulty.
The 
existence in your herbarium of twenty-one specimens labelled by Schultz 
Hieracium jjr^scox, and one specimen of a lUeraclnm, collected by Mr.
J. E.
Bowman, at Dinas Bran, is entirely beside the question, which can 
be decided only by an examination of the specimen at the British ]\Iuseura, 
named by Schultz Hm-acium prrecox, and published by him in the 
' Journal of Botany.' I must still hold to my opinion that such neglect 
has caused a real defect in the third part of the ' Compendium,' and ren- 
dered it less useful than it might have been.
Into the region of mere personalities I must decline to follow you.
Of 
course I shall publish this letter.
Believe me, dear Mr. Watson, 
Yours faithfully, 
Henry Trim en.]

Many of the ante-Limieaa European botanists recognized five distinct 
species.
Scattered over most parts of the world, growing in ponds, pits, ditches, 
streams, rivers and even seas, occasionally also at tlie edges of watery 
places and on mud ; mentioned as occurring in Colombia, S.

and Endlicher.
Generally perennial, but occasionally annual.
The fol- 
lowing groups and forms give the principal modifications of this poly- 
morphous species, but by no means exhaust its variability ; numerous 
intermediate states exist that cannot be completely identified with any 
of them : —

Linnaeus gave four varieties of this, which are mentioned lielow

De Lamarck divided it into two species, aquatlcus and jluitans ; 
Brotero, in a difl'erent manner, into two, lieterophijllm and pan- 
tothrlx ; and various later writers into several others.
The petals 
are occasionally more than Ave in number, as, for example, in peni- 
cillatns, floribundas, Drouetii, and Jlieita us, though in all the forms five 
is the normal number.

This can usually be separated from fiidtaus by the slenderer or 
shorter segments of the sid:)mersed leaves (which are nearly always 
present) and by the hairy receptacle ; but neither of these character^ 
is quite trustworthy.
When the petals are equal to or shorter than 
the sepals, the state is called by Schlechtendal in Aniraadv.

It has not yet been noticed in Britain, but ought to be looked for.

NOTES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALGiE.
By G, Dickie, A.M., M.D.
{Read at the Meeting of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, Jan.
\2th, 1871.) 
The result of dredging near the " Maiden Eocks" in relation to range 
in depth of Algfe, formed the subject of a paper to the Society in 1869 ; 
having some years before made a passage in the lighthouse tender from 
Larne, the nearest port, I have thought that notes of the AlgjB found on 
them might deserve to be recorded, especially when contrasted Avith those 
of the neighbouring shore.
The " Maidens" are about six to seven miles 
from the Antrim coast, they are in close proximity, of small extent, and 
each mainly occupied by lighthouse-buildings, presenting but few crevices 
where land plants can grow, of which I only found three, viz.
Matricaria 
iuodora, var.
/3.
maritima, and two species of Atriplex.
The two small 
islands in question rise abruptly, having deep water near them ; they are 
in fact the rugged tops of a submerged mass of basalt.
The visit was made about the end of June (a month or two later would 
have been more favo\irable), the time allowed was limited ; I, however, col- 
lected every seaweed that could be seen, and all were kept separate in my 
herbarium.
The following is a list : —

This list is very meagre compared with the species found on the nearest 
coast, where the prevailing rock is hard chalk ; the following are among 
the more remarkable of these, — most of them are not merely plentiful, but 
notable for their size :* — Laminaria jiJiylUtis, L.

etc.
The species already mentioned as found on the " Maidens" are gene- 
rally very dwarf; they also grow on the nearest coast, where they attain 
much greater size.
Hard chalk being the prevalent rock in the one case, 
and rugged basalt the habitat in the other, the contrast as to size, as well 
as number, might be attributed to difference in chemical composition ; 
the small e,\.tent of surface at the " Maiden Rocks," freely exposed to all 
the storms of the Channel, and therefore unfavourable to the growth of 
many species, is the most probal)le cause ; on the Antrim coast sheltered 
pools and crevices abound, and tlicse day after day in summer, during ebb, 
Candolle in 1824, S.
O. Gray, in a popular account of British Algse, has given tlie 
name Maugeria, in honour of a lady collector ; I follow Le Jolis's ' Alga) of Cher- 
bourg,' in adopting Stackhouse's name, Tentamen, etc., 1809.
* See Memoir of late Professor Harvey, p.
220, in a letter he alludes to the size

to cover an ordinary round drawing-room table.

receive the full influence of the sun's rays, which certainly affects the 
mean temperature.
The Algic of the " Maidens," with few exceptions, have a wide rano;e in 
latitude and louf^itude on the British and Irish coasts ; Alaria and Oclon- 
thalia are chiefly confined to the Northern shores.
As to the relation betvveen the kind of rock and the distribution of Alj?fe, 
it may be sufficient to observe that the more abundant and widely diffused 
are found indift'orently on rocks of the most opposite character; that 
liabitat does, however, modify the composition of at least one common 
species seems proved by the following instance.
"VVlien passing the co;ist 
at Bay of Nigg, near Aberdeen, in September last (1870), I observed an 
iron chain newly brought to shore which had been during six months in 
four to five fathoms water, it was completely covered by the Rhodi/mejiia 
palmata ; attached to tliis chain there was a piece of hempen rope, about 
three feet in length, which had a crop of Polyuphonia Brodirei ; these were 
the only species, and each was strictly confined to the chain in the one 
case, and to the rope in the other.
The Polysiphonia was of good size, 
nearly as large as it occurs on the neighbouring rocks ; the Rhodymema 
was dwarf, two or three inches, paler and more delicate than usual ; of 
the last I collected sulhcient for analysis, and am indebted for a report to 
my friend and former pupil, J.
C. Brown, D.Sc. Lond., and Lecturer on 
Toxicology, Medical School, Liverpool ; he was very careful to avoid any 
source of fallacy.
Rhodymenia from iron chain, 
Iron = 0-01 13 per cent, of dry plant, 
or 0'235 per cent, of tlie aslies.
RJiodymenia from granite rocks.
Bay of Nigg, 
Iron = 00035 per cent of the dry plant, 
or 0"056 per cent, of the ashes.
It can scarcely be that in this case each plant "selected" its special ha- 
bitat; Rhodymenia is a common perennial species, the Polysiphonla appears 
only toward the end of summer.
The fishermen at the salmon station 
assured me that chain and rope were quite clean when put into the sea; 
it is probable that the piece of rope had been in some way bedded in sancl 
or mud, which having been, towards the end of the season, washed away 
by currents, the Polysiphonla grew on it, the chain having been previously 
covered with a thick crop of the Rhodymenia.
A SUPPLEMENT TO THE 'FLORA VECTENSIS.' 
By Alexander G.
More, E.L.S., M.R.l.A.
During the fourteen years which have elapsed since the publication, in 
1856, of Dr. Bromfield's 'Flora Vectensis,' several plants have been 
added to the list, and the discovery of many new localities for rare species 
has rendered the botany of the Isle of Wight much better known.
The 
present seenis a good opportunity for bringing together various contribu- 
tions received from other botanists, which, joined to the results of my 
own observations during seven years' residence at Bembridge, from ISo'G 
to 1862, will serve, in some measm-e, as a continuation of the successful 
hibours of the late Dr. Bronifield.
A SUPPLEMENT TO THE * FLORA VECTENSIS.' 73 
In drawing up the following list, I gladly acknowledge the great 
assistance which I have, on many occasions, received from my friends 
Messrs.
Babington, Boswell Syme, Watson, Baker, and others, who, in 
cases where I have felt any doubt, have continually given me the advan- 
tage of their opinion.
^Tlie late Mr. A.
J. Hambrough, of Steephill, Mr. F.
Stratton, Mr. J.
Pristo, and others of my friends have supplied a large number of loca- 
lities.
Mr. Stratton has also extracted from a copy of the ' Flora Vec- 
tensis ' some memoranda left by the former owner, the late Major H, 
Smith, whose observations-, however, must be received with some degree 
of reserve.
Dr. G.
R. Tate has kindly placed at my disposal a series of 
notes made during his stay at Freshwater, from 1865 to 1868, antl Mr.
J. G.
Baker has favoured me with his observations on Yectensian lioscs 
and R/ibi, made in 1868.
A few of the following plants are included in a " Catalogue of the 
Plants of the Isle of Wight," published by me in the 'Annual lleport for 
1859 of the Isle of Wight Pliilosophical Society,' and intended to serve 
as an index to tlu^ herbarium of Dr. Bromfield, which is preserved at 
Ryde, in the rooms of the Society.
Some of the localities and plants 
have also been noticed by myself in the botanical portion of the Appendix 
to ' A New Guide to the" Isle of Wight,' by the Rev. E.
Venables (1860), 
or from year to year in the ' Phytologist,' the 'Reports of the Botanical 
Exchange Club,' or the ' Journal of Botany,' but many, especially of the 
critical forms, have not yet been recorded.
It is to be remembered that the localities here given do not pretend to 
show the complete range in the Isle of Wight of any of the plants, but 
are strictly supplementary to those given l)y Dr. Bromfield in his ' Flora 
Vectensis * (1856), and in his "Catalogue of the Plants growing wild in 
Hampshire," published in the 'Phytologist,' o.s. vol.
iii.
and iv.
(ISi?- 
1851).
The marks of naturalization are used, as I have employed them else- 
where, the single dagger f for cases of slight suspicion, for plants which 
now appear native, but were possibly introduced.
The doid)le dagger J 
for plants probably introduced, including nearly all the regular colonists 
or cornfield weeds, which spring up, year after year, in cultivated land.
The asterisk * is used for plants certainly introduced.
Within the 
brackets [] are included plants which are nowhere permanently esta- 
blished, but occur occasionally as escapes from cultivation, or by some other 
accident, without being self-supporting, also numerous species which have 
been evidently planted, and have scarcely yet strayed beyond the limits of 
gardens, houses, or intentional cultivation, and the extinct plants.
The 
mark !
is employed in a few cases where I have examined a dried speci- 
men, though I have not gathered the plant.

A form without floating leaves occurs 
in the marsh ditches on the north side of Brading Harbour.
Specimens 
of this are preserved in Dr. Bromfleld's herbarium under the name of 
" R.
circinaius," Sibth., which has not yet been found.
R. BaudoUi, Godr.
Ditches on the north side of Brading Harbour, 
abundantly (1856) ; also in a pond between the harbour and Yaverland 
Farm.
In Saltern's Marsh between Sea Yiew and Springvale.
R. peltatns, Fries.
Common.
By this name I understand a large- 
flowered and luxuriant plant, which is abundant in the marsh ditches near 
Sandown, and in many other parts of the island.
The early floating 
leaves are often nearly peltate, with five rounded sub-entire lobes (var.
quinqnelobus, Koch), but the leaves produced later in the season are reui- 
form, often nearly truncate at the base, with a tendency in this case to 
become three-lobed, the central lobe being separated from the others, still 
it is rounded at the margin, and nearly always entire.
This is prolDably 
the variety named " tnuicutm " in the French Floras of Cherbourg and 
Dinan, and I believe it is also this plant which, in rapid streams, becomes 
R. pseudo-flidtans, in which the truucate-reniform shape of the floating 
leaves still continues, but their segments become more acute, and are often 
drawn out at the tip into long points.
From R.
peUatm I do not feel any confidence in separating R.jlori- 
bundus, though I believe the name may fairly be applied to a plant with 
the peltate floating leaves more deeply divided, and their segments more 
notched, and which I have gathered, here and there, in ponds and ditches 
in various parts of the Isle of Wight.
It is to be noted that, as in others 
of this section, the early flowers of R.
peltatns are much larger, and the 
petals more full and rounded, than those which are produced later in the 
season.
R. Lenormandi, Schultz.
Plentiful on several parts of Pan Connnon, 
especially at the western end.
In a ditch close to Alverstone Lynch.
Ditches in the Wilderness at Hookley, and near Lashmere Pond.
Far 
less common with us than R.
hederaceus, and apparently restricted to a 
sandy soil.

This is very ditferent

lakes, and is probably no more than a procumbent form of growth assumed 
in autumn by R.
Flammiila.

Probably not indigenous at St. Lawrence, 
where I have only seen it in and near to what was formerly a shrubbery

cum.
Mr. Stratton has observed one or two plants in a still more 
suspicious station, in a hazel copse close to the orchard at Apes Down 
Farm.

SHORT NOTES AND QUEEIES.
WoLFFiA.
IN Blossom.
— Mr. Henry Gillman, in the 'American.
Naturalist' for January, says, — " I have just found (August 28th, 1870) 
the JFolffia colnwbiaua, Karsten, flowering abundantly in a pool at Sand- 
wich, Ontario, on the Detroit river.
I discovered this station for it more 
than a year ago, but hitherto have failed to find the flowers till now.
Untold millions of these tiny plants covered the surface of tlie water, hid- 
ing it completely, and lying eii viasse at least three-quarters of an inch 
thick.
I found it also (though not fertile) some miles higher up the 
river, at Connor's Creek, Michigan, but nowhere else along the shores.
Though Gray says ' flowers and fruit not seen,' it has, I think, been 
found once in flower in the Catskills.
The delicate white flowers dis- 
appear soon after taking it from the water, but on placing some next day 
in my aquarium the little plants at once ' righted themselves,' and tlie 
flowers almost instantly reappeared, expanding fresh as ever from the 
centre of the frond.
Last year, in the same pool, it was quite abundant, 
growing with Lemna minor, L., which was, however, largely in the 
majority.
Now I find the JFolffia has almost taken possession of the 
pool, driving out the Lemna, which is ' few and far between,' and of a 
sickly and clegraded type." The European (and British) species, IF.
arrhiza, Wimm., has, 1 believe, been seen in flower hitherto only in West 
Africa by Dr. Welvvitsch, and his specimens were described and figured 
by Hegelmaier in this Journal, Vol. III.
p. 113, and tab.
29.
A hint iiere 
for those with aquaria who try to flower this tiny plant — stint it of water, 
and expose it to heat.
Perhaps growing it on flannel kept constantly 
wet with warm water, and exposed to the sun, might cause the reproductive 
energies to overcome the vegetative ones.

Plants of the Northern Suburbs of London, 1870.
— The 
vegetation of tlie outskirts of London includes a curious collection of 
waifs and strays.
It is often exceedingly puzzling to trace their source, 
though sometimes the c'ue seems more obvious.
This was the case with 
a new road near South End Green, Hampstead, which had been made but 
never used.
The flint ballast with which it had been covered was almost 
hidden by the rank-growing plants, amongst which were some large and 
conspicuous bushy individuals oi Atriplex marina, L.
Although this has 
been recorded for Middlesex by Petivcr (see ' Flora of Middlesex,' p.
236), 
it is usually so exclusively a littoral species that it makes the presump- 
tion very strong that the road had been made with shore-ballast.
The 
Kev. W.
M. Hind's locality for A.
Bahiur/totiii, Woods, between Kilburn 
and Kensal Green (vide 'Flora of Middlesex,' p.
238), was on sea- 
gravel.
With A.
marina, L., there was a curious assemblage of plants.
Heliunthus annuiis, L.
; Linaria minor, Desf., abundant and of a large 
size (this has otherwise seemed quite confined in Middlesex to the 
western half) ; Scrra/alciis secaliii/is, Bab.
; S.
arvei/sis, Godr.
; Jjolinm 
temulentum, L.
A very handsome Folygonmn seems to me to be the true 
P. Pensylvanicmn, L., though ]Mr. Watson, to whom T submitted a per- 
haps hardly sufficient scrap, prefers to call it P.
lapatJiifolium.
The 
colour of the perianth, a bright deep pink, gave the plant a gay appear- 
ance, suggesting an exaggerated state of P.
Fersicaria, from which, how- 
ever, the abundantly glandular peduncles at once separate it.
From 
F. lapatldfoliiim it is easily distinguished by the erect racemes and 
exserted stamens ; but, of course, if P.
Persicaria and P.
lapathifoUum 
were united as is done by Mr. Bentham, the aggregate species would 
have to include P.
Pensylvanicum also.
Besides the irrepressible Atri- 
plexes, Chenopodiums, and Polygonums of London suburbs, there was a 
tall-growing Chenopodium which, although very near C.
opulifolium, 
Schrader, seems quite distinct from it, not having its rhomboidal obtuse, 
almost 3-lobed leaves.
I am inclined to think it a more generalized 
type of that segregate of C.
album, L., of which C.
candicans, Lamk., is a 
rather abnormal state, certainly owing something of its habit to growing 
with cultivated crops.
My plant was a good deal branched with long 
leafy branches, the leaves sparingly mealy, ovate-rhomboidal deeply- 
toothed, and exceeding the short axillary spikes of mealy flowers.
Except 
that the foliage was greenish rather than glnucous-white, this agrees on 
the whole with the G.
album, L., of Boreau (Fl. du Cent, de la Fr. 2078).
The cornfield plant, which is the C.
album of the Linnsean herbarium, has 
the toothing of the leaves shallower.
Syme must have had some such 
plant as mine in view when he speaks of candicana reaching three feet in 
height, and being " rarely much branched." (E.
B. vol.
viii.
p. 14.) 
C. opulifolium has a glaucous mealiness over a rather dark green surface, 
which comes out through it in drying.

Chenopodiums sometimes present themselves in a very anomalous 
guise, and perhaps the most puzzling form I have come across is a state 
of C.

leaves, except a few slightly hastate with ascending lobes, are naiTOwly

The inflorescence, instead of forming 
dense leafy spikes, consists of small distant axillary cymes.

A curions point about London introduced plants is the general preva-

It 
is not improbable that the grain used for feeding horses may each year, 
from market contingencies, come mainly from some one source.
It seems 
qnite likely that the liorsebags of horses belonging to builders, cab- 
drivers, etc.
may be a quite important means of distributing small exotic 
seeds in the environs of large towns.

Barometric Plants.
— Linnaeus, in his 'Flora Lapponica,' writing 
on TrifoJium repens (274), states that is a common practice to predict 
(tanquam e Barometro) a coming storm by an inspection of this plant ; 
for when the air is hot then the leaves hang down, whereas when there is 
moisture in the air the leaves are erect.
This holds, he remarks, not only 
for the Trefoil, but also for most plants which have declining stamens 
i^' dadinata, deorsum inflexa instar Carinas Naviculae." Phil.
Bot. 1770, 
p. 219 ; cf.
Babington, sub voce).
All the flowers, too, generally con- 
verge (connivent) when a shower is impending, as though they knew 
that the water would interfere with the fertilization of the plant, for Avheu 
the fertilization has been effected no sucli convergency is exhibited (" quasi 
scientes aquam actum generationis turbare, coagulando vel diluendo fari- 
nara genitalem, cum actu generationis celebrato nulla conniventife signa 
ostendant").
He instances Mimosa, Cassia, Bauhinia, and their allies, as 
plants whose leaves converge every evening, even though there be no 
diminution of temperature.
He concludes by asking what is the cause of 
this sensitiveness, and what change there is in the night air beyond the 
absence of light and heat?
Dr. Hooker ('Student's Flora,' p.
79) states 
that the leaflets of Oxalis are pendulous at night, and often sensitive to 
light.
Of Anagallis arvensis he remarks that the corolla opens in clear 
weather, and other plants besides those specified doubtless obey the same 
law.
I would wish to repeat the question given above of the great 
botanist, in the hope that some reader of the Journal will be able to give 
an explanation of tliis curious phenomenon.
Will the same explanation 
account for the perhaps more singular circumstance that the Trayopogon 
pratensis, L., closes at noon ?

— Mr. H.
C. Watson, on pp.
3 and 
69 of vol.
i. (1847) of his ' Cybele Britannica,' gives " for the benefit of 
lady readers or others who are not familiar with Greek and Latin names," 
his pronunciation of the word "Cybele." Dictionaries are on Mr. Wat- 
son's side, yet one Virgil, no mean poet, required for his verse, not 
Cyb-ul-e but Cyb-e-le.
(See also Cyb. Brit.

(1859), and 'Com- 
pendium,' preface, p.
vi.
(1870).) Now this word is one for which there 
are two pronunciations, I think, fairly allowable, if a Latin author may be 
cited as a good authority for his own language ; but what amazes me and 
SUORT NOTES AND QUERIES.

equally worries me is the great diversity in the position of the accent sanc- 
tioned by the usage of our foremost botanical writers.
I go no further than 
these, for when we descend to the minora ddera^ the differences are greatly 
multiplied.
To prove my point I shall confine myself to the handbooks of 
Babington, fifth edition (B.), Hooker (H.), and Syme (S.), and Koch's 
' Synopsis ' (K.), taking some twenty plants and classifying my results.
B. 
and S.
agree in placing the accent on the penult in Corydalis, Reseda (K.), 
Oiiohrychh (K.), (Enothera, Cuscuta, A&perugo, Obione, L.
Martagon, A.
Scorodoprasum, etc., Tric/locJun (K.), P.
Hydroplper, Mi/rica (K.); whilst 
in all these cases H.
has the penult short, and K.
is silent unless inserted 
as above.
B. stands alone with accent on penult in Koniga (K.
is silent), 
Oxytropis, Doronicum (K.
silent), C.
Calcitrapa, Tul'ipa ; H.
stands alone 
in accented penult of Ornithopns, Comarum, Arnoseris, Arbutus (forgetting 
" viride membra sub arbuto stratus"), PJiyUodoce (K.
silent), P.
Coro- 
nopus (K.
silent) ; S.
alone shortens the penult in Petroselinum, Urtica ; 
K. differs from the English writers in placing the accent on the penult in 
Cephala)ithera, Gentaurea, Elatine ; H.
and S.
agree in lengthening the 
penult of Lapsana ; and finally, in the case of Radiola, B.
puts accent on 
0, H.
K. on i, and S.
on first syllable.
Similar differences might be 
easily multiplied, and will readily occur to botanists.
I think it would 
be a great advantage to have uniformity in this matter, and surely in the 
majority of the cases there is but one legitimate pronunciation, since the 
names are classical names and not anglicized forms.

DeI'Ikite and Indefinite Hhizomes.
— The division of axes into 
definite and indefinite has a very important meaning with reference to the 
general habit of plants.
Ordinarily speaking, that is to say, excepting 
only some wholly abnormal cases, when the terminal bud of an axis is 
developed into a flower, the growth of "the axis is arrested, and further 
increase can only take place by the production of axillary buds ; in such 
a case the axis is said to be definite.
On the other hand, if the axis is 
never terminated by a flower or by anything but a growing bud, its 
continuous growth will of course proceed unchecked, and it is said to be 
indefi.nite.
A general principle of this kind includes all that is stated in 
books about definite and indefinite rhizomes, branching, inflorescence.
The only difterence between a conn and a rootstock, or rhizome, consists 
in the fact that a corm is only of a year's duration, while a rootstock 
consists of a string of annual growths, which remain persistently attached.
Tlie only difference, for example, between the corm of Arum maculatum 
and the rhizome of Solomon's-seal lies in the persistence of the old axes 
in the latter case and their decay in the former.
In both, the terminal 
bud of the subterranean horizontal axis turns up and produces an aerial 
development of inflorescence and leaves.
The underground growth' is 
carried on by the elongation, later in the year, of an axillary bud.
This 
is the typical arrangement of a definite rhizome, and it is, perhaps, the 
most common.
Excellent illustrations are supjflied by the Bamboo and 
the genus Iris, as limited by Mr. Baker.
According to fig.
130 in 
Henfrey's 'Elementary Course,' the Cowslip also has the flowering stem 
produced by a terminal bud.
This would make it an instance of a definite 
rhizome, but this is almost certainly an error.
Throughout the Primu- 
lacea, axillary inflorescence is the general rule, whether the main axis be 
erect, prostrate, or subterranean.
The genus Prhnula is no exception, as 
80 NEW SPECIES OF PHANEROGAMOUS PLANTS.
is correctly pointed out with a figure in Dresser's ' Elements of Botany ' 
(p.
70, fig.
72).
Other examples of an indefinite rhizome are supplied by 
Menyanthes trifoliata and Butotnits timheUatus.
St. Hilaire (' jMorphologie 
Yegetale ') gives Scirpns palnsfi-is and mnlticaidis, but it seems probable 
that the Cyperacece have all definite rhizomes as Avell as Juncea: and 
grasses.
However, the underground economy of plants is an almost 
untouched subject in this country, although every collecting botanist 
might contribute something to our knowledge by the dissection and study 
of promising specimens.

Of the 35S pages of which this volume consists, sixty-eight, at the out- 
side, are the production of the gentleman whose name stands alone on the 
title-page, lie is responsible for the account of the few vertebrates of the 
It^les, and for the scanty lists of Ilymenoptera and Lepidoptera.

business, however, is not with the zoolo<jical side of tlie book, but with the 
more extensive catalogue of plants by which nearly two-thirds of it is occu- 
pied.
For the list of flowering: plants and Ferns botanists are indebted 
to Mr. H.
C. Watson, for that of the Mosses and Ueputica to Mr. Mitten.
We are so much accustomed to look upon Mr.
"Watson as our veteran 
British botanist, that it is a small surprise to find him occupying himself 
with the flora of a foreign land ; it is probable that many of our readers 
now learn, for the first time, that, so long back as 1842, Mr. Watson 
spent four mouths on one of H.
M.'s shi[)s (then engaged in surveying 
the Azores) examining, as well as such circumstances would allow, the 
vegetation of those islands.
Some results of this expedition, as far as 
botany is concerned, will be found in vols.
ii.
and iii.
of Sir W.
Hooker's 
' London .Journal of Botany,' the latter of which contains a full list of all 
the species then known.
To this were added in the sixth volume, some 
fifty more found by Mr. Hunt, a resident in St. Michael's.
Mr. Watson 
himself collected some 340 species, and for the last twenty-five years has 
had many in cultivation in his garden.
From all this it will be evident 
that he is very well fitted, from his own observation, to write an Azorean 
flora, whilst it is scarcely necessary to say that in estimating the value of 
the alleged facts of other observers no botanist has had more experience 
than Mr. Watson.
In our volume for 1867 (Vol. V.
p. 89), M.
Drouet's 'Catalogue de la 
Flore des lies Azores,' published the previous year, was noticed, and 
the careless manner in which, from ignorance of synonymy, the list of 
species is unduly extended, was alluded to.
In the catalogue before us, 
Mr. Watson credits Mr. Drouet and his fellow-collectors with the ad- 
dition of but thirteen species to those previously known.
The whole 
number of species enumerated in Mr. Watson's list is 478, and it is 
probal)le that further research would not greatly add to this number, as 
Mr. Godman, who collected in 1865, and brought over a fine series of 
specimens, some or all of which are now in the Kew herbarium, oidy 
added six species.
Of the whole number, the author has seen specimens 
of all but thirty-eight, and of these some will probably turn out to 
be errors of name.
This is not a large flora for a group of nine islands, 
lying between 37° and 40° N.
latitude; and even of these species not a 
few are likely to be recent introductions from Europe.
The nearest point 
of the Continent to the Azores is the southern part of Portugal, distant 
some 750 or 800 miles, and as Dr. Hooker has pointed out, the Azorean 
flora is mainly S.
European or Mediterranean ; about 400 species are com- 
mon to Europe and the Azores, and it is especially to the rich and varied 
flora of the Peninsula that the island vegetation has the greatest affinity.
Mr. Watson gives a list of ten Azorean species which occur in Europe in 
the Peninsula alone, and his surmise of this list being probably incomplete 
is doubtless correct ; published mntter on the Portuguese flora is very 
scanty, but an examination of Dr. Welwitsch's extensive collection made 
in Algarvia, the southernmost province of Portugal, would, it is believed, 
add to its flora several species now supposed to be restricted to the Atlantic 
isles.
Of the European species found in the Azores, more than 270 
appear to be British ; the south-west part of Ireland is next after Portugal 
the part of Europe nearest to the islands, and it is interesting to find some 
characteristic Irish species in iheir flora, Dabeocia  poUfoUa and Trichomanes 
sjjtciu6am, for example.
After deducting these Eiirojiean species, some 
NEW PLiBLICATIONS.
87 
eighty remain, forming pnrt of the "Atlantic element" of Dr. Hooker;* 
about thirty-six only, however, are common to the Azores and the 
Madeira and Canaries groups, and from this short list probably a quarter 
must be subtracted for various reasons ; yet Madeira is but five hundred 
miles distant.
The relationship with America is singularly slight, four 
species only of those which are neither European nor Madeiran being 
common to that continent and the Azores.
The widely spread African 
shrub Myrsiue ofrlcana alone (of the same list) represents the flora of the 
much nearer continent of Africa, which is only what might be expected 
when we remember bow small an African element is found, even in the 
Canarian flora.
The remai'kable fact remains, that forty species (one-twelfth of the whole 
flora) are peculiar to the islands.
A list of tiiese will be of value to our 
readers : — Cardamiue Caldeiranum, Nasturtium Jlexnosum, Cerustinm azo-

D. azorica, Holcus rlyidus, 
Festuca petrcea, Isoetes azorica.
It will be observed that, with the excep- 
tion of Seubertla and Microderis, all the genera are European.
As above 
hinted, this list is likely to be somewhat reduced by a more systematic ex- 
amination of the plants of Portugal.
As, however, Mr. Watson, who has 
had many of these specially Azorean plants under cultivation, finds them 
to recjuire a damp, equable climate, such as is found in their native 
islands, and to be quite unfitted to endure a Continental one, we can only 
expect the more robust species as the Carlces and grasses to be found in 
Europe.
A useful table is added to the catalogue, showing the distribu- 
tion (approximately) of the Azorean plants through Europe, Madeira, 
Canaries, Africa, and less completely America.
It would have been in- 
teresting to have traced, as far as is possible, each species through the 
nine ishmds composing the Azorean group.
Mr.
^Yatson has defined elsewhere some half-dozen of the novelties of 
the ishmds, and in the volume before us he fully describes Flcla Dtai- 
neslaita, found by Mr. Hunt, in St. Michael's, a remarkable plant, with 
large flowers, which change colour during their expansion.
Tlie Spergularla 
of the Isles, which tlie autlior is niucli inclined to describe as a new species, 
has been already distinguished by Kindberg in his 'Monograph of, the 
genus Lepujanuvi' (p.
30 and f.
15) as Z.
uzorlcum.
In the list of Muscl and Ihpatlcae, Mr. Mitten has not confined himself 
to the Azores, but included the other Atlantic isles, Madeira and the 
Canaries.
His catalogue of Mosses amounts to 151, only forty-seven of 
which have been met with in the Azores ; Bartramla azorica seems to be 
the oidy species peculiar to these islands.
Of Ihpatlcce, sixty-eight 
species are known to occur in the Atlantic islands ; of these nineteen are 
enumerated as Azorean, and two Gymnomil rlum erythrorhlzum and liha- 
cotheca azorica, are supposed to be peculiar to that flora.

graphy of the Azores, useful adjuncts to a ' Natural History.'

A Manual of Botany : incliuUng the Structure, Functions, Classification, 
Properties, and Uses of Plants.
By Robekt Bentley, F.L.S., 
M.li.C.S.E. Second Edition.
London : Churchill.
1870.
Pp. 832.
Professor Bentley's ' Mannal' beloiiijs to a well-known series of text- 
books for the medical schools, many of which have obtained a more than 
professional popularity.
The conditions of their publication imply a some- 
what conveulionMl treatment of their subjects ; and while anything like origi- 
nality is therefore hardly to be expected in the present case, as indeed it 
would be scarcely appreciated, it would yet be difficult to name any existing 
treatise, which contains, in so compendious a form, an equivalent mass of 
information.
Indeed, if the book were to be criticized quite abstractedly 
upon its own merits, it might be objected that it contained too much, and 
that the wealth of illustration and exposition of often almost purely hypothe- 
tical terms, applicable only to Phanerogams, might be desirably exchanged 
for a fuller account of Cryptogams.
Take for example the Fungi ; all t he in- 
formation given about them is compressed into some seven pages, while the 
mere terminology of Phanerogamic fruits alone occupies thirty.
One 
sighs to turn over the old familiar useless story about Clalbnliis and Tryma, 
Nuculaniuiu and Diploti'ijin , Syconus and Sorosis, to find at the end, as a 
reward for one's pains, that of such names " in practice, only a few are in 
common use." The statement that "the diseases known as blight, mil- 
dew, rust, smut, vine-mildew, potato-disease, ergot, etc., are either caused 
from, or accelei"ated by, the agency of Pungi " (p.
721), is, in contrast 
with this, a more condensed than useful account of some of the most ter- 
rible scourges of humanity.
A great deal is known of the part played by 
Fungi in causing these maladies, and of the measures which are more or 
less remedial of them, but of these nothing is stated.
Yeast, by the way, 
is not very correctly supposed to be " a mycelial state, composed of coni- 
dial cells of a species of Penicillium" and no mention is made, in connec- 
tion with it, of Bacteria , nor is there any account of the curious history 
of jEcidiam Berberidis, or, except a passing allusion, of De Bary's Alyce- 
tozoa.
Such things, however, are not required for examinations, the 
nomenclature of fruits possibly may be.
Yet, in this matter, we must not forget that the exigencies of a text- 
book adapted to the present requirements of students, have deprived Pro- 
fessor Bentley of miuli room to exercise his own judgment.
We cannot 
expect philosophically-arranged text-books till we get students who are 
willing to work at the botanical sides of biology for its own sake alone.
The subject-matter is arranged after the usual fashion in English books ; 
the so-called structural, systematic, and physiological divisions follow in 
successive order.
Such an arrangement does tolerably well for Phanero- 
gams, but breaks down miserably for all other plants, so that nowhere in 
the book do we get a connected account of any Cryptoganiic class ; but, in 
trying to follow it out, are sent on no particularly hxed principle fiom one

division to anotlier.
As we meet with more lowly differentiated types, it 
becomes, in fact, more and more impossible to discuss properly, apart 
from each other, structure aiul function.
The introductory remarks deal with the distinctions between plants 
and animals.
First and foremost is, of course, their fundamental reUition 
to the inorganic world.
The most philosophical plan is to show how all 
other differences can be made to How from this one.
Too much stress is 
perliaps laid on the absence of nitrogen from the permanent parts of 
plants ; they are as incapable as animals of existing without it, and, in- 
deed, it is obvious that if they were devoid of nitrogen, animals must be 
so also, as all animal nitrogen is derived ultimately from the plant world.
Tiie greater proportion of nitrogen required by animals seems to depend 
on their greater activity.
There is no activity without chemical change in 
the tissues of the living organism, and as all organic nitrogenous com- 
pounds are unstable, it is not unreasonable, with Mr. Herbert Spencer, to 
correlate the mutability of these compounds with the presence of nitrogen.
Plants are in the main passive, not active ; hence the presence of any 
large proportion of nitrogen in them would be useless.
As we descend 
in the animal world, we are not surprised to find indications of plant 
peculiarities ; hence, in some Molluscoida, we have a substance not very 
different from cellulose, and fiually, in the Racliolaria, actual starch, indis- 
tinguishable from that of vegetable origin.* 
It seems to be an accepted principle to restrict botanical text-books to 
recent plants, and to say as little as possible about fossil botany.
In the 
present volume the subject is altogether omitted.
This seems a matter 
for regret, because in the case of any particular group, the great end in 
view should always be to reach the most generalized conception of its 
structure, and fossil plants may supply in part or even wholly the key to 
this.
There is a general impression, for example, that acrogenous plants 
only grow at their summits ; yet the gradual elongation of the leaf-scars 
and their separation from one another as we proceed from the newer to 
the older parts of the stem, prove that in the Lepidodeiidrons, as in 
existing tree-ferns, growth never absolutely ceased in a longitudinal di- 
rection at any part of the axis ; again, in Lepldudendron, the vascular 
tissue of the stem was not at first produced to its full extent, but was 
continually added to from a Cambium layer, an arrangement of which, 
among allied plants, hoeles is the only existing representative.
No ac- 
count, however, of the little-noticed structure of the corm of this cru-ious 
plant is to be found in the present volume.
The necessity, in any really- 
general study of morphology, of taking into account both existing and 
recent types of plants, is well illustrated by the structure of Beuneliitfs, a 
genus of fossil Cycndere, which has been shown by Mr. Carruthersf to be- 
long to an entirely new group of the Order, standing to some extent in the 
same relation to other Cycads that Taxns does to other Coniferce.
Besides 
the possession of a trunk ovoid in outline, the woody cylinder is pierced 
by large meshes for the passage of the whole of the fibro-vasrular buiulles 
j)assing to each leaf, — an arrangement which can only find its parfllel in 
the caudex of tree-ferns In all other Cycads a number of small bundles 
perforate the woody cylinder separately to pass collectively into each 
petiole ; and here, it must be observed, that in describing the structure

of the stem of arboroseent Ferns, Professor Bentley, <ns seems to be 
generally the case with English writers, lias missed the significance of 
the openings in the vascular cylinder, which are not at all for the purpose 
of the conimunication of the cortical and medullary parenchyma, but are 
in reality the organic bases of the leaves.
This was pointed out by Mohl, 
and has also been independently ascertained by ^Ir. Carruthers.
It nnist 
inevitably soon be impossible to study apart the existing and extinct types 
of organized structures ; it would be a philosophical proceeding to antici- 
))ate what cannot be long delayed.
The pages of this ' ]\Ianual ' are profusely supplied with beautiful illus- 
trations, in a large number of cases, it is true, common to this and other 
English text-books, and acknowledging a common parentage in the 
' Atlas ' of Le Maout.
A perusal of the part dtvvoted to organography is 
much facilitated by their aid.
Perhaps more might be done, as witii tlie 
fruits mentioned above, in omitting detail and describing structures in 
more general language.
Under the head, for example, of "aerial modifi- 
cations of stems," we have the runner, offnet, slolou, sucker, and rhizome, 
from which the sobules is sepnrated as a " subterranean modification;" of 
these the runner and offset on the one hand, and the sucker, rhizome, and 
soboles on the other, have nothing essential that distinguishes them, 
while the stolon, as defined here, is more a habit than a structure ; yet so 
purely is the whole t-hiiig a matter of theory, that further on, under tlie 
head of roots, we have a whole page occupied, somewhat apologetically, it 
is true, with the rhizomes of Scabiosa succisa and Poli///ouuni Bislorla.
A special excellence belongs to the systematic portion, especially in the 
econouiic details, — a hunt through these shows how very carefully this 
part of the subject has been worked up, indeed, for purposes of re- 
ference, it will be found almost indispensable in these malters to possess 
the ' Manual.' The sequence of the Orders is mainly Candollean, with 
apparently nothing borrowed from the labours of Hooker and Bentham.
Something might have been done to indicate by difference of type the more 
important Orders, and seven pages devoted to an exposition of Linnsean 
classification are utterly wasted.
The physiology has been revised by Dr. Trimen, but a space so limited 
as eighty pages must have made it difficult to do more than scanty justice 
to this important but, in this country, little-studied side of botany.
Ee- 
cent researches have, however, by no means been overlooked, and we have 
brief notices of the histological nomenclature of Dr. Beale, Mr. Spencer's 
views on the movements of sap, clind)ing plants as stiulied by Darwin, 
etc.
It is satisfactory also to notice that points stated in earlier pages 
somewhat too absolutely, are here often modified.
Tliis is the case with 
the account given of germination (p.
789).
As a matter of fact, though 
contrary to what is said in books, it is almost impossible to lay down any 
criterion for distinguishing the germination of Monocotyledons and Dicoty- 
ledons which does not in some case or other break down.
The statements 
nuide in the former edition as to the prolonged vitality of seeds have beeu 
altered ; the case of Nelumbium, from fSir Hans Sloane's herbarium, is 
probably one of the best authenticated, but it wdl still tax the credulity 
of many readers to see that it is thought possible that seeds deposited 
when tiie valley of the Tweed was a lake, would gernuuate now.
To 
some persons the existence of batrachians, contemporary with a carboni- 
ferous flora, yet still living in coal mines, is not incredible ; in fact, a

well-voiicbed-for specimen was shown iu sllu at tlie last International Ex- 
hibition in London, — among such the Tweed valley seeds may find be- 
lievers.
It would be unfair to criticize, in detail, so carefully condensed 
a summary, and with two remarks we nuiy take our leave of a very useful 
book.
The first is, that a little stronger ground might have been taken 
(p.
751) as to the assimilation by plants of uncombined nitrogen.
Any 
chemist knows how all but impossible it is that this could happen, and 
amongst modern workers, the experiments of Lawes and Gdbert may be 
accepted as conclusive even against those of M.
Yille.
Lastly, the old 
belief that the temperature of trees exposed to great heat, is lower than 
that of the surrounding air, is no longer justified, as the careful experi- 
ments of Becquerel* show that the reverse is really the case, there being 
at least as much as 1° Centigrade difference.

F. Hance.
The 
author had previously pointed out that Q.
moiicjollca, Fisch., was the Oak 
on which the silkworm larva of the north of Cliina chiefly fed.
He now 
showed that Q.
serrata, of Thuuberg, is another silkworm-rearing species.
Also " On the Sources of the Radix Gulungce mhioris of Pharmacologists," 
by the same.
The source of the lesser Galaiigal has long been doubtful.
Dr. Hance, during an ex[)edition to the north coast of Haenan, found the 
dried roots exposed to the sun in baskets, and in the same district the plant 
itself was seen in cultivation, and subsequently discovered growing wild.
It is a species of Al/jbiia, not A.
chlneaah as has been supposed, but a 
species closely allied to A.
culcarata.
Rose.
Dr. Hance believes it to be 
undescribed, and he has named it A.
officbiarum.
It seems probable that 
its fruit is the " bilter-seedcd Cardamom," figured by Mr. Hanbury in 
riiarni.

are apparently 10 stamens alternating with 10 glands ; Dr. Masters con- 
siders the glands opposite the sepals to be barren stamens, and the re- 
mainder to constitute 5 compound stamens (opposite the petals), each 
compound stamen consisting of a central gland, and on either side of this 
a stamen.

The following communications were 
read : — " Note on the Practical Application of Meteorology to the Im-

Buchan.
In the ' Journal of the Scottish 
Meteorological Society' for April, 1870, there appeared a valuable paper 
by Mr. D.
Milne Howe, Chairman of the Covmcil of the Meteorological 
Society, on " Suggestions for Increasing the Supply of Spring Water at 
Malta, and improving its Climate," in which the author shows that plan- 
tations would increase the water supply of the island, and ameliorate its 
climate.
The drawbacks to the climate of Malta are chiefly these: — 
During winter and spring the island is swept by cold northerly winds ; 
during the summer mouths the heat is excessive, and during all seasons 
there is great scarcity of water.
These climatic peculiarities, which are 
very deleterious to health and vegetation, may be regarded as primarily 
arising out of the geographical position of Malta.
The winter tempera- 
ture rapidly falls in proceeding from Malta towards the north-east ; thus 
while at Malta the mean temperature of January is 56"0°; at Corfu it is 
49 8°; at Belgrade 30-3°; at Kiew 20'4°; and at Moscow 12-4°.
Hence

nortlierly winds at Malta are peculiarly characterized by excessive cold 
and dryness.
On the other hand, its proximity to Africa exposes it in 
summer to scorching- blasts of heated air.
These drawbacks are felt in 
tlieir fullest extent, owing to the almost complete absence of trees on 
tlie island.
The influence of forests on climate has been made a subject 
of investigation by meteorologists of late years, and though much still 
remains to be done, yet some important points have been established.
The highest temperature of the air occurs in summer between two and 
three p.m., but trees do not attain their highest temperature till 
nine p.m. Changes of temperature take place slowly in tlie tree, but in 
the air they are rapid.
Hence trees may be regarded, like the ocean, as 
powerful equalizers of temperature, in moderating the heat of the day, and 
in maintaining a higher temperature during tlie night.
Since air is heated 
by contact with the soil, and since trees shield the soil from solar radia- 
tion, it is evident that trees diminish the force of the sun's rays, especially 
in the lower stratum of the atmosphere, which is breathed by man.
Trees 
exhale moisture, and thus produce cold in the air by the latent heat ab- 
stracted from it.
From this lowering of the temperature, and from the 
moisture which is exhaled, dry winds acquire greater relative humidity, 
and thus are deprived of much of their noxious influence; and since trees 
break the force of the wind, their beneficial influence is greatly augmented.
During night the process of terrestrial radiation lowers the temperature of 
a tree at a slow rate.
First the upper leaves are cooled, then tliose leaves 
immediately under, and so on, until the whole are cooled.
Nov\^ in the 
earlier part of the day, before the tree is heated by the sun, its cool leaves 
present a very large surface to the air currents which pass through them.
Hence tlie cooling influence of trees is very considerable, which all must 
have experienced in the deliciously cool breezes of well-planted parks on 
a warm summer day.
This refrigerating influence of trees is sometimes 
well seen in the earlier part of the day, when the air is filled with fog.
In such cases heavy drops of water fall from the trees and increase, on 
occasions, to the copiousness of a heavy shower; and, doubtless, when 
the air is saturated, the rainfall will be heavier when the wind advances 
on a forest, whose temperature is several degrees lower than that of the 
surrounding district, where there are no trees.
Hence, then, it may fairly 
be inferred, if it has not been indeed proved, that trees bring about a 
different distribution of the rainfall, as respects the time of the day and 
tiie season of the year.
Trees serve another important use.
When rain 
falls on so dry and bare a soil as that of Malta, it runs ott" at once, and is 
lost in useless, if not destructive floods.
But since the roots of trees 
penetrate the soil, and so loosen it, and render it porous, much of the ram 
is not only received and preserved by the trees, but what falls tq the 
ground is allowed to sink into the soil, and fill the reservoirs of the deep- 
seated springs.
And since, owing to the stillness and greater dampness 
of the air among trees, the evaporation from forest soil is oidy about a 
fifth of what it is in an open country, woods ngulate the flow, and retard, 
if they do not altogether prevent the drying up of springs.

"Memoranda on Fir-cones chiefly in the Museum of Economic Botany,

Dickson, Glasgow.
Dr.
Dickson demonstrated some of the forms of spirals occurnng in the 
cones of the Spruce Fir {/Jbies exceha) by means of specimens where the 
cone-scales were nund)creil with oil-paint, different colours being used 
where desirable.
The paint was allowed to dry, and then the cones were 
put up in jars with strong solution of salt.
In this way he exhibited the 
following forms : — ^V spiral (the normal form) ; -^ spiral ; -^-^ spiral ; 
and conjugate double (bijagate) -JL—{=-^^) spiral.* Dr. Dickson stated 
that while working at these cones he took occasion (by permission of 
Professor Ballbur) to examine the collection of cones in the museum at 
the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, among which he noted the following :

The Trustees of the Britisli Museum have appointed Mr. William

Mr. J.
J. Bennett, who recently retired.
None of the readers of this 
Journal require to be informed of the very valuable additions to onr 
knowledge of plant structure which have been made by Mr. Carruthers ; 
many of his researches on fossil plants have been first published in our 
pages, and the yearly indexes show other important contributions from 
his pen.
With the prospect of increased accommodation in the new 
Natural History Museum, abundance of opportunity for developing the 
great resources of the department will be afforded to ]\Ir. Carruthers and 
his assistants.
Mr. Baker has commenced in the ' Gardener's Chronicle ' a synopsis of 
the genus Lilium.
He separates as a subgenus {Notholirion) the Hima- 
layan L.

Ilookeri describes another 
species of the same subgenus from Sikkim.
Under the title ' Bristol Pharmacology,' Mr. Stoddart, of Bristol, is 
publishing in the ' Pharmaceutical Journal ' a series of very interesting 
notes on the medicinal native plants growing round that city, which are 
very well worth perusal by students of our flora.
Dr. Asa Gray has recently given us a reconstruction of the Order Dia- 
pensiacece.
He associates with Biapensia and Pyxidanthera in this small 
Order Shortia and Galax, which have been referred to various natural fami-

We are also indebted to him for an excellent revision of the Polemo-

Miquel, Professor of Botany in the University of Utrecht, and Curator of 
the Royal Herbarium at Levden, succumbed to an affection of the chest 
in the end of last January.
He ranked among the most distinguished 
botanists of Europe, and the great advantages of the Leyden Herbarium 
were turned to excellent account by him in the elucidation of the botany 
of the East Indian Islands, Japan, and New Holland.
The ' Annales Musei 
Botanici Lugduno-Batavi,' commenced in lS'i3,and published in folio parts, 
of which forty, forming lour volumes, have appeared, and the ' Flora Indiae 
BataviB ' are his most important works; but Professor Miquel was the 
author of Monographs of the Pipcracn-e, Ctjcadets, Ficus, Cacti, Cos/ia- 
rina, etc., and of very numerous papers in tlie transactions of the learned 
societies of the Continent, no less than lOS articles standing under his 
name in the Royal Society's Catalogue.
By his death science loses an 
eminent votary, and the botanists of this and other lauds a fellow-worker 
who was always ready to place the information wdiich he possessed at 
their service.

P'ranz Lagger, of Freiburg, who paid much attention to the flora 
of Switzerland, and added a i'tw species to it, died in the early part of the 
year.
Eugene Coemans died at Ghent in January last.
He was a lay abbot, 
but devoted himself to botanical studies.
His earliest memoir was on 
some critical Belgian Cryptogams, published in 1858; and for several 
years he directed his attention to these plants, especially to the Fungi, 
and published several systematic and structural pipers on that Order.
More recently he became engrossed with the elucidation of the fossil 
plants of Belgium, and contributed several valuable papers to difl'erent 
periodicals, besides accumulating an extensive series of notes and draw- 
ings for a general work on the subject.
These he has left to the Natural 
History jMuscum of Belgium.
The most important of his papers is the 
description of a singular gymnospermous flora of Oetaceous age at 
Hainault, which was noticed in this Journal (Vol. V.
p. 182).
His 
memoirs on the genera Sp/ienop//i/llnm, Jininhiri/i, and Aderopltyllites, 
cleared up the confusion into which these forms of foliage had got; and, 
although at flrst he hehl them to be most probably phanerogamous plants, 
he subsequently adopted the views of Air. Carruthers, and in our pages 
published (Vol. VII.
p. 337) his estimate of the classification and rela- 
tion of those forms.
His death is a great loss to science, especially to 
science in Belgium.
We also regret to record the death, in his forty-second year, of Mr.
T. W.
Gissing, which took place at Wakefield ou December 28.
Mr.

This form, or one closely related to it, occurs in England, and 
also in the south of France.
Resembles circinatus by its distant and 
rigid leaves with regular outline, but differs from it by its shorter pe- 
duncles, and by the lateral position of the leaves, not surrounding the 
stem.
It also approaches tricliopJiyllm, between which and circinatus it is 
intermediate.

cially by its hairy not glabrescent fruit receptacle.
It differs from penicil- 
latits, from which Mr. Syme and Professor Babington have not distin- 
guished it, by the absence of floating leaves, and usually by a different

Tlie ultimate co-ordinate forms recognized in the previous notes must 
not be considered as generally equivalent to sub-species; in many cases, 
at least, their characters depend upon purely external or accidental causes 
and the plants are not genetically distinct.
Thus the peculiarity of the 
form cgespitosus is manifestly due to the dryness of its habitat, whilst the 
differences between several forms with ttoating leaves and the correspond- 
ing ones without tioating leaves are not likely to be of even sub-si)ecitic 
value.
On the other hand, some forms retain their characters throusjh 
very diverse circun)stances, and they can, for many purposes, be regarded 
as true species; indeed, it is only by taking a wide and comprehensive 
view of the group in general, or by comparing some cases of approach on.
the part of others that certain of the forms would appear at all likely to 
belong to the same aggregate species.
Some little has been done by 
growiiig the plants from seed towards showing that certain forms are 
possibly derived from others ; but nnu;h more is required to prove that 
all the forms can be so altered by cultivation or otherwise ; and moreover, 
it is quite likely that no amount of cultivation or manipulation could, in 
any reasonable time, complete the proof that all the forms are interchange- 
able by descent.
\Vilh the object of clearing up many doubts, it is very 
desirable that further experiments should be made to test their capacity 
for variation due to age, climate, season, kind of water and strength of 
current, descent, and other circumstances ; that more specimens should be 
brought from those parts of the world that at present have yielded few 
and isolated forms ; and that, whenever any person meets with a state 
ditterent from the well-known forms, specimens should be forwarded to 
some botanist who is well acquainted with the plants and takes a special 
interest in them.
For complete synonymy the ante-Linnean names should be quoted ; 
but as these consist in many cases of long phrases, and have quite 
dropped out of common use, it has been thought better not to encumber 
these notes with so much extra matter as the bare enumeration of them 
would involve, and that for so little practical utility.
It is interesting, 
however, to know that the old botanists, from the time of Dioscorides 
downwards, recognized and named several of the forms ; indeed, about 
seventy- five ante-Linnean names are extant.
They relate to what have 
latterly been called R.
hederaceiis, L., R.
aqnatUis, L., R.
heterophylliis, 
Web., R.
pdtatus, Schrank, R.fwniculaceus, Gilib., R.
pectinatus, Dubois, 
R. paHcistamineus, Tausch, and to the forms heder(pfolms, homoiopliyUus, 
fiorlbundm, circinatm, trichophyllus ^\\(\ fiuitans of this enumeration.
The floating leaves in the hederaceus and heterophyllus groups, when 
developed under favourable circumstances, have in many cases curved out- 
lines of much beauty and regularity ; it is thus seen that such curves 
obviously obey definite and exact laws, and inquiry is naturally suggested 
into their nature.
The following results arc taken from a paper read by me on March 13th, 
FORMS AND DISTRIBUTION OF BATRACHIUM.
107 
1871, before the Cambridge Philosophical Society : — Consider the curved 
margin of an undivided portion of a leaf which floats in a stream exposed 
to the resistance of the current ; suppose that the power of growth is 
exerted equally at all points of the margin, and tends to push the margin 
normally outwards, so as to oppose rather than co-operate with the cur- 
rent, and is just balanced at the instant considered by the other mechanical 
forces which act on the margin ; and further suppose that the margin 
remains as a flexible curve with tangential tension, but not sul)mitted to 
either normal strains or wcenching couples.
It then follows, from merely 
mechanical reasons, that the tangential tension is the same at all points, 
and that the form of the portion of the margin at the instant under con- 
sideration is determined by one of the following intrinsic equations : — 
(^ycosajn 
tan I -r cos a f zz cos o tan (p, or e 
2s.cotj3 
I sin (3 -f .
sin (3 ~ (p) 
according as the vigour of growth is more or less than sulRcient to over- 
power the direct resistance of the current.
In these equations * represents the length of the arc of the margin 
measured from that point of it where its tangent is in tlie direction of the 
current to the point where the tangent makes the angle </> with that 
direction ; and I and a or /3 are quantities dependent only upon the pro- 
portional values of the tangential tension, the power of growth and the 
direct resistance of the current.
It readily follows from these equations that the curvature of the mar- 
gins, at those points where the tangent makes a small angle with the 
direction of the current, is greater than at those points where the tangent 
makes a larger angle.
After the leaf-margin ceases to be flexible, as, for 
instance, after the completion of its growth, the investigation can be 
extended to calculate the tangential tensions, the normal strains and the 
wrencliing couples, to which it is then submitted at different points of the 
margin, and tolerably simple expressions are found for them.
The first 
equation when traced furnishes a series of separate ovals (but not ellipses), 
the longest diameters of which all lie on one straight line, perpendicular 
to the direction of the current ; the second equation furnishes a pair of 
catenary-like curves, with their convexities opposed to each other, which 
become actual catenaries when the power of growth would just balance 
the direct resistance of the current.
Parts only of these curves are ap- 
plicable to the hypothesis ; and in no case are those parts applicable which 
correspond to points where tfy lies between 180° and 360°.
When the leaves are divided, as is frequently the case, each lobe must 
be treated to a separate calculation ; and when the margins are exposed 
to violent strains or abnormal mechanical conditions, growth is pro- 
bably checked and the leaves tend to retain their form by the support 
of their interior, but new lobes may be produced at those points where 
the tendency to break, as determined by the method above indicated, is a 
maximum.

Valves of the spathe lanceolate, scariose, reaching the base of the limb at 
the flowering time.
Ovary sessile.

oblanceolate-oblong, 5-6 lines broad ; inner divisions linear, about half 
an inch long, spreading between the outer ones as in the other species.
Stigmas with the crest as long as the outer divisions, 4-5 lines broad at 
the base of the limb.
Hab. Syria, Aucher-Eloy, 2137 !
I have seen only three dried specimens of this ; but it seems a very 
well-marked plant, combining the habit and flower of caucasicum with 
the leaves of alatum.
SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
Vegetable Broom-materials.
— As supplementary to Prof.
Dyer's 
notes (p.
51) the stalks oF the common garden Cress {Lepidium sativum) 
may be added.
In Russia they are used for this purpose, and a small 
broom brought home by Dr. Hooker on his return from Russia is now 
in the Museum at Kew. The stalks are stiff and strong ; and judging 
from the above specimen, they appear quite suitable for broom making.
The stems of Tamarix (jallica have also been used for a similar purpose.

Plants of Co. Cork.
— Brosera anyllca.
— I found this sparingly in a 
new station, Bluefort Bog, Newmarket, in the north-west of the county, 
in the summer of 1870.
The ' Cybele' states it as hitherto only recorded 
from the west ; indeed, apparently only from a point so far west as 
Berehaven.
On the same bog very sparingly grew Carex Umosa, not yet 
recorded from this county.
Ranunculus heterophyllus, Bab., for which 
only a few stations in tlie extreme north of Ireland are given in the 
Cybele Hib., is not uncommon in this neighbourhood.
I gathered it 
abundantly last summer.
TrifoHnni scahrum is stated to be very rare, and 
to occur only in one or two of our midland connties.
(See Cyb. Hib.) 
Two or three years since I found it growing abundantly on sand-hills 
near Youghal, in this county.

Chlorophyll prodfced without Influence of Light (p.
1.5).
— 
The production of clilorophyll in plant-tissues removed from the influence 
of light h;>8 not escaped the attention of physiologists.
Sachs has discussed 
the matter (see Micheli's translation of his 'Physiologic Vegetale') ; al- 
though he considers that the virescence of the embryos of many plants is 
not really a case in point, since "the light penetrates through the walls 
of the carpel and the testa of the seed with sufficient energy to produce 
this result." He has, however, found that the embryos of Pinus Pinea, 
P. canadensis, P.
Strobus, Thuja orientaUs become green even when every 
precaution is taken to keep them in obscurity, and that this is also the 
case with the fronds of Adiantnm CapUlus-Veneris^ Poly podium vulgare, 
Jspidiuni spinulosum, Scolopendrinm officinale, Pteris chnjsocarpa.
He 
thinks that in cases like these there may be a substance capable of acting 
on the protoplasm with the same effect as light.
He finds reason for 
thinking this Hkely, from the production of a green colour when etiolated 
chlorophyll is heated with fuming sulphuric acid.

Economic Applications of Cyperus longus, Z.
— In Ansted's 
'Channel Islands,' p.
517, it is stated that the material named Han " is 
derived from the fibre of the Cyperus lonyus, manufactured like hemp.
It 
is used instead of rope for many purposes, and is preferred to hemp, inas- 
much as it does not readily harden, or become coated with slimy weed, 
when exposed to the action of salt water.
Mats, footstools, saddles, 
horse-collars, shackles for cattle, etc., are made from it, as well as boat- 
rope, and rope for various fishing purposes." On page 180, the manu- 
facture is spoken of as confined to Guernsey; and when in the island last 
year I made inquiries about it, but without much success.
After some 
search I heard that native-made saddles and mats were occasionally 
brought into S.
Peter Port from the distant parts of the island.
I 
secured one of the saddles, which is a packsaddle used for bringing up the 
vi-aic or wrack from the shore.
It is now in the Economic Museum of 
112 SHORT NOTES AND ftUERlES.
Kew. The main part of the saddle is simply made of the plaited stems 
of Scirpus Tabei'Hcemontani.
The inside is partly lined with Cyperusloiigus, 
but in its natural state merely dried ; nor could I ascertain that any of 
the fibre as described by Prof.
Ansted was manufactured.
The ordinary 
rope used in the island is made of coir or jute.
I noticed that bands of 
the Ci/perus were used in tying up sheaves of barley, instead of, as cus- 
tomary in England, a band of the same plant as the sheaf.

Fertilization.
— We very much want a term to express the falling of 
the pollen on the stigma (the German Bestdubung') .
In ordinary text- 
books no distinction is drawn between this and fertilization ; but Darwin 
and Hildebrand have clearly shown that frequently when the stigma is 
be-poUened from its own stamens (Selbst Bestaubung), the pollen is still 
carried to other flowers by insects, so that cross-fertilization takes place.
Can any of your readers suggest a better term than " poUenization " ?
— 
A. W.
Bennett.
Perianth (p.
54).
— I am glad Mr. Grindon has called attention to 
this term ; it has always seemed to me a wholly useless (and therefore 
undesirable) one, and one that ought to be abolished.
Why should we not 
speak of the calyx and corolla of a tulip or iris as much as of a water-lily ?
We are told that there is no organic distinction between calyx and corolla, 
and that they can only be distinguished by their position.
If so Rmnex 
and Polygonum are distinctly di-chlamydeous, possessed of a true calyx 
and corolla.

The True Tetraspores of Seirospora Grifftthsiana.
— In 
1862 I received from Miss Dyke Poore S.
Grijifhsiana, from Jersey, with 
what appeared to me tetrasporic fruit.
I sent the plant to the late Pro- 
fessor Walker Ariiott, of Glasgow, who confirmed my opinion.
The te- 
traspores occurred in pairs or singly on short pedicels, very diftereut to 
the necklace-like hardened bodies termed ' seirospores,' produced usually on 
this plant at the extremities of the raniuli.
According to Agardh, these 
bodies likewise occur in the genus CaUiihamnion.
I believe the true 
tetraspores of Seirospora have been observed by Agardh, but 1 have seen 
no notice of their occurieuce on British specimens, nor have I ever seen 
them on any but these Jersey plants.
If seirospores are also produced in 
the genus Callithamnion, there seems no reason why Seirospora should 
not be replaced in that genus from which it was removed on account of 
these bead-like seirospores, which were supposed to be restricted to this 
species alone.
I would recommend algologists during the approaching 
season to carefully examine all specimens of Seirospora Griffithsiana m 
search of the tetraspores.

Plants of the Site of the Exhibition of 1862.
— Since the 
building in which the International Exhibition of 1862 was held was 
pulled down, the site has remained weed-covered and unoccupied.
From 
time to time I have visited the ground, and have almost on every occasion 
found some new and interesting plant which I had not seen there before.
The plants at first found were mostly annuals, which grow rapidly, and can- 
not tolerate consolidated soil, and, moreover, only precariously ripen their 
seed.
Afterwards perennials, represented at first possibly by only a few 
unnoticed individuals, increased and took the place of the departed 
annuals.
The year 1870 was the last opportunity of collecting these, 
as they will soon be extinguished by the new Natural History Museum.
Of a 'list published in the fourth volume of the ' Journal of Botany,' 
p. 151, only Artemisia scoparia, W.
and K., Carduus arverisis, Curt.
var.
setosus and' (E/toi/tera biennis, L., occurred in 1870, — all of them, however, 
abundantly.
Fhysalis Alkeken(ji, L., recorded in last list, was an error for 
the not dissimihir Nicandra phjsaloides, Gaertn.
(See PI.
Middx.
p. 195.) 
The International Horticultural Exhibition in 1866 probably introduced 
some additional species.
Up to 1869 these are noted in the 'Middlesex 
Flora.' In 1870 I met with the following plants, which are not given in 
the Flora for this locality.
Saponaria officinalis, L., Epilotnum angnsti- 
foliim, vi\v.d7ac/ti/carpiim,Le\<j:\\i., Rumex a/pinns,h., were, like Oenothera 
biennis, L., doubtless tlie remains of old garden cultivation reasserting 
themselves.
This may also have been the case with Kitaibelia vitifolia, W ., 
a plant peculiar to Hungary, which may, nevertheless, have been intro- 
duced along with Jrteminia scoparia, VV.
and K.
; also a plant of south- 
eastern Europe.
If the Artemisia could establish any footing beyond the 
Exhibition ground, which is likely enough to happen if earth has to be 
removed for the foundations of the new Museum, it would certainly become 
a permanent addition to our Loudon fiora.
The remaining plants were

Tlie others are not named, but suggestions are given

near Falkirk, specimens oi Antholithes Pltcairniee with its fruit Cardiocar- 
pon.
The latter had never before been ibund attached.
Calamites nodoms 
was found in great abundance, but very fragmentary ; neveitheless, he had 
been able to make a restoration of the whole plant.
Two or three other 
species of Calamites were associated with it, but not in a good state for 
determination.
The leaves oi Flahellaria borassifolia were abundant, and 
he was fortunate to find also a couple of specimens of the woody stem of 
the plant.
Many Ferns were also met with, and a llalonia, showing leaf- 
scars and bud-like prominences arranged in a spiral manner on it, ditter-

" On Carex 
Jiam, L., and its allies, of the Manchester Flora," by Charles Bailey ; 
illustrated by a large suite of specimens.
The prevailing form in the 
district, and one very common to the south of Manchester, is the Carex 
lepidocarpa, Tausch.
; this is the C.
(Ederi, Sm., and of Grindon's ' Man- 
chester Flora,' and the C.
flava, var.
/3 of ' Buxton's Guide.' The true 
C. flava (a.
gtnnbia, E.B.), as stated long ago by Mr. Buxton, is nowhere 
met with in the district.
Specimens of G.
(Ederi, Ehrh., from Mere 
Mere, the locality mentioned in Buxton's 'Botanical Guide,' were re- 
cently exhibited at a meeting of the Society, and the sandhills at South- 
port are, so far as I know, the only other locality in the neighbourhood 
for this species.
There is some confusion in the nomenclature of the 
group, and the characters given in our standard authority — ' English 
Botany,' 3rd edition — do not altogether dispel it.
In that work, Dr.
Syme describes C eu-fava, ^.
lepidocarpa, as usually having the male 
spikes sessile or subsessile, and the female spikes as being all approxi- 
mate, or the lowest a little remote when its stalk is said to be wholly in- 
cluded within the sheath.
The Manchester plant, however, lias the male 
spike stalked, the peduncles being often of great length, while the female 
spikes are scarcely approximate, but rather scattered, and the lower spike 
is generally produced, its stalk being conspicuously exserted.
The fruits 
are more narrowed at the base than represented in ' English Botany,' and 
the bracts are very long, much exceeding the male S|uke.
There are two 
forms of C.
lepidocarpa, Tausch., in the district ; the more common one, 
which occurs in lields and open ground, has the leaves as long as or 
longer than the somewhat thick and rigid stems, but the latter are with- 
out the roughness at the summit described by Grenier and Godron in 
their ' Flore de France ; ' the fruit is slightly inflated, and the beak long 
but straight.
The single specimen which I possess of Billot's No. 2159 
(Fl. Gall, et Germ.
Exsicc.) closely approaches this form, but it is less 
rigid, and has only a single spike of fruits.
The other form, occurring in 
damp ground amongst long grass, is much taller and more slender than 
that just named; its stems exceed the leaves, and the fruit is less inflated, 
so as to be gradually attenuated into a beak.
Some plants of this form, 
which I collected at Oakmere, Chesliire, and at Whaley Bridge, Derby- 
shire, near the reservoir, agree very well with the plant issued in Wirtgen's 
Herb.

Billot's specimens of G.
flava, 
L., from the fosse of the citadel of Strasburg (n.
2158), quoted by 
Dr. Syme as synonymous with his var.
a. geiiuina, do not quite agree 
with any Scotch or north English plant which I have gathered or seen.
Dr. Syme describes the female spikes of genaina as not contiguous, but 
they are all contiguous in the Strasburg plant, while the leaves are

rather longer than the stems, and the lowest bract greatly exceeds the 
male spike, — the contrary being stated in ' English Botany ' to be the case.
It may be mentioned that Godron, in the Fl. de France, t.
iii.
p. 424, 
like Dr. Syme, divides C.
eu-flava into var.
a gemiina and /3.
lepidocarpa, 
the former having approximate, and tlie latter slightly scattered spikes, 
while the var.
a. gennina of ' English Botany ' has the spikes not con- 
tignous, and /3.
lepiducirpa all approximate.
The plants of the north of 
England which I have examined agree better with Godron's characters.
The figure of C.
CEderi, Elirh., given in 'English Botany,' plate 167+, 
very accurately represents the plants of Mere Mere and Southport, which 
also agree with Belgian specimens published in Van Heurck's ' Herbier 
des Plantes Rares ou Critiques,' n.
189.
But Dr. Syme quotes Billot's 
plant (Fl. Gall, et Germ.
Exsicc, n.
1352) as identical with this species, 
whereas the specimens in my set differ greatly from the ' English Botany' 
plate and description.
In Billot's plant the male spikes are on long 
stalks, while the female spikes are widely separated from each other, and 
are not as spreading as they are represeu ed in ' English Botany ; ' the 
fruits also differ in not being abruptly narrowed or inflated, and the beak, 
instead of being short and straight, as in the Manchester plants, is some- 
Avhat long and slightly recurved.
It is worth noticing, as bearing upon 
the specific distinctness of this plant, that M.
Crcpin, in his ' Manuel de 
la Flore de Belgique,' mentions that it is remarkable in its shoots, put- 
ting forth every year new tufts of leaves and new stems, which I under- 
stand to mean that fresh stems appear simultaneously with the new 
leaves, instead of the stems being produced from the tufts of the preceding 
season, as in most sedges.
— Mr. Sidebothara, who also exhibited a large 
series of each of the plants from various localities, gave it as his opinion 
that they w^ere three distinct species, not difficult to separate even in their 
extreme forms ; and he extended to all three the remark of Dr. B.
Syme, 
in the new edition of ' English Botany,' where he says, that although 
it might sometimes be difficult at first sight to distinguish the species, 
when a dried specimen only was seen, he had never found the least diffi- 
culty when the plants were growing.
The following short characters 
were, he thought, quite sufficient to separate the species from each other : 
— Carex pava ; fruit yellow, nuts large, beak very long, detlexed.
C. 
lepidocarpa ; fruit pale green or yellowish-green, nuts smaller and beak 
shorter than in C.
Jluva, beak straight.
C. (Ederi ; fruit pale yellow, 
nuts very much smaller than preceding, and more globular, beak very 
much shorter, straight.
He had never gathered C JIava in the Man- 
chester district, although abundant in the north of Lancashire ; O.
CEderi, 
he reported as occurring abundantly at Llaiuludno.

Micheli was the first to distinguish Scleroderma Geaster, Fr., iti his 
' Nova Genera Plantariim,' p.
219.
t. 99.
fig.
1, wliere he published it as 
a distinct species under tlie name of Lt/coperdastrnm rotundain majus.
After tliat it appears to have been passed over by botanical writers till 
Persoou took it up and designated the genus Scleroderma, from its hard 
integument ; his specific name for our plant, poli/rhizum, seems to have 
been less suitable, as it applies equally to others of the genus.
Fries, in his ' Systema Mycologicum,' iii.
46, named the species more 
appropriately S.
Geaater, on account of its resemblance to the plants of 
that genus.
In his monograph of the Ly coper dacece, Vittadini remarks 
that the species of Scleroderma are few, but so variable in character that 
they are only to be recognized after a long acquaintance.
The differences 
in the colour of their peridia, the size and form of the uterus, and the 
presence or absence of a stem, he considers of little moment, nor are those 
consisting in the colour of the flesh and spores nmch more reliable, for the 
same species exhibits these of various tints, according to differences of soil 
and atmosphere ; much depends on the slowness or rapidity of develop- 
ment, which are manifestly connected witli climate and temperature.
He 
places more reliance on a careful comparison of specimens from different 
localities, and collected under various atmospheric conditions, combined 
with careful microscopical study of the fructitication.
The greater num- 
ber of so-called species the Italian botanist refers to S.
vxlyare, F., S.
Geaater being the only other with which he is acquainted which he thinks 
worthy of specific rank.
He describes it as possessing a very thick peri- 
dium splitting at the apex in a stellate manner, with a smooth, somewhat 
silky or furfuraceous cortex, of a yellowish-grey colour.
The flesh black 
or brown-purple, and the spores olive-brown.
AHttadini describes two varieties, the first is emergent, sessile, globose, 
or transversely elongate ; flesh at first watery-white, then black, varie- 
gated with white walls.
The inner substance of the peridium, when re- 
cent, whilish-ytllow ; when dry, of a pale woody tint, rather corky; in the 
young condition, when dry, strongly plicato-rugose, with black flesh almost 
stony in consistence, shining when rubbed.
This is fretiuent near Mihin 
in oak- and pine-groves in autumn.
The second variety is developed be- 
neatii the soil, substipitate, pear-shaped, 2-5 inches across ; perulium 2-3 
lines thick, purplish-white within, clothed with scales n)ixed with sand, 
and of a permanent yellow colour, scarcely rugose when dry ; flesh at first 
watery-white, hard, at length of a dirty purple colour, soft, variegated 
with white flocci.
He adds that he long considered these varieties as dis- 
tinct species, relying on Fries, who thought their cliaracters permanent ; 
but afterwards, on seeing S.
Geaster in various localities and soils, he 
found that the one form evidently passed over into the other, the flesh 
assuming every tint between black and bluish-purple.
The species is distinguished from the rest of the genus by the singular

This species, of which the absence of ripe fruit on my specimen pre- 
cludes my giving a fuller diagnosis, is allied to L.
maritiiii/ts.
Big., and 
L. pisi/ormls, L., and is doubtless the unnamed plant alluded to in 
Maximowicz's ' Index Floras Pekinensis.' In referring it to the section 
Orobus, I understand that group as limited by Alex.
Braun and other 
recent writers.

The plant itself is quite scentless, but the fruit — fresh or dried, ripe or 
unripe — when cut across, exhales a powerful and most delicious odour, 
K 2 
132 SERTULTJM CHINENSE SEXTUM : 
precisely similar to that of candied citron peel.
By the prominent calyx- 
teeth and the fistular juga (which character, however, disappears in the 
ripe fruit) this ag-rees with the species separated by Hoffmann under the 
name of Odericum ; by its infrajugal vittse it, however, differs, I believe, 
from any Angelica hitherto described.
In young fruit the vittse are made 
out with tlie greatest difficulty, but in mature ones, after maceration, they 
are very conspicuous.
I think the increase in the number of these organs 
in the Chinese plant, taken in connection with the fact, as stated by Mr.
Bentham (Gen. Plant, i.
917), that in some species of Jrchangelica they 
cohere with the fruit rather than the seed, points to the advisableness of 
suppressing the latter genus.
The discovery of this plant is particularly interesting, as affording an- 
other instance of the extension of northern Asiatic forms to South China, 
to which I have already on several occasions directed the attention of 
botanists.
The genus Angelica (as comprehensively, and I believe natu- 
rally, characterized by Mr. Bentham) is, unless I err, entirely absent from 
southern Asia ; whilst, as compared with other umbelliferous genera, it is 
richly represented on the north-eastern Asiatic seaboard.
Excluding 
Archangelica (which, as mentioned above, I should prefer to unite), Maxi- 
mowicz and Kegel enumerate six species from Russian Manchuria, and 
the former author two — probably new ones — from the neighbourhood of 
Peking; whilst the island of Sachalin, not yet thoroughly explored, has, 
according to F.
Schmidt, four; not of course all different from those of 
the mainland.
Miquel records only three from Japan, but there can be 
little doubt this number will be augmented ; though, as Euprecht, in his 
' Revision der Umbelliferen aus Kamtschatka,' counts but two species 
from those regions ; Regel and Tiling two from Ayan in eastern Siberia ; 
and Trautvetter and Meyer only one from Ochotsk ; w^e can scarcely per- 
haps expect additions from the northern parts of the empire.

It is a matter for regret that the corolla of neither of these

Li the dilated bases of the petals this agrees with De Candolle's Eulo-

Jonrn.

author.
In inflorescence, except that the pedimcle is much longer, it re- 
sembles L.
memecylifoUus, W.

(belonging to quite another section), 
and would, I suppose, come under Oliver's § 20.
This mode of inflores- 
cence, usually described as umbellate, should rather be called cymose ; 
and, except tluit the flowers are pedicelled, is similar to that of the Xylos- 
teous LonicercE.
The flowers are usually two only, and the pedicels

This falls into Joh. Mueller's section Mappa ; but it does not agree 
apparently with any species described by him, and his subdivisions are 
purely artificial, and arranged solely to facilitate determination ; though 
the characters he relies on are by no means constant, as, for example, the 
relative length of limb and petiole.
Dr. Hooker has recently, in his 
edition of the late Professor Harvey's ' Genera of South African Plants,' 
restored the genus Mappa.
It seems to me, however, impossible to re- 
gard it as generically distinct from Macaranga, which in respect of priority 
is eighteen years older.
Mappa, moreover, is objectionable as a name, 
from its too great resemblance in sound to the Olacaceous genus MappUt.

North

Shanklin ; in Cowpit Clift' Wood, with pedicels quite glabrous an I smaller 
petals ; near Landguard Farm and near Great Combley Farm.
Well 
marked in the most typical form by the ten stamens, the long-reflected 
pedicels, and the large petals, which catch the eye even when the flower 
is closed ; but it must be confessed that plants often occur which it is 
difficult to refer to S.

holosteoides, Fries.
On the top of Shanklin

1858.
C. pnmilum, Curt.
Abundant on Bembridge Down, especially near the 
edge of the cliff, 1858; on Brading Down; Afton Down, Frediwater.
This plant is very different from both 6'.
semidecnndrnm and C.
triviale, 
but is very closely allied to C.
tetrandrum, to which it is indeed joined 
as a variety by Cosson and Germain.
Besides that the edge of the 
bract is membranous, the stems of C piiniilum branch in a more regular 
manner from about the middle, while in C.
tetrandrum the stems branch 
from quite low down, and tlie dichotomy is developed on one side only.
In the stiape and veining of the petals, C.
piimilum agrees closely with C.
tetrandrum, while both differ from C semidecandrum.
The plant iflen- 
tioned by Dr. Bromfield as growing near the Ferry House at St. Helen's 
is Q.
tetrandrum.
C. tetrandrum, Curt.
Occurs in a few places at some distance from the

KuBUs. Mr.
J. G.
Baker, during a short visit which he paid to the 
Isle of Wight in the summer of 1868, made a collection of all the forms 
which he saw, amounting to about fifty, and has kindly favoured me with 
the following notes : — 
Rnbus siiberectm, Anders.
Seen only once, but very characteristic as 
regards prickles, etc., in the Tinker's Dell, in Apse woods.
R. plicatus, W.
et N.
Plentiful in the marsh at Freshwater gate, and 
gathered also on Ningwood Common.
R. rliarnnifolim, W.
et N.
Several forms which Babington would 
include here.
Bloxam's typical rhnDuiifolius, with a small, long-stalked, 
finely-toothed, terminal leaflet, scarcely cordate at the base, in hedges, at 
Stapler's Heath, near Newport ; a larger, more cordate-leaved form, with 
the inflorescence scarcely more than racemose, near the same place ; a 
form quite agreeing with the common north country plant, which Bloxam 
and Warren call affinis, on Col well Heath ; and a plant with cordate leaves 
a good deal felted beneath, at Ningwood Common.
R. Lindleianus, Lees.
Satisfactory and typical, in the Tinker's Hole, 
at Apse, and at Stapler's Heath, near Newport.
R. coryUfoUns, Sm. Next to dmolor, apparently the commonest Bram- 
ble everywhere through the island.
R. Balfoirrianus, Blox.
I saw a plant which Babington places here in 
a hedge at Brading, and again in two or three places along the Underclift", 
west of Ventnor.
This is not exactly Bloxam's original Balfourianvs, 
and diff"ers from corylifolins, principally by the sepals adpressed to the 
fruit.
Genevier labels it " degeiier.'' 
R. discolor, W.
et N.
By far the commonest Bramble through the

isliiud, keeping- its characters well, as it does in Yorkshire, not running 
into other things (^leucostachys, mucrophyllus, etc.) as it does about Lon- 
don.
The universal Vectiau form is the common English one, R.
rmti- 
canus of E.
Mercier and Genevier.
R. c<esius, L.
Tolerably common, but not so much as it often is.
A 
remarkai)ly prickly form by the roadside at Norton, 
R. thyrsoidens, VVimm.
A form agreeing with the plant of Bloxam's 
fasciculi, on the commons at Colwell and Hampstead.
R. leucostachys, Sm. Everywhere common about Shanklin, but not 
seen along the tlndercliff, where, indeed, there is little else but discolor ; 
leucostachys gathered also in several places about Newport, and in a hedge 
midway between Yarmouth and Freshwater Gate, and a shade form in 
Beckett's Copse.
R. Salteri, Bab, The original place at x\pse woods, is a good station 
for studying this, as it runs up from the original Salteri into Bloxam's 
large strong caloatus.
I saw it also in several other places about Colwell, 
Calbourne, and Ningwood.
R. carpinifolim, W.
et N.
Just Bloxam's plant {lunhrosm, Arrh.), 
in the Calamintha syhatica dell, at Apes Down, 
R. macrophyltus, Weihe.
In a lane, near the stream just out of Cal- 
bourne, westward.
Bloxam's macrophyllus, which is Babington's only 
in part.
R. ritdis, Weihe.
Very characteristic, in the lane between Calbourne 
and the Apes Down farmhouse.
R. Sprengelii, Weihe, var.
Borreri.
Roadside, half a mile out of New- 
port towards Eyde.
R. fusco-ater, of Bloxam and Babington's last two editions.
Colwell 
Heath, sparingly.
R. nemoroHus, of Babington's earlier editions and Bloxam's fasciculus, 
including under this name the dlcersifulhis and tuhercidatus of Babing- 
ton's last edition ; it is common about Freshwater, Yarmouth, and Shal- 
fleet ; varying much in the quantity and strength of the prickles, and the 
stem either without hairs or with a considerable quantity.
R. rosacens, Weihe.
Hedge out of Newport or little westward, and fine 
in Beckett's Copse, near Freshwater.
Two common Brambles 1 did not 
see anywhere, were Radula and pallidas, the latter a universal wood 
Bramble wherever else in England I have been." 
\Jiosa Sablni, Woods.
Mr. J.
G. Baker has informed me that he saw a 
specimen labelled, as found in the Isle of Wight, in Mr. Watson's collection 
of British Roses, which was destroyed by the fire which also consumed the 
whole of Mr. Baker's own herbarium.
Possibly this may be identical 
with the plant mentioned by Bromfield as growing at Apse Heath.] 
R. tomenlosa, Sm. Bembridge, St. Helens, Combley Wood, Shanklin, 
etc.
; usually in small quantity, but abundant in many places near Gods- 
hill.
In a lane south of Calbourne (J.
G. Baker).

Satisfactorily wild, growing 
with R.
micrantha, in the lane along the foot of Westovcr Wood, near 
Caiburne (J.

I fear that this is always sown by birds or 
otherwise introduced.

CuUUriche liamnlata, Kiitz.
In a pool, at Staplers, near Newport (F.
Stratton).
This specimen has the narrow elongated lower leaves so cha- 
racteristic of the plant when growing in mountain lakes, but the upper 
leaves and fruit are precisely the same as in the Callitrlche which grows 
at Knigliton, and has leaves all short and nariowly obovate.
A barrtu form of C.
vernalis, with the leaves all linear, occurs in streams, 
and this, when cultivated, soon produces the obovate upper leaves charac- 
teristic of C.
vernalis.

All the three species, though seemingly wild in many dif- 
ferent localities, are, 1 suspect, like the Wild Apple, always the offspring 
of seeds scattered by birds or carried by streams from tlie parent shrubs 
so generally cultivated in gardens.

G. vero-moUngo.
In 1858, I gathered in a hedge 
on Ashey Down a few specimens intermediate between G.
Mollugo and 
G. verum.
The two specimens which I have preserved are diiferent 
from each other.
One, with broader and more pubescent leaves, shows 
more resemblance to G.
Molhxjo ; the other, with narrow leaves, is more 
like G.

close to the road passing through Calbourne Bottom.
The words " Belhan, 
pi.
I. W.," quoted by Dr. Bromficld from the ' Hampshire Repository,' 
are not necessarily intended for any locality, but should doubtless be read 
as referring to Relhan's Plate in his 'Flora Cantabrigiensis,' whiciris 
quoted by Garnier and Poulter as the authority for Cineraria alpina, just 
as on the same page (121) " With, pi.," must be read as a reference to 
a plate in Withering.
The letters " I.

cases, that the plant had been seen somewhere iu the Isle of Wight.

Cenlanrea nigra, L.
After collecting a large number of specimens, I 
have felt quite unable to refer them with any coufideuce to the various 
plants described in the French Floras.
Usually the Centaurea with 
radiant florets has smaller heads, and the scales of the involucre less 
closely covered.
These characters are also found in a dwarf plant without 
radiant florets gathered on Bembridge Down, which I believe is the same 
as that which Mr. Stratton finds on the Downs near Newport with rayed 
florets.
I feel sure no reliance can be placed upon the different length 
or amount of pappus, as on plants otherwise exactly alike I have found 
it long and short and wanting.
With regard to the form described by 
Mr. Stratton in the 'Exchange Club Report' for ] 869, I should refer 
his n.
1 to C.
nemoraUs of Jordan, which I have noticed not unfrequently 
in the damp, clayey meadows about Bembridge, this being apparently the 
typical C.
nigra as understood in England.
Mr. Stratton's no.

plant common on chalky banks seems to be C.

NOTES OF PLANTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF 
OXFORD.
By W.
T. Thiselton Dyer, B.A., B.Sc.
Floras for the counties drained by the upper waters of the Thames are 
still to be worked out.
It would be an interesting contribution towards 
them to explore thoroughly the country about Oxford, taking both sides 
of the Thames valley, although distinguishing, of course, for the benefit 
of future workers in each county, the plants which belong to Oxfordshire 
and Berkshire.
Botanists residing at the University unfortunately go 
away too soon in the summer and come back too late to do very much, 
yet even what is to be seen of the local vegetation is well worth liunting 
up.
As little has been published since Walker's ' Flora ' (which is quite 
out of date), the following notes will probably be useful to some readers 
of the ' Journal of Botany :' — 
Ranunculus pHeudofiidtans, Newb.
ex Bab.
— The marshy meadows about 
Oxford are intersected by numerous anastomosing branches of the Thames.
In early summer these are often covered by dense masses of an aquatic 
Ranunculus, bearing a profusion of large and handsome flowers.
It seems 
to me a state of R.jlonbundus, Bab., without floating leaves, which is all 
I take R.
pseudofluilans to be.
R. Drouetii, Schultz, a Batrachian, distinguishable from R.
Iricho- 
phyllus, Chaix, by its collapsing leaves, is probably distributed throughout 
the Thames basin.
Near Bablock Hythe Ferry, Berks.
R. fluitans.
Lam.
— 1 never detected this species myself, probably from 
its being a Juue-iiowering plant, and later, therefore, than pseudojluitans, 
which is at its prime in May. I have what I take to be an example of it 
from Professor Lawson.
Water-plants come to the front or rather sur- 
face, make their show of flowei's, aud retire in regular succession (see he- 
low with respect to Potumogeion^.
The useful observers who attend to 
the time of flowering would do really important work if they would fix 
for us the date at which plants are at their fullest development, which I 
take it would be when they have a maximum number of flowers exiJanded.

This would be of move biological significance tluiii the dale wlieu the first 
bloom struggles into notice.
Caltha palnstris, L.
— I collected a considerable series of specimens of 
this fine plant from Christ Church Meadow, Avhere, after the subsidence 
of tlie floods, it makes a splendid show.
They probably include C.
G/ie- 
rcnigerii, 13or., in which the sepals being more ovate do not overlap at the 
base.
The flowers I found varied from 2:^ to 1| inches in diameter, and 
with from 8 to 5 sepals.
The radical leaves were, in some cases, almost orbi- 
cular, with overlapping lobes ; iu others triangular-reniforra, with a very 
shallow basal sinus, a form which, except that the flowers are the normal 
size, must approach C.
Jiahelli folia, Pursh.
The toothing of the upper 
leaves varied to any extent.
Arahis Tiirrita, L.
— Although given for Oxford in the ' Student's 
Flora ' and the 'Compendium of the Cybele Britannica,' it is no longer to 
be found growing there spontaneously.
It was exterminated in repairing 
the walls of Magdalen College.
Mr. Baxter informed me that it lingered 
in Magdalen walks, and that he endeavoured to establish it in the island 
in the Cherwell, but was unsuccessful.
Sisymbrium Irio, L., comes up abundantly in the Botanic Garden, 
outside of which it has occurred occasionally as an escape, as in the ad- 
joining lane leading to Christ Church Meadow, and by the side of the 
Cherwell, next the garden.
Diantlms ccesins, Sm., is now well established on many of the old lime- 
stone walls, and was said to have been introduced directly from Cheddar.
It grows, amongst other places, on the garden-wall of Wadham College, 
and near the entrance to the Cathedral.
I have also noticed it on walls 
iu Taunton, Somerset.
Geranium rotandifolium, L.
— Abundant about the Oxfordshire suburbs 
of Oxford.
I do not recall its occurrence on the southern side, though, no 
doubt, it is to be found.
Geiim intermedium, Ehrh.
— Sparingly, with G.
rivale, L., and G.
urha- 
mwi, L., in a copse, near Elsfield, Oxfordshire.
Saitguisorba officinalis, L.
— Abundant in meadows by the Thames, near 
Sandford, Berks.
Likely to be overlooked, as the early leaves are cut with 
the grass.
Hippiiris vulgaris, L.
— Binsey Common, Berks.
Sedum.
dasyphjllum, L.
— Walls at Besselsleigh, Berks.
CEnantlie silaifolia, Bieb.
— Christ Church Meadow, abundant near the 
" Barges." Also in meadows by the river near the old railway station.
(E.
Lachenalii, Gmel.
— BulUngdon, Oxon, H.
Boswell.
(E.
flmiatilis, Colera.
— -There is an early stage of the growth of this 
plant, which is not, I think, described by Mr. Varenne in his paper in the 
' Phytologist ' (o.
s. vol.
iv.
p. 673).
My specimens, collected towards 
the end of April, exhibit a short corm-like rhizome, about an inch in 
length, with very abbreviated internodes, and terminated apparently by 
the base of the flowering stem of the preceding year.
A tuft of leaves, 
about ten inches long, has sprung from one of the nodes.
These leaves 
are not bipinnate, but only pinnate; the pinnse bipinnatifid, with rather 
narrow, almost laciniate segments.
The general outline of the whole 
lamina is oblong, and about four inches in length.
Another baiTeu spe- 
cimen, collected at the end of May, agrees exactly with Mr. Varenne's 
description, being an elongated stem rooting at the nodes, and with 
NOTES OF PLANTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF OXFORD.
117 
leaves decaying' upwards.
The leaves are triangular in outline, bipinnate, 
and with wedge-shaped segments.
This is the common form.
I think 
my earlier specimen may be the base of an old seedling, perpetuated by a 
lateral shoot, a short, vertical rhizome being a common structure in the 
TJvihelWftrcB.
The stems of the other type are developed from lateral 
buds in similar elongated submerged stems towards the autumn, the 
parent stems afterwards breaking up, and decaying.
Mine, I think, was 
wholly a spring growth.
I have since seen specimens of (E.
pimpbieUoideSy 
L., in the British Museum herbarium, collected by Mr. A.
G. More in the 
Isle nf Wight evidently early in the year, which show that in that species, 
the mode of growth is just the same as in my specimen oiJiuviatUis.
Ilieracium amplexlcaide, L.
— Only to be found within the limits of the 
Botanic Garden, where, at the foot of old walls, it is well established.
FraxiiiHS lieterophijlla, Vahl.
— The tree (of course planted) mentioned 
by Walker still stands, though not very healthy, near the eastern end of 
the broad walk in Christ Church Meadow.
Llnaria purpurea.
L. — Walls of churchyard, Iffley, Oxon.
Lathraea squamaria, L.
— Copse near Cumnor Hurst, Berks, but west of 
the high-road.
Teucrium Scordlum, L.
— Banks of the Thames, Godstow, Berks, 
H. Boswell.
Lam'ium maculatum, \i., var.
Irevigatum, L.
— Island in the Cherwell, by 
Christ Church Meadow, ahundant, but no doubt originally derived from 
the Botanic Garden.
Primula variabilis, Goupil.
— Copse near Botley, Berks.
ChenopodiuM miirale, L.
— Near the railway station, Oxford.
Polygonum mite, Schrank.
— Port Meadow, Oxon ; probably to be found 
in low ground near the Thames throughout its course.
It occurs all along 
the Middlesex bank.
Aristolochia Clematitis, L.
— Abundant and very striking in its exotic- 
looking aspect on the side of a deep ditch bounding one side of part of 
the precinct of the nunnery at Godstow, Berks, now used as a kitchen 
garden.
It has no relation to the present cultivation, but is the last 
relic of the ancient use of the ground.
Salix decipiens, Hoffm.
— A large tree, mentioned in W^alker's ' Flora,' 
stood in Christ Church Meadow near the " Barges," but was blown down 
some years since.
A small tree of what I take to be the same species 
grows by the side of the bounding ditch.
-S".
Ilulfinnntiiana, Sm.
— By the Thames between Iffley and Kcnnington 
Island, Oxfordshire side.
Leucoium (cstivum, L.
— Osier Holt between IfHey and Sandford, also 
Kenniiigton Island ; both on Oxfordshire side of river.
Tulipa sylcestris, L.
— By the path round Christ Church Meadow, espe- 
cially close to tlie trunks of trees.
A most stiuited state, hardly to be 
recognized except from the bulbs, and never flowering.
Gagea lutea, Ker.
— I have seen a single specimen, obtained by the 
Rev. T.
0. Marshall, from the Lathrcea locality on Cumnor Hurst, but I 
never succeeded in tinding any more.
Stratiotes aloides, L.
— Pond in Magdalen Meadows ; originally planted, 
and afterwards lost.
Recently replanted by Professor Lawson.
Potamogeton eu-pectinatus, Syme.
— This seems to be the connnoncr 
segregate in the Oxford waters.

148 SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
P. prcBlongm, Wulf.
— Abundant in Thames between Oxford and Sand- 
ford.
This fine species flowers earlier tlian P.
liicens, L., which occupies 
often the same spots.
The surface of the water, covered in May with the 
spikes of prd'lougus, a month later I have found to show nothing but 
those of P.
liicens.
The spikes are probably buoyed up above the water 
by the development of the peduncles.
P. preelongas is stated in the 
' Student's Flora,' to flower, from June to July.
T should imagine this to 
be too late, as I collected it in the middle of May, and some of the 
foliage was already decaying.
Acorns Calamus, L., is very abundant along the Thames banks, cer- 
tainly on the Berkshire side.
Easily recognizable from the waved margins 
of the leaves.
Carex axillaris, Good.

SHOET NOTES AND QUEEIES.
Cyperus Fuscus not a Native.
— This plant was first figured as a 
British plant by Sir W.
Hooker in his continuation of Curtis's ' Flora 
Londoniensis,' vol.
iv.
dated 1821 (see 'Flora of Middlesex,' 298), with 
the following remark: — "For this valuable addition to the flora of the 
British Isles the botanical world is indebted to that zealous and able 
naturalist A.
H. Haworth, Esq., wlio found it in a low, marshy meadow 
scarcely half a mile from his late residence in Little Chelsea.
It grows 
in some abundance on the sides of a ditch along with Juncns lufoiiins, 
Bidens cernna, Rannnculus sceleratus.
Polygonum minus, and other such 
semi-aquatics.
The individual plants here figured and described were 
gathered by the Kev. Mr.
Bree in company with Mr. Haworth, and were 
sent to me on the 27th of September.
Many of the specimens were in 
flower, but more in seed." I believe that this plant has been regarded 
as an iidiabitant of Britain, owing to a mistake of the Kev. Mr.
Bree.
It is very true that the plant grew on the side of a stream called Eelbrook, 
in a common field between the King's Koad and Parson's Green, on the 
Fulham Koad ; but Mr. Haworth made no secret that he had sowed 
it there from seed which he obtained from Swiss specimens which he 
purchased from Mr. Thomas, of Bex, who collected Swiss plants for sale.
This explains why it has not been found in any other locality except 
God aiming, where it was probably also sowed.
The plant did not come 
up every year on the side of the Eelbrook, but appeared in favourable 
seasons.
I believe the field is now drained and built over, or, at least, 
w^as rapidly being so used when I was there a few years ago.
— J.
E. 
Gray.
[In the number of the ' Magazine of Natural History ' for March, 
1831 (iv.
186), the Kev. W.
T. Bree says that "he was directed and 
accompanied to the spot for the express purpose of gathering specimens of 
the plant by A.
H. Haworth himself," who remarked " that it was some- 
what extraordinary the plant should have so long escaped his notice, who 
had for a number of years resided at Chelsea, and botanized with no little 
assiduity in its environs." In S.
F. Gray's ' Natural Arrangement of 
British Plants,' ii.
730 (1821), no hint is given of the plant there called 
Cyperus Ihmortlui having been artificially introduced.
Other facts of its 
history will be found in the ' Flora of Middlesex.' — Henry Trimen.] 
SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.

Accent in Botanical Names.
— In the remarks on this subject by 
Mr. Kobert Tucker, he gives t\vo instances in which I " stand alone," — 
Fetroselinuin and XJrtlca.
It is by a typog-rapliical error in each case ; 
in both words the penult is long ; and as I have accented by the length 
of syllables, the accent shoidd be immediately after the i in these names.
— J.
BoswELL Syme.
Sarracenia purpurea, L.
— In Provancher's ' Flore Canadienne,' 
t. i.
p. 30, it is stated that this curious plant is often cultivated in gardens 
in its native country, and that it may be grown in a damp place or in an 
artificial marsh covered with Sphagnum.
The author states, also, that if 
carefully transplanted in early spring, there is no difficulty in getting it to 
flower in ordinary garden soil.
The attempt to grow it in the open air 
is rarely made in this country.
At the Glasnevin Botanic Gardens, 
however, a fine plant has flourished for the past five years in a small bog 
by the side of the lake.
Nothing could be more satisfactory than the 
appearance of the clump of certainly not less than two dozen well- developed 
pitchers, and this, notwithstanding that in winter it is covered with 
water often frozen over and skated upon.
Dr. Moore had a second plant, 
but this was stolen by a too unscrnpnlous admirer.
Borne years ago 
the rhizomes were introduced into this country as a projwsed remedy for 
smallpox.
Had the plant proved to have been of any value in this 
respect, it would not have probably been difficult to have grown a suf- 
ficient supply of it.
— W.
T. Thiselton Dyer.
Arabis stricta.
Suds.
— In the Supplementary List of Plants for 
Somersetshire, given on the authority of the late Rev. J.
C. Collins, in 
INIr. H.
C. Watson's ' Botanist's Guide,' Arabis stricta is mentioned as 
liaving been observed at Cheddar and rocks on the Quantoch Hills, near 
Merridge.
Can any correspondent of the ' Journal of Botany ' inform 
me if specimens, have been collected from these localities of late years ?
I may take the present opportunity of stating that I should feel greatly 
indebted to botanists for any information respecting the more rare and 
critical plants of the county, having for many seasons past made its 
flora my especial study.
— T.
B. Flower.
Mistletoe on the Oak.
— In addition to the old localities previously 
cited, I find the following in ' Ilortus Collinsonianus ' (privately printed 
by L.
W. Dillwyn, 184-3): — "On the Oak (which is very rare) Mr.
Knowlton has twice seen it.
In August, 1763, three plants were found 
growing on the oak on the estate of AVhite, Esq., at VVatling, 
Wells." — J.
Britten.
Uses of Piiragmites communis.
— The economic applications of 
many of our British plants are fast passing into the region of antiquity.
Amongst our grasses the common Reed {Fhrugmites communis, Trin.) was 
one of the most useful to the peasantry in marshy districts.
The stems 
were not only very generally used for thatching, but also for partitions of 
rooms instead of laths, being plastered over in a similar manner.
They 
were also used in place of boards for building up the sides of sheds and 
outhouses, and for fences and screens in gardens to protect fruit trees.
Though they are still used for these purposes in some parts of the country, 
150 THE LOCAL FIELD-CLUBS OF GREAT BUITAIN.
the more general adoption of bricks and tiles for rural cottages is fast 
displacing the use of thatch, and, consequently, the use of the reed.
We 
have been told that the stems of this plant are used for the drones of the 
Scotch bagpipes as well as for the Northumberland small pipes ; but the 
stems of Arundo Donax have usually had the credit of being employed for 
bagpipes and other wind instruments.
Can any one confirm either of 
these queries ?
— J.
K. Jackson.
[In Germany the common Reed is 
much used for making matting for protecting hotbeds, etc.
; and children 
make small pipes of the stems.
— B.
Seemann.] 
Walking-sticks.
— Few people, probably, have any idea of the ex- 
tent of the trade in walking and umbrella sticks.
Having recently re- 
ceived from one of the largest makers in London a collection of walking- 
stick materials for the Museum, I was not a little surprised to tlnd among 
them such woods as the Carob {Ceratonia SiUqua), a Eucalyptus, pro- 
bably E.
globiihis, both from Algeria; Soapberry {Sapindiis saponaria), 
and Flowered Ebony {Brya Ehenus), both from the W^est Indies.
The fol- 
lowing, however, I cannot easily determine.
One thick, clumsy-looking 
stick, labelled " Citheure, from the Haute-Garonne, France," has very 
much the appearance of a gigantic stalk of the common Burdock {Arctium 
Lappa), and another, labelled " Jerusalem Thistle, imported from Smyrna," 
appears like an Articlioke or Sunflower stem.
Perhaps some reader of the 
' Journal of Botany ' can say whether the stems of these plants are com- 
monly used for walking-sticks in any part of the countries from wherice 
they are said to have been imported.

THE LOCAL FIELD-CLUBS OF GREAT BRITAIN.
By James Britten, F.L.S.
VII.
The Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club.
This was the second Field Club, in respect of date, established in 
Britain, and from the scientific value of its printed Transactions, mav 
justly be considered the first in importance.
It was founded on the 25t'li 
of April, 1846, for the joint purpose of investigating the Natural History 
and Antiquities of the district.
The officers consist of a President, Vice- 
President, Committee, and Secretary, all of whom are chosen annually.
The subscription was fixed at 5s.
per annum, ladies being admitted as 
honorary members.
The publication of correct lists of the various na- 
tural productions of the counties of Northumberland and Durham was 
among the objects which it was proposed to accomplish ; as well as the 
formation of local collections, illustrative of such lists, which were to be 
placed in the Newcastle museum.
With a view to the more convenient 
carrying out of these arrangements, a sub-committee was appointed for 
each branch of natural science.
Five fiehl-mectings are held during each 
year, the first of these having taken place on May 26, 1846.
Mr. Ralph 
Carr and Mr. John Thornhill were respectively President and Secretary 
during the first year of the Society's existence.
The first volume of the Transactions of the Club was published in 1850, 
and at once took a high posilion, from the scientific value of the pajjcis 
im LOCAL FIKLIJ-CLUBS OF GliEAT BRITAIN.
151 
wliich it contained, — a position wiiicU has been ably maintained by the 
succeeding volumes.
It contained a summary of the proceedings during 
1846-50, with a catalogue of the insects of Northuniberhand and Durham, 
by Messrs.
J. Hardy and T.
J. Bold ; of the mollusca, by Joseph Alder ; 
of the fossils of the Permian system, by Richard Howse ; and various 
shorter papers of equal value and interest.
Many insects new to Britain, 
and even to science, were first published and described in these Transac- 
tions, which may be looked upon as the most important contribution made 
by any Society to the knowledge of the Natural History of Great Britain.
The Club continued in its useful career for many years uninterrupted 
by any events which require special notice here.
Fortunate in having for 
its officers men of undoidjted ability, who were willing to devote them- 
selves in no ordinary degree to the advancement of science, it is not to be 
wondered at that the Society maintained the advanced position which it 
had taken up at its commencement.
All who have had anything to do 
with a local body of this description know how important it is that a fit- 
ting President and Secretary should be secured; and the names of those 
who have filled these posts in the Tyneside Club are ample guarantees 
that nothing further could be desired in these respects.
In 1864 an arrangement was made between the Club and the old- 
established Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and 
Nevvcastle-upon-Tyne, by which the then members of the former were re- 
cognized as associates of the latter; those who subsequently joined the 
club paying 5s.
entrance fee in addition to their subscription.
The 
Transactions of the Chib, of which six volumes had appeared, sul)se- 
quently adopted the title of the 'Natural History Transactions of Nortli- 
umberland and Durham.' Of this new series three volumes are pub- 
lished, that which most concerns us being the ' Flora of Northumberland 
and Durham,' by Mr. Baker and Dr. Tate, which has been fully noticed 
in these pages.* The various catalogues are still in course of publication, 
the last volume containing a paper on the " Crustacean Fauna of the Salt 
Marshes," and a "Catalogue of the Aculeate Hymenoptera" of the two 
counties.
The actual number of members at present enrolled is 5 57 ; the Pre- 
sident is G.
S. Brady, Esq., and the Secretaries, Thomas Thompson and 
P. M orison, Esqrs.
It is much to be desired that the Natural History 
Societies of our larger towns would take the Tyneside Club as an example 
of what such bodies ought to be, and would endeavour especially to do 
a similar service to science by the publication of equally important and 
useful transactions.
The following are the titles of the botanical papers, exclusive of short

Professor Karl Koch has l)rought to the publication of this very useful 
work a good deal more than the industry of the mere compiler.
He is well 
known to have been long occupied with the origin of our cnltivated fruit- 
trees ; and no more important inquiry could be suggested to a critical 
worker nor one more likely to produce information available for other 
studen s besides geographical botanists.
For four years the author travelled ' 
11 western Asia, during which time he was always on the look-out for any 
plants which could be identified with the wild originals of cultivated 
forms.
A short paper read before the British Association gave a resume 
of his principal results, and concluded with a promise which the publica- 
tioii of the present volume has in part fulfilled.
We have so far the whole 
ot the cultivated arborescent Fohjpetalce, which are able to adapt them- 
selves to the climate of North and Mid-Europe.
To what eient the 
mihappy distractions which have produced lamentable hiatuses in so 
many fields of scientific research will postpone the publication of fresh 
instalments must be a matter of uncertainty ; but it is to be hoped that 
u-e shall not have to wait long for the conclusion of a work which will be 
the standard authority in its subject.
It will be interesting to give Dr. Koch's opinions upon a few points.
Of the Pear section of the genus Pyrus, six species are enumerated —

P. Acliras is considered to be the stock of most of our Pears, though 
P. dceagnifolia and Persica by cultivation and accidental crossing have 
also given rise to varieties.
M. Decaisne, however, believes that all have 
sprung from one stock.

taken its name from the Cherry, and not the Cherry from it), and P.

Dumort., the native country of which is not known.
The Almond and Peach are separated under tlie Linnsean species of 
Amygdalns coinmunis and A.
Persica, although there is ground for be- 
lieving, with Mr. Darwin, that the Peach is derived from the Almond.* 
The original country of either is unknown, though Mid- Asia is suggested 
for the Almond, and Persia for the Peach.
De Candolle, however, be- 
lieves, on etymological grounds, that it came originally from China.

Reports of Experiments on the Injluence of various Manures made in the 
Horticultural Society's Gardens, Chiswick, in 1869.
By Dr. M.
T. 
Masters, F.R.S., and Dr. J.
H. Gilbert, F.Tl.S. London.
1870.
(From the Proceedings of the Royal Horticultural Society.) 
For these important experiments twelve species of plants were selected 
as typical of meadow herbage, and upon these the action of particular 
manures was tried.
The plants included six Grasses, three Clovers, 
and three pasture weeds.
Some defects of the experiments, unavoid- 
able in a first series, are easily seen.
The boxes, apparently of four 
superficial feet and eighteen inches deep, though seventy-two in number, 
did not include a single (hiplicate of any one of the experiments, and the 
results consec[uently lacked a most important element of control.
The 
value of thousands of farm experiments of a similar kind, but on a larger 
scale, is sadly lessened, owing to the same radical defect ; and on the 
farm the variations in the plots as to soil, etc., are, of course, much more 
serious sources of error than any likely to exist in the Chiswick trials.
Still we hope, in spite of the increase of troulde involved by doubling 
the number of boxes, that a duplicate of each experiment will be arran<i.e(l.
If it had not been desirable to make the Chiswick series a continuation 
and aid to the Rothamsted series, we should have counselled simpler 
manures and a smaller number of distinct plots, omitting, say 3 and 5, 
out of the subjoined series : — -

1. Uninanured.
2. Mineral manure.
3. Ammonia salts.
4. Nitrate of soda.
5. Ammonia salts and mineral mannre.
6. Nitrate of soda and mineral manures.
The mineral manure consisted of the sulpliates of potash and magnesia, 
cai'bonate and phosphate of lime, and chloride of sodium.
The mixture 
was applied at the rate of 39.50 lb.
per acre, a quantity which corre- 
sponded to less than six ounces per box.
For box 3 a mixture of sul- 
phate and chloride of ammonium, at the rate of 800 lb.
per acre, was used, 
and for box 4, 1100 lb.
of nitrate of soda.
For box 5 the manures for 
2 and 3 were joined, and for box 6 those for 3 and 4.
The manures 
were intimately mixed with the whole of the soil in the boxes.
The 
twelve kinds of seed were sown in the several-prepared soils on April 1, 
1869.
In spite of the great care and pains bestowed on these experiments, 
and the constant attention which they received during the season of 
groAvth, several circumstances are acknowledged to have impaired their 
value.
The soil was too rich, while the seeds were not in all cases free 
i'rom admixture, and were too thickly sown.
Yet, after all, some very 
interesting results have been obtained, valuable for comparison with past 
experiments, and indicating the proper method to be pursued in further in- 
quiries.
We are bound to say that many of the commonly-neglected con- 
ditions of agricultural experiments, such as temperature, rainfall, with the 
proportion of stem to root, etc., were duly recorded iu the Chiswick 
series.- 
We now proceed to give a very brief outline of the chief results 
obtained, premising, however, that a clear conception of the whole condi- 
tions and bearing of the experiments can be gathered only from the study 
of the original report.
1. In the unman ured boxes, nine out of the twelve species experimented 
with showed the minimmn degree of vigour.
The exceptions were in the 
cases of AntJioxanthmn odoratum, Lotus cornicnlatus, and Achillea Mille- 
folium.
The deficiency of rain had generally less injurious effect upon 
the plants in the unmauured boxes than iu those which had been artifi- 
cially stimulated to increased growth, especially by nitrogenous appli- 
cations.
2. The boxes supplied with mineral manures exhibited poor results in 
the case of five Grasses out of six, the exception being the box of Poa 
annua.
But two of the three Clovers, Trifolium jjratense and 1\ repenn, 
attained a high development, the thii'd plant, Lotm coruicidutits, being 
here an exception.
3. Ammonia salts benefited considerably all the Grasses save the An- 
tlioxantlinm and Lolium.
The two species of Trifolium showed biit a low 
degree of vigour, but the Lotus attained a medium degree of develop- 
ment.
4. Nitrate of soda exercised less influence upon the species of Poa 
than upon the other Grasses, which latter mostly attained to a greater 
degree of development than in the preceding series with ammonia salts.
The nitrate of soda proved of little use to the Clovers.
5. When mineral manures and ammonia salts were used together, they

exercised a generally favourable iiiHuence upon the Grasses up to the 
time of cutting, but the plants declined in vigour afterwards.
In the 
White Clover and Lotus the development was uniformly high, b it in the 
T. praiense there was a decline in October.
6. When mineral manures and nitrate of soda were employed together, the 
effects were generally similar to those in the preceding series (5).
This 
mixture did little to stimulate the growth of one of the plants experi- 
mented upon, the Plautctf/o lanceolatn, which did not attain muc'i luxuri- 
ance when dressed with nitrogenous manures.
The above resvdts constitute but a small part of one set of obs nwations 
in the Report of Drs. Masters and Gilbert.
Another set relates to the 
condition of the plants in the middle of October ; another to the state of 
the roots of the various plants in the following April (1870) ; while 
another set gives the contrasts observable between the growth of the root 
and herbage in the seventy-two experiments.
Two admirable features of 
the Report cannot, however, be left unnoticed, even in the meagr; outline 
which we have attempted to draw.
We refer to the analytical tibles on 
pp.
6i to 67, and to the diagrammatic i-epresentations of the fluctuations 
in the growth, etc.
of the various plants.
These conclude the Report.
The analytical work was performed in the Rothamsted Laborat^-y with 
appliances and with a care which scarcely anywhere else in Englan I could 
have been obtained.
It includes the total weights of dry vegeta')le sub- 
stance produced in each box, the total weights of the plant as'ies from 
each experiment, and the percentage proportions of ash to dry v^-getable 
substance.
AVe quote, as indicating some of the valuable bearings of such inquiries 
as the present, the concluding paragraph of Dr. Gilbert's remarks : — 
" If the results of the first season's experiments do not, as hardly could 
be expected that they would, afford very satisfactory evidence in regard 
to the many points of interest which experiments of the kind ar>; calcu- 
lated to elucidate, at any rate much experience has been gained as to the 
conduct of future trials; and the discussion of the results themselves can- 
not fail to indicate how much we may hope to learn when the unfavour- 
able conditions have been avoided, fiwourable ones carefully secun-d, and 
the results attentively studied.
The relatively varying dependence of 
different plants on soil and atmospheric conditions respectively, the effects 
of varying conditions as to soil-supply, the tendency to luxuriance on the 
one hand or to maturation on the other, or the widely varying special 
characters of development, according to the external conditions provi(h'd, 
are points Avhich, when thoroughly investigated and generally understood, 
must serve to place the cultivation of plants for various purposes — 
whether for the supply of wood, of fibre, of food, of drug or colour in 
some special organ, of fruits or of flowers — on the sin-e basis of scientific 
principle, rather than leave it dependent on the still uncertain, tliouiih 
often wonderfully successful, guidance of empiricism.
May not such 
knowledge, too, give much insight into the varying functions of plants 
which have been held to be allied to, or separated from, each other, as- the 
case may be, for reasons (piite indepeuflent of the sources of their accu- 
mulation, or the special tendency of their assimilative actions?"

The pollen in this Order is usually scattered before the flower opens; the

From the 
examination of mainly dried specimens, it appears that there are arrange- 
ments in many genera to prevent self-fertilization.
In Pctropliila, the 
stigmatic surface is shielded in the bud by the perianth-segment ; in a 
section of Persoonia, the style is turned away from the stamens, and 
received into a pouch; wdiilst in Coiiospermum, the lowest, and in Si/)ia-

By Dr. iiobert Brown.
In this paper Dr. Brown gives a review of some 
of the more important researches made by Danish botanists during the 
last few years, and published chiefly in the Danish langungc, in the 
'JVansactions of the Natural History Society, the Botanical Society, the 
Academy of Sciences, or as s-parate works.
After noticing the proposed 
removalof tiie Botanic Garden from the centre of the city of Copenhagen, 
where it has long been, he called attention to the foundation of the 
BotanisJc Forening, or Botanical Society, which now numbers between 
one and two hundred honorary, resident, non-resident and foreign mem- 
bers, and publishes a yearly ' Tidsskrift,' or fasciculus of transactions, con- 
taining many papers of merit.
The last part is occupied by l^ranth and 
Ilostrup's "Licheries Danise.' It is under the Presidency of Professor 
Lange, and is yearly increasing in importance and numbers.
The publica- 
tion of the 47th livraison of the ' Flora Danica,' under the editorship of 
Professor Lange, marks an era in Danish botany, and keeps up the high 
reputation this work has attained.
The present part contains, like its 
predecessors, 60 plates, representing 75 plants (14 of these being 
varieties already partially described in the ' Flora Danica ' and two 
PROCEEDIXGS OF SOCIETIES.
157 
liybrids), of wliicli 2-i have not been figured previously in any icono- 
graphic work.
The pktes are executed by Mr. Tiiornman.
Perhaps 
next to the ' Flora Daiiica ' the most important botanical work produced 
in Denmark of late is ' L'Amerique Centrale ' of Professor A.
S. Oer- 
sted, the results of journey in Costa llica and Nicaragua in 1846-48.
As yet onlv the first part is issued, partly at the expense of the Danish 
Academy of Sciences.
It contains 18 folio pages of letterpress descrip- 
tive of the physical features of the country, a map, two physiognomical 
views, and 18 magnificent plates in copper, representing new' species of 
plants.
(Reviewed in .Journ.
of Bot. 1865, p.
102.) Oersted has 
also published an elaborate memoir on the classification of the Oaks, 
founded on the form of the pistil, venation of leaves, etc., which dif- 
fers materially from that of De CandoUe and other preceding writers, 
and is a valuable contribution to the history of the GupuUfercB.
To 
the ' Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences ' the same author has 
also contributed a paper on the " Silphion " of the ancients, which, 
from a study of the classical writers, Greek coins, and vases, he con- 
siders was a species of plant allied to Narthex Asa-fcelida, and which 
he proposes to call Narthex SUphinm.
Professor Oersted's numerous 
papers on the development of Fungi, his recently published ' Introduc- 
tion to the Study of Cellular Plants,' bis ' Memoir on the Morphology of 
the Coniferte,' etc., were also noticed.
Of late years Dr. Eugene Warming 
has visited Brazil, and made collections of plants chiefly in the vicinity of 
Lagoa Santa.
These are now in course of description by himself and 
other botanists, chiefly Augustus Progel, J.
A. Schmidt, Johannes Miiller 
(Argoviensis), Otto Bockler, C.
F. Meissner, A.
W. Eiehler, J.
G. Baker, 
Ernst Hanipe, George v.
Martens, and Otto Nordstedt.
The memoirs of 
these botanists are published chiefly in the ' Natural History Society's 
Transactions,' are written in Latin, and contain descriptions and critical 
and geographical notes of many new or little known species.
Warming has 
published in the same place remarks on the development of heat in PJd- 
lodendron Lund'd (n.
sp.) from Brazil.
The development of heat daring 
the flowering period embraces two calorific undulations.
The first day 
the greatest temperature is towards 6 to half-past 7 o'clock p.m. It then 
abates and falls to the normal heat during the night.
The next day the 
calorific movement attains its cuhninating-point, 8 to 10 a.m., and ceases 
towards noon.
These observations are made on a plant which flowered from 
the 16th to 17th of November, 1864.
The culminating-points of the ca- 
lorific iindulation do not coincide with the time when the temperature of the 
air is at its maximum (viz.
2.30 p.m.).
However, there has been observed a 
certain dependence between them of this kind, that when the temperature 
of the spadix was more or less high, so also was the temperature of the air.
The first period of heat presented the greatest intensity.
Not only did 
the temperature last a ranch longer time, but was more elevated than in 
the second period.
The greatest heat \\hich Dr. Warming has observed, 
was 39^° C, the temperature of the air being then 23f°, showing a dif- 
ference of 15f'^.
The difterencc in the part occupied by the stamens ivas 
even higher, viz.
18|^°.
The anthers did not open or discharge their 
pollen until the evening of the second day, after which the caloriflc 
movement ceased.
At the time of the development of heat the inflo- 
rescence gave forth an aromatic odour, which was much stronger when 
the temperature was more elevated.
The spadix is constantly surrounded

Among 
the other researches noticed were Oersted's paper on Bldens plalycepha ; 
Warming, on the spiral arrangement of the leaves of (JucurbitacecB, and on 
Scopiola atropoidt'S and other Solanacere ; Laiige's addition to his 
' Handbook of the Danish Flora,' Didriclisen's ' History of Daiii;~h 
Botany,' and Warming's ' Inaugural Thesis on the Inflorescence or Deve- 
lopment of Enphorhia.'' The review concluded with some account of 
recent Danish excursions to Iceland and Greenland, and the results 
derived therefrom.

" On Li'ium canadense, L., var.
puberutum, Toir.
By Dr. Eobert 
Brown.
In the enumeration of Dr. Bigelow's C;ilifornian collections 
in the fourth volume of the ' Pacitic Eailroad Surveys ' (Bot. p.
146), 
Professor Torrey notes a variety of LUium canadense, distinguished by 
its stem and peduncles being minutely pubescent, the leaves broadly 
lanceolate, with the margin and nerves pubenilous, the flowers (2-7) 
largely pedunculated, the sepals markedly reflexed and purple-spotted 
within.
In the course of examining his own and the late Mr.
Jeffrey's collection, Dr. Brown had found specimens which corre- 
sponded to Torrey's description, but the characters are by no means 
constant, nor are all fouud on or.e plant.
In specimens of Lilium cana- 
dense, gathered in Canada, the leaves were found quite as broad as any 
from North-West America, and in numerous specimens of Lilium cana- 
dense frum Oregon, California, and British Columbia, the leaves were 
almost linear-lanceolate.
The pubescence is not a constant character; 
for while it was found on young plants, it was absent from old, nor was 
constant in either ; most probably it is caducous.
The result of this is, 
that in all likelihood there is only one form of Liliion canadense found over 
the whole North American continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 
that any varieties are merely local, and the result of habitat, age or other cir- 
cumstances, which do not give the characters derivetl tiierefrom any kind 
of speciiic value.—" Report on the Open Air Vegetation at the Eoyal

" Notes on Polygonum minus and its allies," by G.
E. Hunt, 
In reference to the discussion at this Society in November last (see p.
30), 
as to the claims of Polygonum mite, Schrank, to rank as a native of 
Cheshire, in support of which it was stated that "so long ago as 1828, 
Mr. W.
Wilson, of Warrington, sent the plant from a Cheshire locality 
under the erroneous name of P.
minus to the late Sir W.
J. Hooker, in 
whose herbarium at Kew the specimens still are," — Mr. Hunt stated that, 
through the kindness of Mr. Baker, of Kew, he had been since furnished 
with the perianths and fruit of the original specimen referred to above, 
and had compared them carefully with P.
minus and miie from various 
stations both in Britain and from the Continent.
The comparison quite 
satisfied him that the Kew specimen from Cheshire could not be asso- 
ciated with P.
mite, but was correctly referred by Mr. Wilson to P.
minus, 
Huds.
Specimens were sent to Mr. Baker for his opinion, and his reply 
was as follows, in a letter dated 31st January, 1871 : — " I believe, now that 
I have laid the nuts side by side, and compared them carefully, that you 
are quite right about t\\e'Polygouiim." 1 may further add that all the

specimens also of more recent collection from Lancasliire and Cheshire 
seen by me belong to P.
mbius, finds.
The distinctive characters and 
synonymy of the species were then given.
Mr. Hardy remarked that it 
would appear from Mr. Hunt's remarks that, besides Mr. Baker, two at 
least of our oldest and most able botanists had failed to difterentiate 
P. minus and P.
mite when specimens were before them.
In support of 
what was stated at the previous meeting- of the Society, as quoted by 
Mr. Hunt, he read the following extract from an article in the ' Phyto- 
log-ist' (vol.
ii.
p. 3-32), by Mr. H.
C. Watson, " On the Pohjgoniim mile 
of Schrank and allied species " : — " Cheshire specimens (of P.
mite) are 
in the herbarium of Sir W.
J. Hooker, sent by Mr. William Wilson, under 
the name of P.
minus (1828) ; I have also European specimens of the 
same species, sent with the names of laxijlorum, Weihe, duljimn, Braun, 
Braunii, Bluff and Fing., and mite, Persoon.
Mr. Hardy declined assent 
to Mr. Hunt's dictum that the relative size of the nut furnished the only 
good character by which to separate the tv^o plants, believing that the 
size of the flower and the habit of growth, when occurring side by side, 
as these specimens did, ought not to be passed over ; the leaves, too, of 
the Mere Mere specimen in particular were actually more broadly lanceo- 
late than those of the Oxford and Surrey specimens traced by Mr. Hunt ; 
and both the nuts and flowers larger than any of the other selected 
P. viinns exhibited by Mr. Hunt, and doubtless correctly named.
The 
piesence or absence of glands was, he believed, an important character ; 
but it was requisite, for the observation of these, that the specimens 
should be freshly gathered.
Mr. Hunt's localities for P.
mite in Britain 
are all southern, but Mr. Baker, in his ' North Yorkshire,' gives no less 
than four localities for it, two in the immediate neighbourhood of the city 
of York, and one as far north as Thirsk.
Mr. Hardly also referred inci- 
dentally to the notes by the Hon. J.
Warren in this Journal (pp.
8, 9) on 
the Mere Mere P.
nodosum, and the Cheshire Epilohium obscurum, and 
stated that he believed the former to be the seedling form of P.

The death is announced, on the 3rd of April, of William Wilson, of 
Warrington, at the age of seventy-two.
He was apprenticed to a soli- 
citor at Manchester, and for a few years practiced his profession at War- 
rington, after which he devoted himself to science.
In 1826, he made 
the acquaintance of Sir J.
E. Smith and Professor Henslow, and by them 
was introduced to Dr. W.
J. Hooker, with whose class, he, in 1827*, made 
his first botanical excursion.
He greatly helped both Smith and Hooker 
in their ' British Floras,' and soon took a high place amongst botanists.
From about 1830, he specially studied Mosses, and the ' Bryolo^ia 
Britannica,' which he published in 1855, is still the text-book of English 
students of that group of plants.
A new edition is much wanted, as 
about a hundred new British species have been detected since its publica- 
tion, and this want Mr. Wilson had hoped to have supplied, but his 
* Not so.

declining health compelled him, shortly before his death, to desire his 
publishers to secure aiiotlier editor.
Besides this, Mr. Wilson described 
the Mosses for Dr. J.
D. Hooker's ' Flora Antarctica,' Seemann's ' Botany 
of the Voyage of H.M.S. Herald,' and Drummond's ' American Musci;' 
lie also published many new exotic species in Hooker's ' London Journal

raked as on any previous 20th of March.
The ruin caused by the shells 
has been quite repaired, and nothing is wanting but plants, which, no 
doubt, will soon be replaced by the other public gardens of Europe.
By 
the way, it would have been a great gain to gardening if the old place 
had been utterly destroyed.
Then, perhaps, a scientific garden, worthy of 
Paris in design as well as in contents, might some day be the result.

is, perhaps, the worst example of the numerous public gardens that are 
laid out in direct violation of the most essential and evident principles of 
garden design." Perhaps the doubtful gain Mr. Robinson longs for may 
still be attained.

Dr. Eobert Brown, of Campster, has described in the ' Annals and 
Magazine of Natural History ' for April, three new species of Qnercus 
from north-west America.
The Leeds Philosophical Society have secured Mr. L.
C. Miall, of 
Bradford, a good botanist, as Curator of their excellent museum.
We are sorry to see that Mr. Twining's economic museum at Twicken- 
ham has been destroyed by fire.
The attention of our readers is called to the well-written and illustrated 
papers on " I^otany for Beginners," in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle,' which 
may be recommended, we think, with confidence to any one wishing to 
commence the study.
The Report of the Botanical Exchange Club is jirinted, and will be 
very soon issued to members.
The Winchester and Hampshire Scientific and Literary Society, which 
in March 1870 formed a botanical section, is to be congratulated on that 
step.
Under the Hon. Secretary's (Mr. F.
J. Warner) energetic super- 
intendence, the section held seven meetings last year, and made three ex- 
cursions.
The same gentleman, with the assistance of two other botanists, 
has prepared a list of species in the immediate neighbourhood of Win- 
chester, which is to be published in a future Report.
Surely there is hope 
now of a Flora of Hampshire.

SUGAR IN BEET-ROOT.
By a.
H. Church, M.A., E.C.S., 
Professor of Chemistry, Royal Agricultural College.
(Plate CXVII.) 
Climate, season, soil, and manure, all have an influence on the amonnt 
of suo'ar produced in the root of the sugar-beet.
On one occasion seed, 
saved from good Silesian sngar-beet, containing, on an average, about 
13 per cent, of sugar, yielded plants the roots of which did not furnish 
more than one-fourth this percentage, for the\'had been too heavily dressed, 
with farmyard manure.
In wet seasons, also, the roots may become 
very large, but the quantity of sugar they contain will not oidy be propor- 
tionately or relatively less, but may even be absolutely smaller in amount 
per root.
Should, on the other hand, the season prove unusually dry 
and hot, a premature development, in the first year, of the flowering stem 
may take place, and this will be attended with a loss of sugar amounting 
to from one-eighth to one-fourth of the whole quantity present in the root.
Yet, from the experiments of Coren winder (.Jahresbericht Agric.
Chera.
1867, p.
127) the normal flowering of this biennial plant is attended by a 
complete consumption of its whole store of sugar.
It is a singular fact 
that the seed produced in the first year from a sugar-beet plant of a good 
strain yields roots which only contain from 2"75 to 6"23 per cent, of 
sugar, according to the experiments of the chemist just named.
Many 
other facts of physiologiral as well as agricultural interest relating to the 
occurrence and disappearance of sugar in this root have been recorded.
It is, for instance, well known that in such beets as grow partly out of 
the ground the percentage of sugar in the exposed portion may be only 
one-third (3-7 per cent.) of that contained (11'2 per cent.) in the covered 
portion.
Even in roots which have no tendency to leave the soil (a 
quality as valuable as the hereditary sugar-producing character), upper 
horizontal sections of a root contain rather less sugar than lower sections.
Any variations which may exist in the saccharine richness of the several 
vertical zones of the root, reckoning from its axis to its circumference, 
do not appear to have been studied.
In the present notice I merely intend to record a series of experiments 
on the gradual development of sugar in beet-roots during the summer and 
autumn of the years 1869 and 1870.
And I piu'pose, in giving the more 
complete experiments of the latter year, to exhibit them especially in rela- 
tion to the amoiuit of rainfall.
The first series of experiments was made in 18G9 with Silesian sugar- 
beet seed, kindly furnished me by Mr. James Duncan, of Mincing Lane, 
who has successfully established a beet- sugar factory, at Laveiduim, in 
Suffolk.
Hoots taken up from the same experimental ground at Ciren-- 
cester at the undermentioned dates gave the following percentages : — 
September Stli, 1809 .

162 SUGAR IN BEET-ROOT.
But this series of sugar-estimations was too imperfect to admit of satis- 
factory conclusions being drawn from it.
So, in 1870, another and far 
more complete series of observations Avas made.
The soil was analysed 
and the rainfall and temperature regularly recorded, while the determina- 
tions of sugar, commenced in August, were continued at fortnightly inter- 
vals, until December.
The weight of the plants taken up for analysis at 
each successive period, was also noted, with the proportion of root to leaf 
which they showed.
I do not propose to give liere all these details of the 
experiments, but to confiue my remarks to the main conditions affecting 
the production of sugar in the root.
The table prefixed to this note (Plate CXVII.) represents the rainfall 
during, and the percentage of sugar after, a series of fortnightly periods.
Before making a few remarks on the " sugar-curve," I present, in the 
annexed table, some of the chief data of the experiments : —

It should be added that the average weiglit of the roots increased regu- 
larly and to a considerable extent at first, in periods I., II., and III.
; 
afterwards, the increase was less regular.
Tlie temperature of the season 
had attained its maximum three weeks before Aug. 9th, and after that date 
decreased pretty steadily.
The most obvious conclusions to be drawn from the above table are the 
following : — 
1. During root-development in August, and down to September 20th, 
the leaves do not proportionately increase, but present a relative diminu- 
tion of about one-third.
2. During the period referred to above, in I., the absolute quantity of 
siigar increases considerably, but, owing to the great increase in tlie abso- 
lute weight of the roots, its percentage proportion is only raised by about 
one-fifth of its percentage at tlie beginning of this period.
3. During October, the most rapid development of sugar takes place, 
the virtual maximum of the season being reached at the end of that month.
4. The fortnight without rain, ending Oct. 4th, was that in which the 
greatest increment in the percentage of sugar occun-ed (and, it may be 
added from other data, only an insignificant addition to the weight of the 
roots was made).
It is intended to continue these experiments, and to render them as 
complete as possible.
It is hoped that important facts in the physiolo- 
gical chemistry of sugar may thus ultimately be learnt.

IS JCORUS CALAMUS A NATIVE?
By Henry Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
The late Dr. Bromfield, in liis eatalogue of Hampshire phints, thus 
writes (Phytol.
iii.
p. 1009), — "I have a lurking suspicion that the 
Sweet Flag may not be aboriginal to Britain ;" and he gives as a reason 
for this doubt the absence of any record of the plant as wild in the 
herbals of Turner, Gerarde, and Parkinson.
I am informed by Mr.
Hemslry that Mr. Borrer also considered it " probably planted " in the 
county of Sussex, where, as well as in Hampshire, it is confined to a 
single station.* In the Thames valley, however, the Acorns holds a far 
n.ore prominent place, and is common by the side both of t]»e main 
stream and of its tributaries as well as round ponds ; in the eastern 
counties it is stated to be equally or more common.
Its area is pretty 
wide, extending from the south coast to Lancashire and York.
In the 
neighbourhood of London it is thoroughly wild, and this is doubtless the 
case elsewhere in England, for, with the exception of Dr. Bromfield above 
quoted, all the writers on our flora have deemed it a native.
Watson 
says (Cyb. Brit.
iii.
31) "apparently a true native," and (Compend.
848) 
" native " ; Babington and Hooker pass it witliout a doubt ; Benthani 
says (' Handbook,' ed.
2. p.
436) " believed to be indigenous only in 
some of the eastern counties of England " ; and A.
de CandoUe does not 
include it in his list of species certainly or probably naturalized in Great 
Britain (Geog.
Bot. 645-097).
My attention has been lately directed to the matter by reading 
M. Devos's notes on the naturalized and introduced plants of Belgium in 
the Bull.
Soc. Bot.
Belg.
1870, pp.
5-122, where, after a review of the 
history of the plant on the Continent, lie points out that in Belgium, as 
in all western Europe, the Acorns, though now very well and widely 
established, was unknown before nearly the end of the sixteenth century.
He therefore classes it with the " denizens," using that term as Mr. H.
C. 
Watson has employed it.
"With tlie view of seeing whether any and what 
countenance the history of the plant in Britain gives to this view, I have 
looked over the botanical literature of our country, and I may say at once 
that the general result is a corroboration of M.
Devos's inferences.
M. A.
de Candolle classes the data upon which conclusions with 
regard to naturalization n)ust be based, in the absence of positive proofs, 
under the three groups of historical, linguistic, and botanical.
I will in 
the case before me take them in that order.
William Turner, in his first' book, the ' Libellus novus ' of 1538, fol- 
lowed Brunfels in making Acorns (of the ancients) to be Iris Psend- 
acorus.
He soon discovered his error, and in the names of plants (1548) 
says, that " Acorns groweth not in England." He knew no more of it 
than the root, then largely sold as a drug, which he describes in his 
'Herball,' pt.
1. B.
ii.
(ed'.
1, 1551), and p.
21 (ed.
2, 1568).
Lobel, 
however, in 1575, was able to examine a living plant in the garden of 
" .Tohainies Dilsins," at Liege, which had been sent by Clusius, who ob'- 
taiiu'd it from l^ithjnia (' 01)servationes,' p.
20).
The plant seen by 
Lobel had no flowers, but he has very well described the root and 
* Mr. Hemsley has since observed it in a second one, in Arundel Park, where 
he tJiinks, it may have been planted.

leaves.
This botanist was mucli in England, and paid special attention 
to the aquatic plants about London.
When Clusius, in 1583, pul)lished 
his ' History of Pamionic Plants,' which also contains his few notes on 
English Botany, lie added to the stock of knowledge about Aeorus by 
figuring the inflorescence, giving details of the Bithynian locality at 
" Prusa " (Brussa?), and informing ns (p.
261) that Frisius saw it, in 
1577, near Vilna, abundantly, where the inhabitants call it Tartarsky, 
because its properties were first made known to them by the Tartars.* 
It soon began to get known in gardens.
In 1586, Robin grew it in the 
Royal Gardens at Paris (Hist.
Gen. Lngd.
p. 1618), and in 1596 we 
find it enumerated in the catalogue (p.
1) of Gerarde's garden in London.
Here we are told (' llerball,' p.
56) it prospered "exceedingly well," but 
never bore catkins.
Gerarde obviously had no notion tluit it was a 
native of this country ; he merely repeats the previously-repoi'ted exotic 
localities.
Johnson, in his revised edition of Gerarde's ' Herball,' gives a 
better figure (Clusius's), and says that, in 1632, he received from' 
"Mr. Thomas Glynn, of Glynullivon, in Carnarvonshire, .
. .
the pretty 
Julus, or floure of this plant, which I could never see here about London, 
though it groweth with us in many gardens, and that in great plenty " 
(p.
63).
Johnson apparently looked upon it as entirely a garden plant, 
and says (p.
64) it may be " fitly called in English the Sweet Garden 
Flag;" whilst his contcmporaiy, Parkinson, a very accurate botanist, 
says explicitly that it is a stranger, " not growing with us " (Theat.
Bot.
p. 4-0).
Acorns is not included in Ray's ' Catalogue of Cambridge 
Plants' (1660); but in Merrett's ' Pinax,' first printed in 1666, it is 
entered as "found by Dr. Brown, near Lyn, and by Mr. Brown, of 
Oxford, near Iledlcy, in Surry" (p.
2).
These localities are also given 
in the first edition of Ray's ' Catalogus Plant.
Anglian' (1670), where 
the author adds that he had seen it ten years before near Norwich, and 
that Mr. Needham reported it abundant and wild in Cheshire (p.
7).
It appears, then, as far as history goes, that Acorns Calamus was un- 
known in this country before 1596, when Gerarde had it in his garden, 
and that it was not till about 1660 that it was reported as a wild plant 
from Norfolk.
We have therefore to consider whether it is more pro- 
bable that, being a common garden plant, it should have become natura- 
lized, or that it was overlooked in the wild state by all the herbalists who 
botanized in England before 1660.
But a few other data may be 
brought to bear on the question.
The plant possesses no English name 
of any antiquity, the name proposed by Johnson given above being the 
only one ever used and is indeed that still employed, omitting the word 
"garden." I have not, however, been able to ascertain whether there is 
any iond-fi.de Welsh name.
On the other hand, the aspect of the species, 
when seen growing round the ponds and by the streams of the Thames 
valley, is quite that of a native, and gives oue no reason to doubt its spon- 
taneity ; it has all the look of an integral part of the native vegetation.
In the case of a water-loving species, however, too much stress must not be 
laid upon this fact — Lnpatieus fnlva, which grows along with it, has au 
equally English appearance, though a certainly introduced plant of a 
* Pallas, on the ticket to the specimens in his herbarivnn now in tlie British 
Museum, gives some information about the preparation of the rhizome, and its 
extensive use iu diarrhoea, in the regions near the Caspian, where the plant is 
very abundant.
IS ACORDS CALAMUS A NATIVE.

recent date.
Dr. Hooker states, in liis ' Student's Flora,' tliat lie has not 
seen tlie fruit of Acorus, and I am myself in a similar case, but I have 
not made a speeial search.
Dr. Boswell-Syrae describes it in 'English 
Botany,' but does not say if from British specimens.
The bearing of these various data seems to me to be against the 
nativity of Acorns Calamus in England.
The plant is certainly not a 
showy or conspicuous one, and might be passed over by an ordinary 
observer, though its peculiar and powerful odour when bruised, readily 
makes its presence known even to them, and its singularity of appearance 
then becomes striking.
It may be said, I think, with certainty that such, 
good observers as Turner, Lobel, Clusius, Gerarde, Parkinson, and Johnson, 
not to [nention others whose names are, from not being authors, less known, 
could not have passed by so singular a plant, — familiar, too, to all but 
Turner in the garden, and to which a special interest attached, from the 
uncertainty and confusion prevniling as to the right name of its then 
much-esteemed rhizome.
Besides this, we know how readily Acorus is 
established if planted in a suitable situation, and how rapidly such 
aquatic species will extend themselves throughout a river basin.
More- 
over, in this case there was a direct incentive to assist this, for the root 
bore a good price both as a drug and also among the brewers as a flavour- 
ing for beer.
It is, indeed, generally admitted to have been planted in 
not a few of its stations ; and as definite statements on such subjects are 
rarely put on record, it is well to say here that Dr. J.
E. Gray, of the 
Britisii ]\Iuseum, tells me, that the late Mr. Wiieeler,* of the Apothe- 
caries' Company, planted it extensively about London, and that Dr. Gray 
himself saw this done at the well-known locality at Lord INIansfield's, 
Highgate (see 'Flora of Middlesex,' p.
291).
It would seem still more 
likely for the older apothecaries to act in this manner, and they probably 
did so ; though, even without this direct interference of man, the Acorus 
might readily become established on a river-bank in proximity to gardens 
(as at Fulham, the first locality recorded for Middlesex), from the rhi- 
zomes being thrown out with garden-rubbish.
Devos tells us that in 1590 and 1591 Sebitz naturalized it at Strasburg, 
and J.
Bauhin at Belfort, and that in 1710 it had become abundant in 
Alsace, though wanting in France, where, indeed, it is still rare.
We 
have seen that it was a little earlier in cultivation in Belgium, but there 
is no definite record of its having been intentionally planted in wild loca- 
lities there.
In conclusion, when we find the history of the plant in western Europe 
generally agreeing so closely with that in England, we must, I think, 
allow that tlic case for Acorns as a native becomes still further weakened.
Indeed, all the facts about the plant seem to point to south-east Europe 
and adjacent parts of Asia as the home of Acorus Calaiiius, and to a pro- 
pagation westward by means of cultivation in botanic gardens ; whilst, 
as far as Great Britain is concerned, it probably originated from Gerarde's 
garden in Ilolborn, whither it may have been brought from Belgium by 
his friend Lobel.
* This Mr. Wheeler sowed and planted many rare species at Hampstead, in 
the wood called usually Turner's Wood.

ON THE PHYLLOTAXIS OP LEPIDODENDRON AND THE 
ALLIED, IF NOT IDENTICAL, GENUS KNORRIA.
By Professor Alexander Dickson.
{Read at the Meeting of the Edinburgh' Botanical Society, April 13iA, 1871.) 
The fossil remains of these plants are often so compressed that it is 
difficult, or even impossible, to trace the secondary spirals round the cir- 
cumference of the stem.
In those cases, however, where there is compa- 
ratively little compression, — i.
e. where the stem is more or less cylindrical, 
— the determination of the phyllotaxis is easy.
Of snch stems the author 
had examined thirteen specimens, which may be classed according to 
the series of spirals to which the leaf-arrangement belongs.

From the above it is evident that the phyllotaxis of Lepidodendron is 
extremely variable, as much so, perhaps, as that of those most variable

It is also clear that what has been 
enunciated by Frof.

of palaeozoic plants were arranged, viz.
that of alternate whorls, does not 
apply to these ancient Lycopods.

and little branched, occurs near Newtown on ground from which the

S. radicam, Sm. VVootton Creek (A.
G. M.).
By the West Yar 
(Dr. G.
R. Tate).
Two forms of this occur on the shores of Brad- 
ing Harbour.
On the harder mud grows a plant with a stout, central, 
woody root, often half an inch in diameter, round which spread the decum- 
bent lateral branches, which scarcely at all take root at the joints.
This, 
I believe, represents S.
fniticosn, L., and S.
Urjnom of J.
Woods, I.e.
But in the soft, pulpy mud the branches take root in all directions, while 
the original stock decays as they advance, leaving an interwoven mass of 
slender roots cieeping in aU directions.
This latter is the proper S.
radi- 
cans of Smith.
I was unable to see any difference between the seeds of 
these two forms, and I may remark that M.
Duval Jouve, in his elaborate 
paper on the French Saliconiice, published in the Bulletin of Bot. Soc.
ot 
France, vol.
xv.
p. 165 (1868), does not show any great difference be- 
tween the seeds of his tAvo species, S.
sarmeniosa {radicans of Smith) and 
S.fruticosa.
The observations of Lloyd in his ' Flore de I'Ouest,' p.

may safely claim S.

A number of specimens which I collected

I do not think either species of Elm is indigenous in the

Trees so commonly planted, whose roots run so far, and 
whose seed is so easily scattered, require stronger evidence in their favour 
than I have yet seen ; and there are in the Isle of Wight scarcely any 
upland copses where the Elm might be exjiected to occur as native.

SHOET NOTES AND QUERIES.
Plants of Staffordshire.
— In reply to the Rev. W^ A.
Leighton 
(see p.
112), I am able to state that Cannock Chase is abont 760 feet 
above the sea level, and Sutton about 450 feet.
The flora of Sutton 
Common is more boreal than alpine, I think, containing an abundance of 
Ulex europfEus, Calluna vulgaris, Erica cinerea, E.
Tetralix, with here 
and there scattered tufts of Triodia decumbens and Molinia ccerulea.
I 
also find Parnassia palustris and Jasione montana, but never abundant 
here.
The flora of Cannock Chase is much the same as that of Sutton.

PERIANTH (p.
112).
— The term 'perianth ' seems to me to be too use- 
ful to discard.
It should, however, be used as a collective term for the 
floral envelopes.
We may thus have the perianth in its perfect forai 
separable into two parts — the calyx and corolla.
Then, again, either 
the outer or inner portion may be wanting, or the two series may be 
similar, either both calyx-like, calycoid, or both more or less brightly 
coloured or corolloid.

Plants of Co. Coiik.
— Scirpus Savii ; not recorded up to this from 
District No. 2 of ' Cybele Hibernica,' but occurs abundantly in the east 
of the county.
— Carex diviilsa ; apparently a very rare plant in Ireland, 
but not unfrequent in this county.
It occurs at Midleton, and in the 
extreme west near Bantry.
— C.
Umosa ; not recorded from this county 
hitherto, but found twice by me last summer, near Glengariffe, at base of 
the Sugar Loaf, and on Bluefort Bog, Newmarket.
— C.
Jilifurmis ; stated 
by Drummond to grow in Ballyphehane Bog, near Cork, but not seen 
there lately.
I found it last summer abundantly in a lake at head of the 
Glengarifte Glen.
— C.
paludosa ; not recorded from the county.
I have 
found it here at Dumfort Bog, and again in the west near Dunmanway.

T. Allin.
Vekonic.\ triphyllos, L.
— One of my pupils lately found this in a 
cornfield near Rugby, where several other Veronicas were growing.
Its 
occurrence here so far away from the eastern counties, its proper habitat, 
seems worthy of record.

Crithmum maritimum.
— In the last number of the Journal (p.
143) 
the shingly beach at Newton Creek is called a "most unusual locality" 
for Crilhinum maritimum.
Surely this is not the case ; the plant is 
not abundant in Sussex, but I find it here and there on the beach all 
along the coast from Rye to Chichester Creek, and I have seen it in 
several similar places in other parts of England.
— W.

Applications of some Brittsh Plants.
— The Carices are not 
noted for their economic value, but in isolated country districts we may 
often see some novel application of a native product little thought of by 
the residents of large towns.
The Carex panicnlata, L., a plant growing 
in wet copses and marshes, would appear to be of no interest economi- 
cally, yet the dense tufts of this plant, which attain a large size in the 
Norfolk fens, are cut by the peasantry, and used to a certain extent in 
some parts of the county, as well as in Sussex, for kneeling-hassocks in 
churches.
They are very durable, and have been known to last over fifty 
years.
The stems of Scirpus lacnstriis and Tt/pJia intifoUa are, of course, 
more geiu;rally used, but these are plattcul, while the tufts of the Carex 
require no preparation.
In Yorkshire and Cumberland it is not uncom- 
mon for the Hair Moss, Polytrirhnm commune, to be used both for 
hassocks and brooms.
In Lapland, the natives remove large masses of 
this Moss from the ground just above the roots, ami use them for mak- 
ing beds ind for coverings instead of blankets.

Early information (not given, 1 think, in Dr. Brom-

so that, besides references to Gerarde, T can only, at present, give the

He states that he found it " on a rock overhanging 
the water about a quarter of a mile below the fall " at St. Knighton's 
Kieve, on the northern coast of the county, in August, 1867.
In the 
succeeding year, during a hurried visit, he was unable to see it.
In the 
next number of ' Nature,' (vol.
iv.
p. 8,) Mr. W.
P. Dymond, of Fal- 
mouth, corroborates the fact, and adds that the Fern was first recognized 
at the spot by Mr. R.
W. Fox, in 1866.
Mr. iin Thurn has kindly 
communicated to me some additional details.
The waterfall in question 
is about two miles from Tintagel Castle, and the same distance from 
Boscastle ; a single patch only was seen, and the fronds were probably 
not much over two inches in height.
He has no doubt of the identity of 
the plant, but, being separated from his herbarium, is unable at present 
to submit the only frond he gathered to my examination.
With reference 
to the probabilities of its introduction at the fall, Mr. im Thurn writes: 
- — " The rocks about the waterfall are exactly of the kind on which the 
Trichomanes usually grows, and if there is any one in the neighbourhood 
with a taste for the cultivation of Ferns they may, of course, have tried 
the experiment of introducing the plant.
Again, the waterfall, which is 
romantic enough to attract many visitors, is, with a certain amount of 
ground round it, enclosed, and let to a man who makes a show of it.
The Ferns of other species growing about the fall are remarkable for 
their great luxuriance, and are much admired l)y visitors, A smattering 
of fern-lore being so common amongst tourists, it is by no means impos- 
sible that the lessee of the waterfall may have attempted to add to its 
attractions by planting rare Ferns.
Notwithstanding all this, my own 
impression is that it was not an introduced plant, for which opinion my 
reasons are as follows : Firstly, the plant was not growing close to the 
waterfall, the part generally visited, but some little way down the stream, 
almost, if not quite, beyond the range of ordinary visitors.
Secondly, it 
is scarcely probable that a man who has to repay himself for a heavy rent 
by the fees obtained from visitors during the short suunner season would 
be able to expend much in plants as rare, expens've, and insignificant as 
the TrlcJtumnnes, especially since it would be passed unnoticed by all but a 
few of his customers.
Thirdly, and lastly, the plant showed no visible 
signs of introduction, and was of the wild form, and not of that slightly 
different form which it assumes under cultivation." Under these circum- 
SHOUT NOTES AND QUERIES.
175 
stances, it will be best for the piesent to withhold from the TricJio- 
maues an unqualified admission into the flora of Cornwall.
Tliere is, 
however, undoubted evidence of its existence in England at a time pre- 
vious to the introduction of the popular taste for Fern culture.
In tiie 
first volume of this Journal (p.
238), attention was drawn by Mr. T.
Moore to Dr. Richardson's specimens from Bingley, Yorkshire, in the 
British Museum ; and in the Banksian herbarium there is another speci- 
men from "Belbank, Yorkshire" (the same locality), collected by Hud- 
son.
These Yorkshire plants are but an inch or two high.
Tliere are 
also in the Museum very luxuriant specimens from Carnarvonshire, col- 
lected in 18G3 by Mr. Backhouse.
In this locality, however, there is 
reason to suspect an intentional introduction, as is also the case in the 
parallel habitats in Westmoreland and Arran, recorded in this Journal, 
Vol. I.
pp.
238 and 293, and Argyle, given in Watson's 'Compendium,' 
p. 604.
The county of "Derbyshire" is mentioned in ' Nature' (vol.
iii.
p. 333) as formerly producing this rare Pern, but I suspect some error in 
this.
Still, tliere is sufficient probability of coming upon Trichomanes in 
a wild state in England to render worth while a special search in suitable 
localities.

— In continuation of my remarks (Vol. VIII.

(cf.

I find no mention of Isle of Wight plants in Blackstone, 'Spe- 
cimen Botanicura ' (174(j), nor do I come across any record in Dr. W.
G. 
Maton's 'Scenery of the Western Counties of Enoland ' (1797), nor in 
J. Hassell's 'Tour of the Isle of Wight' (1790).
There is a like silence 
in W.
Gilpin's ' Observations on the Western Parts of England, relative 
chiefly to Picturesque Beauty, to which are added a few Remarks on the 
Picturesque Beauties of the Isle of Wight' (1798).
Richard Warner, in 
his 'Collections for the History of Hampshire,' etc.
(in six vols., 1795),

the authority of the ' Magna Britannia,' and JShrcnrialis annua (vol.
iii.
p. 34), from Gough's 'Camden.' I come now to tlie ' Rural Economy 
of the Southern Counties, comprising .
. .
the Isle of Wight,' etc., by 
W. Marshall (1798).
This author writes (vol.
ii.
p. 254), " Out of the 
face of the cliit" (near St. Catherine's) shrubs and herbaceous plants are 
seen in great abundance, and to the eye glancing over them the species 
appear numerous." Then, on p.
280, he remarks, "The most extraordi- 
nary circumstance which arose in examining the crops of the Isle of Wight 
is, that not an acre, nor even a plant of Sainfoin, met the eye !
Even on 
the whole extent of calcareous lands that I traversed!
I do not mean to 
assert that there is no one instance of Sainfoin being grown in the island ; 
but, from the inquiries made, I learnt that there was, in 1791, very little, 
if any, then growing 1 And the reason given for this neglect of it was, 
tiiat ' it soon goes off;' an extraordinary circumstance (seeing the nature 
of the soil), which is only to be explained in the calcareous lands of this 
island having been re|)eatedly cro])ped with this valu.ible plant, or by 
some impropriety in the management of the growing crop." (Compare 
Mr. A.
G. More on this plant, p.
140.) On p.
287, we find "The 
Turnip crop is shamefully inanaged in this island ; not one acre often

appears to have been hoed.
To-day I saw a waggon load of Charlock an 
acre, where Turnips were doubtless intended ; and yesterday not a less 
burden of the common Bugloss {Lycopsis arvensis)." 1 now pass on to 
the ' Delineator, or a Picturesque, Historical, and Topographical Descrip- 
tion of the Isle of Wight,' by James Clarke (2nd edition, 1814; 6th 
edition, 1824).
In this we have, "The Bee and Fly Orchis are found 
near Carisbrooke Castle and several other places in the island" (2nd edition, 
p. 77; 6th edition, p.
68); also, "there are several at Sir William Fitz- 
william Barrington's, Bart., Swainston." The Digitalis and Eock- 
samphire are also mentioned in both editions.
Englefield's ' Isle of 
Wight' (1816) is mostly concerned with the geological aspect of the 
island, but on p.
53 he writes: — " The observation of the sudden changes 
of the whn^e look of the vegetation, correspondent to the changes of tiie 
subsoil, which Dr. Maton, in his ' Western Tour,' mentions with the de- 
tail of an experienced botanist, had occurred to me constantly in my 
different tours in the island, and had guided me in a very instructive 
manner as to the succession and limits of the different subsoils, where no 
openings of the ground were to be found to aid research.
The geologist 
would do wtll to pay constant attention to such indicaiions ; and there is 
something peculiarly pleasing in seeing sciences not apparently related 
thus mutually tending to the advancement of both.
How false and con- 
temptible is the supercilious pride of liira who dares despise even the 
most apparently trifling observation on, or humble investigation of, the 
great and infinitely varied spectacle of nature!" My last quotation con- 
sists of the last sentence in the description of the Isle of Wight by Eobert 
Mudie, Hampshire (vol.
iii.
I. of W.
p. 226), 1838 :— " The botany and 
zoology of the Isle of Wight present nothing peculiar." I have not been 
able to consult J.
Albin's ' Isle of Wight Magazine ' (1799) ; W.
Cooke's 
'Picture of the Isle of Wight' (1813);^nor John Stnrch's 'Isle of 
Wight' (1791).
In conclusion, I hope to make some further remarks 
on the modern condition of the flora, when Mr. A.
G. More's valuable 
paper has been completed.

Luminous Fungi.- — Two years ago I had some specimens of luminous 
fungi sent to me from the Cardiff coal-mines ; they were parasitic on the 
shoring timbers, and both fungi and mycelium were phosphorescent.
The 
colliers in the coal-mines of the western boundary of Glamorganshire and 
adjoining Caermarthenshire are well acquainted with these phosphorescent 
fungi, and the men state that they give sufficient light to " see their hands 
by." In another coal-mine, seven miles north of Cardiff, some colliers 
told Mr. William Adams that they had seen lights on the timber when 
travelling in tlie dark, and one of them said he was much frightened the 
first time he saw them.
The luminous fungi sent to me from these mines 
were specimens of Folyporus annonus, Fr., and they could be seen in the 
dark at a distance of twenty yards.
I have also seen P.
snlfnreus, Fr., 
phosphorescent, and Mr. Broome has met with a luminous Corticium.
I 
have heard that C.
cfendeuni, Fr., is sometimes luminous.
Berkeley says 
that Ayaricna (Crepicfotus) olearius, Fr., a para'-ite of Olive-trees, is some- 
times so luminous in the south of France that letters may be distinginshed 
by its light.
A short time since I had a dried Agaric (probably a 
Collybia) given me through Professor Ciiurch, of Cirencester, which was 
phosphorescent when gathered ; it came from a cellar in Oxford Street.

The luiiiinous fungus referred to iu the March number of ' Science Gossip,' 
seems to be tlie same with Ayarlcm Gardneri, Berk., an interesting 
account of which was laid before the Linnean Society in 1869, in a letter 
from Mr. Collingwood.
The writer stated that this species in Borneo 
could be distinctly seen in the dark, shining with a soft pale greenish 
light ; the older specimens were described as possessing a greenish lumi- 
nous glow, like the glow of the electric discharge.
The mycelium of this 
species, like the mycelium of Tolyporus minosus, Fr., mentioned above, 
was luminous.
It was stated that Mr. Hugh Low had once seen the 
jungle all in a blaze of light, liy which he could see to read as he was 
riding across the island by jungle road.
Several other species are men- 
tioned as phosphorescent in Berkeley's ' Introduction to Cryptogamic 
Botany,' p.
265.
I have several times observed flowers to be luminous, 
especially during certain atmospheric conditions in midsummer ; such in- 
stances as the luminosity of stale fish, potatoes, etc., are of course known 
to every one.
A year or two ago, when returning home through Epping 
Forest at night, after a long day's excursion, I saw a very luminous 
object on the ground in the distance ; on nearing it I found it to be a 
dead rat, which I brought home in my vasculum, and laid on the garden 
bed, where it preserved its luminosity for several nights.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OE THE BOTANICAL 
EXCHANGE CLUB FOR THE YEAR 1870.
{Revised hy the Author^ 
I regret to have to notice this year a Lirge increase in the proportion 
of non-contributing members to those who send parcels.
I would beg 
to suggest to the members that an increase of contributing members is 
essential to the continuance of the Exchange Club, and I would urge 
thera to try and enrol new contributors among their friends, so as to 
enlarge as much as possible the area from which plants can be collected 
for distribution.
Great credit, for the numerous interesting species 
sent, is due to those who have collected plants for the club this year, 
among which the following are the most deserving of notice : —

I do 
not recollect that this local plant has been recorded from the Loch above 
mentioned, though it has been long known to grow in the Loch of 
Menteith, in the same county, about five or six miles distant from 
Loch Lubnaig.

" Some scores of plants were seen in two clover 
fields in Surrey, about a dozen miles apart ; one being at Pirford, the 
other at Frimley.
As I had never, before 1870, been within half a mile

limited to that year.

leaves of the flowering stage.
This plant is plentiful in various spots 
along the course of the Thames, in Surrey and Middlesex, where it has 
been perfectly established for many years.
A doubt of its original nati- 
vity there is suggested by the fact that it seldom (if ever) spreads more 
than very short distances from the river into the neighbouring fields.
Except in the constantly thin and stringy root, it scarcely differs from 
the cultivated Turnip.
In other respects it appears to have closer affinity 
with the Turnip than it has with the Wild Navew, or Brassica.

A well-marked form which

The 
branches are apparently not spinous, the leaves small, about an inch long, 
oval, acuminate, rounded at the base, finely crenate-serrate, very slightly 
puljcscent beneath and on the margins when young, glabrous when mature.
Flowers small, about f inch across, in a cyme, of which the rachis is 
often &o elongated that it becomes somewhat racemose.
Calyx densely 
and finely woolly.
Styles a little shorter than the stamens.
Fruit f to |- 
inch long, roundish-turbinate, abruptly narrowed into the long pedicel.
I propose the name of Briggsii for this form if it be really destitute of a 
name.

Mr. Duthie has settled the point of there being two 
forms of P.
scandica in Arran, one of which has the leaves with none of 
the segments separated, the other, with some of the h aves pinnate at least 
towards the base.
All the specimens which he found in one glen belonged 
to the fornifr, and all those in an adjacent glen to the other.
He had an 
opportunity of tasting the fruit of both, and found it to be sweet.
Fries 
thinks this the best mode of discriminating the pinnatifid variety of Sorbus 
scandica from Sorbus fennica, Fries, of which the fruit is acid.
The Arran 
plant appears to be a subspecies different from that of the .south-west of 
England, which has been sent by Mr. T.

Ilieracium dubinvi, Linn.
Dr. Roy sends a specimen of a Hieracium

on a piece of waste ground near that town.
I believe it to be the plant 
formerly named by Fries, H.
collinum, but which he now considers to 
be the true H.
diibium of Linnaeus.
The periclines of the only Forres 
specimen I have seen are smaller, the peduncles longer, and the leaves 
on the stolons less developed than in the ordinary form of the Scan- 
dinavian //.
duhiuni ; but Fries states that it is even more protean and 
polymorphous than the very variable tl.
prceaUum, which it replaces in 
colder countries.
I cannot, therefore, speak with certainty as to the name 
of the Forres plant until I have seen a series of specimens.

" Notes on

W. Andrews.
In the course of the paper, the following reinarks were inci- 
dentally made on the two British species : — It has often much surprised me 
that British botanists are so persistent in making H.
mnlaterale the true 
representative of H.
Wilso)n, for I venture to assert that few have ever 
possessed truly authenticated specimens of H.
unilultraleoi Willdenow and 
of Bory St. Vincent, and none to have seen living specimens.
//.
7ini- 
Inlerale seems altogether to be confined to the Island of Bourbon, where 
alone it was met with and described by Bory St. Vincent.
Of H.
uni- 
lateralc of New Zealand, the spreading frond more nearly approaches II.
tunhrichjense, but the fruit, with even and entire involucres, is similar to 
that of H.
Wihoni, with the exception that the lips of the involucre are 
broader and not ovate.
I have been favoured with a specimen of the true 
H. umlateraU from Reunion, obtained by Dr. Meller.
It unfortunately 
has no involucres, yet the character of the pinnules of the frond are dis- 
tinct both from H.
tiinbridgtnse and H.
Jrilwni.
I expect better speci- 
mens.
In the meantime, I will give the account of one who has taken 
much interest in the study of Ferns, especially those of the Mauritius, 
from which place the communication is sent.
The extract, which is 
very clear and pleasingly written, is from a letter sent to a lady in this 
city, who is much interested in the suhiect:—".IIi/viei/ojjI/i/ll/tm unila- 
terale does not grow in Mauritius, but in the neighbouring Island 
of Bourbon (Reunion), and none has been found there since 1835, so 
that there was some difficulty in procuring a specimen.
Tins, however, 
has been managed with the aid of Dr. Meller, the Director of the Botanic 
Gardens here, who was in Reunion when your letter arrived, and who 
succeeded in getting me an authentic specimen, named by Bory St.
Vincent himself, which I now send to you, together with a 'iew of our 
Mauritius Ili/meiiopliylleae and Tricliomanes, as they may interest you or 
your friends.
Sir Henry (Barkly) and myself, in concert with Dr. Meller, 
carefully examined H.
uiiilfilerale, and we came to the conclusion that it 
decidedly differs from the description given of H.
JFilsoni by Hooker in 
his ' Species Filicum,' i.

except just at the apex of the segments, while the latter is described 
as having the margin " toothed or spiuuloso-serrate." The cells, too, 
"which Dr. Meller examined with a microscope, are sufficiently distinct 
from those of II.

It also appears to differ widely from the description given of 
H. tnvhriJgeiise, to which Sir William Hooker referred a specimen of 
H. imilaterale, sent by Willdenow (tvV/e ' Species Filicum').
We have not

a distinct species, though whether the same honour can be given to 
H. miilaterale, or whether it is only a peculiar form of some of the 
Bourbon varieties, remains to be proved.
Sir Henry and Dr. Meller 
both incline, I think, to the latter opinion, as several of the Hynwnophylhfe 
from Reunion have a decided tendency to a unilateral character, and I 
enclose one specimen of //.

I am more than ever confirmed in the truly distinctive characters of

those of the yellow practically so, but the violet-blue were unaffected.

— Professor Ball in the chair.
Dr. Moore, Director of the Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, made a commu- 
nication relative to the loss of the fine plant of Pandauns id'dis, Bory, 
which had until recently been one of the most conspicuous ornaments of 
the palm-house.
Dr. Moore had personally had the plant under his care 
for thirty-three years, and it was certainly not less than twenty years old 
when he first knew it.
It was about twenty-five feet in height, and had 
reached a size at which its flowering might be looked forward to with 
some certainty.
All such hopes were, however, frustrated by the fungoid 
disease to which the plant eventually succumbed.
This first showed its 
effects in the stem immediately beneath one of the crowns, destroying the 
rigidity and cohesion of the tissues, so that the crown drooped downwards.
Tiie crown was removed, and an attempt made to propagate it, but the 
external symptoms of dis(!ase which the plant exiiil)ite(l were only too 
evidently the final result of the not inunediately apparent internal ravages 
of a mycelium, and the crown, like the rest of the plant, was already 
doomed.
Successive portions of the difl'erent axes were amputated, but 
.without, in any way, averting the mischief.
Dr. Moore stated that the 
fungus was identical with that which had destroyed the Pandauns odora- 
Imim/ts, Jaccp, in the gardens at Breslau, and of which there was an 
account in Coim's ' Beitriige ' by Dr. Schrceter.
The diseased parts of the 
plant exhibited several fungoid forms, which there was good reason to 
believe were polymorphic stites of the same plant ; of these Melaiicoruiini 
Pandaui, Lev., and Neclria Pandani, Tul., had been described.* Dr.
Moore stated that there was no reason to attribute the death of the

would be more fitting that British Floras should include the score or so

should be destroyed by the admission of thirty or more species absent 
from Great Britain and Ireland, but found in the Channel Islands, the

ON BRASSICA POLTMORPHA, Si/me.
By W.
T. Thiselton Dyer, B.A., B.Sc.
In two papers in this Journal (vii.
346-350 ; viii.
869-372) Mr. H.
C. 
Watson has described a Brasska which occurs by the Thames-side in 
Surrey and Middlesex, and which he believes to be B.
campestris, L.
; 
understanding by that name the " wild stock of the Turnip." In the 
' Flora of Middlesex ' (p.
35) this plant was erroneously placed under 
B. Naptis, L.
; an error which arose from Dr. Trimen and myself having, 
in the absence of such opportunities as Mr. Watson possesses of ex- 
amining the winter-tufts, followed Dr. Boswell S^-me, who had recorded 
under that name plants from the Thames-side.
Mr. Watson has, how- 
ever, abundantly demonstrated that the Thames-side Brassica is perfectly 
distinct from B.
Nap/i-i, and that it is in fact what, adopting the characters 
given by De Candolle (Syst.
Nat.), Smith (Eng. FL), Boswell Svme, 
(Eng. Bot.), Hooker (Stud.
EL), and Boreau (Fl. du Cent, de la *Fr.), 
would be called a wild state of B.
Rapa, L.
A perfectly distinct question, therefcu'e, from the identity of the 
Thames-side species is raised by Mr. Watson with respect to the syno- 
nymy of the other plants allied to it.
Hitherto, most systematic books 
in this country have included three allied species o{ Brassica admitting of 
being distinguished by characters drawn from their radical leaves.
Using 
the language of De Candolle (Reg. Veg.
Syst.
Nat. ii.
588-592), these 
characters may be stated as follows : — 
B. cajiipeslris, foliis polline glaucis inferioribus novellis subhispidis.
B. Rapa, foliis radicalibus lyratis polline glauco destitutis setoso- 
scabris, 
B. Napus, foliis glabris polline csesio glaucescentibus.
Substantially the same characters are given by Smith (Eng. Fl.
iii.
217, 
218) ; who, however, also describes campestris as having radical leaves, 
only " rather glaucous, rough all orer\x'\i\\ minute bristly hairs ' (p.
219), 
which looks as if he were not wholly free from some confusion between 
this plant and his Rapa.
Lindley ('Synopsis') merely quotes Smith.
Sir 
VV.
Hooker (Brit.
Fl. 308) refers to Smith, and has the same arrange- 
ment, but does not mention the green radical leaves of B.
Rapa, distin- 
guishing it from B.
carnpeslris by its fleshy root instead.
Boreau gives 
the sane characters as De Candolle.
The nomenclature of probably all modern English writers, who have 
treated of the economic aspect of these plants, is borrowed from 
De Candolle's determinations.
Unless on very urgent grounds, it would 
be hardly desirable to alter this.
The reform, unfortunately, of scientific 
terms wliich have got into popular use rarely has any other effect than to 
make both old and new ambiguous and useless.
The old and erroneeus 
meanings continue to survive alongside with the new and correct ones.
It is always best, when popular use has spoiled a term, to Icive it to its 
fate, accept it in its erroneous sense, and, if necessary, invent a new 
word to do its proper work.
Of each of the three cultivated species of Brassica De Candolle

describes two forms; one, aimuol, with a sleutler root and rapid produo- 
tiou of seeds, lending itself to the purposes of the oil-expresser ; the 
other, biennial, with a root which is enlarged and escident.
Probably, a 
succulent-rooted variety of almost any plant with anything- like a biennial 
habit, might be obtained by patient cidtivation and selection.
Turnip- 
rooted forms of Chervil {Authriscus CerefoUum, Hotfm.) and Parsley 
(Pefroseliiiitm sativum, Hofim.) may be bought in the shops ; even the 
wild Radish {RaplumusRaplianldrum, L.) has been made in France, as a 
matter of experiment, to yield an esculent root.
Generally speaking, a 
generous supply of food tends to develope the leafy or nutritive organs of 
such plants, and checks the evolution of the reproductive organs — or, what 
is in biennials practically the same thing, the growth of the ascending- 
axis.
Hence these plants when stinted in their food, as when growing 
amongst standing crops, rapidly run up and attain maturity ; or, in 
other words, are apt to become annuals.
B. campc'stris, De Cand.
(I.e. 588J, includes two very important agri- 
cultural plants — the Swedish Turnip and the Rape or Colza.
As far as 
my experience of these plants goes, they certainly are forms of the same 
species, only differing in the presence or absence of an enlarged root.
If 
the mature radical leaves of either form of this plant be examined both 
will seem almost glabrous, and it is only by a careful scrutiny of the ribs 
on the uuder surface that a few scattered cartilaginous hairs can be 
detected ; the young leaves are, however, quite obviously hispid.
It is 
worth while remarking that externally there is a wade difference between 
the root of the Swede and the ordinary Turnip, which is well known to 
agriculturists.
The Turnip, whether globe or tankard {depres&d or obJoucja) 
has the crown of leaves sessile without any elongation of the iuternodes.
The Swede, which, without being oblong is straight-sided in its middle, 
has its upper portion prolonged into a "neck" marked by the scars, 
separated by partially developed iuternodes of the decayed lower leaves of 
the crown.
Of the history of the Swedish Turnip (var.
Napo-Brasslca, 
De Cand.) almost nothing seems to be known.
De Candolle remarks, 
that possibly it may be a hybrid between B.
campedrh (Rape) and B.
Rapa ; and Mr. Buckman states " that the seeding of Rape and common 
Turnips in mixed rows has resulted in the production of malformed 
Swedes ; which, however, improved very much by careful cultivation " 
('Treasury of Botany,' p.
165).
Lamarck, struck probably with the 
character of the iieek, observes that the Swede is a variety in the same 
race as the Chou-rave {B.
oleracea, var.
cnnlo-rapa, De Cand.), the Kohl- 
rabi of English seedsmen ; and this would be pretty nearly the opinion of 
LinuEeus, if, as it seems probable, De Candolle is right in quoting, as a 
synonym of the Swede, B.
oleracea, var.
Napo-Brassica, L.
(Sp. 932), 
identified with J3.
Napus, var.
y. escidenla by Kocli, who seems to include 
the hispid Rape as well as the Swede under Napus.
One variety of the 
Swede has large entire cabbage-like leaves (Wilson, ' Farm Crops,' i.
275).
Mr. Watson, in his second paper, remarks that " Turnip and Swede are 
species about as distinct from each other as Swede and Cabbage " 
(viii.
370).
He is certainly correct in contrasting the larger and pale 
orange-coloured flowers of the Swede with the bright buttercup yellow of 
the Turnip.
Hybrids permanent in their characters have been obtained 
between the Swede and the White Turnip, and are quoted in seedsmen's 
lists.
It cannot be doubted that both Swede and Rape must often occur 
ON BRASSICA POLYMOKPHA.
195 
subspontaneously as the remains of cultivation ; and, probably, often 
figure in herbaria and local lists as B.
campestris.
B. Riipn, De Cand., the Turnip in its esculent rooted state, falls into 
two I'aces, which have always been distinguished in books, — the varieties 
depressa and ohlonga of De Candolle, Besides these, a slender-rooted 
form, cultivated as an oil plant in Dauphiny, was ascertained by experi- 
ment, in the Geneva Botanic Garden, to belong to this species, and must, 
therefore, be the same as the Thames-side Brassica.
B. Napus, De Cand., is probably almost unknown in this country.
I 
have examined fields of llape in Gloucestershire, and have always found 
the young leaves to be hispid.
1 conclude, therefore, that this could not 
be Napiis.
In Forster's Herbarium in the British Museum there is a 
young plant of, I presume, this species, as the leaves, as far as I could 
see, are quite glabrous.
This is the only example I have come across.
Mr. Watson speaks of Rape Avith the synonym Napus in his paper 
(viii.
271).
If this is correct, which I do not think it to be, B.
Napus 
ought to occur as a waif of cultivation, at any rate, in sheep-farming dis- 
tricts.
In the ' Cybele ' (i.
IfiO), however, he says, " I have never seen — 
at least, never recognized — the species." It is apparently cultivated on 
the Continent both as an oil- and root-yielding plant.
Its root, called 
" navet," is often coufouiuled with the Tankard Turni)i, but seems to 
have been generally pretty clearly distinguished (Cf. R'lpum obloiifjius and 
Napus, Dod. Pempt.
673, 674).
It is a common vegetable in Continen- 
tal gardens, though apparently hardly, if ever, cultivated in England.
If we turn to the diagnoses of these plants given by LiiuicTus, while 
there is no difficulty in determining what is meant by his B.
Rapa and 
B. Napus, the identity of his B.
campestris is very uncertain ; in fact, all 
that can be certainly stated of it is, that it was a troublesome weed in 
parts of Sweden.
The description merely states that it had a slender 
root and uniform cordate sessile leaves.
The synonyms given in the 
' Hortus Cliftbrtianus ' (p.
339), to which reference is made, apparently 
belong to either Erysmiim or'ieidale, Br., or E.
auslriacum, Jacq.
; and 
Lamarck has united the former species { ^= Brassica orieutulis, L ) with B.
campestris, L., which he considers tlie same as E.
austriacitm, Jacq., 
under the name of B.
perfoliata (Kncyc.
Method.).* Mr. Watson believes 
B. campestris to be tlie wild and slender-rooted tbrm of B.
Rapa, the 
same, in fact, as the Dauphiny plant of De Candolle; and he remarks 
that Grenier and Godron follow Lamarck in using the expressive name 
asperifoUa for the aggregate species, making campestris, L., its type-form, 
and Rapa, L., the esculent-rooted variety.
But Lamarck, in the ' Encv- 
clopedie Methodique ' rather unintelligibly joins not campestris, but Napus 
to Rapa, notwithstanding that Linna3us states Napus to have glabrous 
leaves.
Koch also (Syn. Fl.
Germ, ed.
2. i.
59) considers B.
campestris, 
L., to be an annual variety of B.
Rapa, and the same as B.
prcecox.

troublesome weed in Sweden, it could not be Urysimnm orienlale, Br.
; and 
Koch, Babington and Watson may be right, as far as the evidence from 
books goes, in looking upon it as a wald state of Rupa.
The authentic 
specimens, however, in the Linnpean Herbarium, although not very satis- 
factory, will hardly support this view.
Two sheets are named " cam- 
pestris ; " the first contains a " top," and an indeterminate example of an 
annual plant, apparently the same as that on the second sheet.
This last 
is about a foot in height, in flower (the inflorescence decidedly corymbose 
where the petals are still unfallen), yet still preserving the radical leaves.
These lower leaves are only sparingly hispid, the pairs being confined to 
tlie ribs, and they are also distinctly ghiucous ; in fact, they appear to me 
quite the same in appearance as those of a young seedling Swede sent me 
by Mr. Watson.
The young leaves of the Thames-side Brassica are not 
in the least glaucous, and are, as Mr. Watson says, " much hispid," the 
hairs being by no means conTined to the ribs.
The Smithian Herbarium 
yields little information, as none of the specimens have young leaves.
The cmnpestris of the Linnsean herbarium and of Mr. Watson appear, 
therefore, by no means to be the same thing.
The Swedisli plant seems 
to be nearly allied to the Swede and the Rape of English agriculturists ; 
the Thames-side plant is indubitably a wilding Turnip.
The only question 
remains, how is the existing nomenclature to be adjusted to our English 
plants.
The first step would be to eliminate B.
Najjus ; apparently, as 
far as England is concerned, a purely spectral plant, if one with wholly 
glabrous radical leaves is intended.
Koch retains Napns, including under 
it the plants of De Candolle's campedris, making, as stated above, the 
campeatrls of Linnseus, a variety of Eapa.
Napus, at any rate, has only a 
prescriptive right to a place in English Floras.
As to the name 'polymotpha,' Boswell Syme, by a curious error, says 
(Eng. Bot.
i. 136) that he gives it to the aggregate species " in pre- 
ference to B.
cmnpestris, as that name has been applied exclusively to the 
' form with glabrous (not hispid) radical leaves," which is apparently the 
opposite of the fact.
Dr. Hooker, however (' Student's Flora,' p.
29), con- 
siders that B.
polymorpha should not supersede B.
campestris.
The synonymy of these plants would seem to stand as follows : —

As a curious case of what has been styled mimicry in vegetation, I

It is called Saxce

at first sight it uiight be taken for it, especially when not in flower.

Goering, an ornithological traveller, who lately visited the

The few names printed in small capitals refer to plants that occur also in

The large collections made i)y Linden, Funk, Schlim,

this result, which is to be expected as a consecpieuce of the geogmphical 
position.
I may be allowed to add that Mr. Goering found the Myroxy- 
lon toluiferum near .Turaras (west of Puerto Cabello), and forwarded 
specimens to Dan. Hanbury, Esq., of London.
Dr. Seemann had noticed 
the tree in 1864 on the Tocuyo river.

Teratological Remarks.
— I have seen some fruits o^ Persea 
gratissima, Geertn., which had no seed, containing instead of it a watery 
liquid.
I was told that the tree they were taken from (on an estate near 
La Guaira) never had produced normal fruits.
Pasciation occurs not 
seldom in the spikes of StacJiyfurpha jamaiceusis ; syncarpy is not unfre- 
quent in Musa sapitnium.
llippocratea comosa is an example of the 
complete suppression of the flower (comp.
Masters, * Teratology,' p.
409).
An instance of the fission of stamens came lately under my notice ; one of 
the stamens in Crinum amabde was nearly wholly divided in two.
The 
case of pleiotaxy of the gyncecium \\\i\\eora)ige, mentioned by Masters (1.
c. 
p. 389), is pretty common here.
The people call these fruits " naranjas 
paridas," i.
e. oranges lately delivered.

NOTES IN JERSEY AND GUERNSEY.
By Henry Trim en, M.B., P.L.S.
I spent the last Aveek of April, 1871, in the Channel Islands, four days 
in Jersey and two in Guernsev, liavinj^ the advanta'^c of Mr. P.
Stratton's 
NOTES IN JERSEY AND GUERNSEY.
199 
companionship in the former island ; and have put together my jottings 
about some of the more interesting members of the flora, in the belief 
that few British botanists have examined the spring vegetation.
At this season, the botany of the tracts of sandy ground near the sea 
best repays attention.
It consists of a dwarf vegetation of numerous 
species, and great beauty.
The prevalent species in flower in such plac(:S 
during my visit to Jersey were CochUaria danica, Mcenchia erecta, Sagina 
apetala vera, Arenai'ia serjjyUifolla vera, Ccrastmm sem.idecandnim, Orni- 
thopiis pe7'pnsilliis, Alchemilla arvensis, Saxrfrarja tridactyUtes, Valerla- 
nella oUtoria and V.
carinata, Myosotis colUiu, Plantago Goronopns, 
Carex arenaria, and a maritime state of Bromus mollis, all of very small 
size.
These formed the bulk of the close turf; but scarcely less abundant 
were Cnpsella Bursa-pastoris, Teesdalia nndlcatd'is, Arabls ThaJiaiia, 
Draba verna mojuacnla, Stellaria Boraava, Erodinm cicutarium, Trifuliuiti 
siibterraneum and T.
minus, Vicia angnsiifolia and V.
lathyroides, Myosotis 
versicolor, Phleum arenarium and Mibora minima, the last varying consi- 
derably in size and in the colour of the glumes.
Equally connnou was a 
dwarf Pansy, which agrees well with the description of V.
nemausensis, 
Jord.
in Boreau's ¥1.
du Centre, p.
S3, and with Billot's specimens so 
named, from La Kochelle (n.
1127 ter).
This seems to be the V.
tricolor, 
var.
y. mediterranea, of Gren.
and Godr.
i. 183, and is certainly the 
var.
6. nana of Lloyd's Fl. de I'Ouest, p.
70.
The petals are pale bluish- 
white, a little shorter than the sepals, and the spur blue.
A Cerastium 
was also abundant in places, which, in consequence of all the bracts being 
entirely herbaceous, I at the time considered to be C.
tetrandrum.
Curt.
; 
and Mr. Stratton and Mr. A.
G. More, who have both had opportunities 
of studying the plants of this genus in the Isle of Wight, also refer the 
Channel Islands specimens to C.
tetrandrum.
They appear, however, to 
deviate considerably from the typical tetrandrum in mode of branching as 
well as in the direction of the pedicels, and I am now inclined to place the 
plant rather under the C.
pmnilum of Curtis (= C.
obscurum, Boreau), of 
which several forms are distinguished by the French and German botanists.
I cannot, however, consider C.
pumilum specifically distinct from C.
tetran- 
drum.
Large green specimens of the Jersey plant, with elongated intcr- 
nodes, are perhaps the C.
pediinculatum of Babington, described and figured 
as a species in the second volume of the JMag. of Zool.
and Bot., but which 
lie subsequently referred to C.
tetrandrum.
Less common species noticed 
wilhthose above named were Polygala depressa, Medicago denticidata, Trifo- 
liumfiliforme, Trichonema Columna (which was in good flower and quantity 
by the second martello tower in St. Aubin's Bay), and Scilla aulumnalis, 
of course not in flower.
With the Trichonema a Ilerniaria occurred, which 
seems to me to be the ciliated form of //.
vulgaris, L., of Babington.
Dr. Boswell Syme, however, refers all plants from the Channel Islands he 
has seen to //.
ciliata, Bab., but my specimens differ in habit from 
authentic specimens of this doubtfully-distinct species from Cornwall.
The remarkable desolate tract in the west of Jersey called tlie Quenvais 
would well reward a very careful search ; a rapid walk in a straight/ line 
across it showed, besides most of the species already recorded above, 
abundance of Euphorbia Faralias and E.
portlandica, Schosnus nigricans, 
Silene conica just in flower, and plenty of Ilutckinsia petrtsa, a species not 
previously recorded for the district, though detected in very small quan- 
tity last year in some other part of the island.
Though this plant is in 
200 NOTES IN JERSEY AND GUERNSEY.
England restricted to limestone hills, it is common on sea-sand on a part 
of the coast of France adjacent to the Channel Islands (see Lloyd, p.
55).
The handsome rayed Smecio, mentioned by Boswell Syme in the fifth 
volume of ' English Botany ' (p.
80) as var.
radiatus of S.
vulgaris, made so 
great a show that it was hard to believe it merely Groundsel.
De Can- 
doUe, indeed, placed the plant as a variety of S.
Uoidus, L.
(non Sm.), of 
S. Europe, with which it agrees in its lai'ge heads, its phyllaries, and achenes, 
but diflt'ers in its weak stem, shaggy covering of wool, and more deeply- 
divided leaves.
It seems worthy of subspecitic rank.
A dwarf form of a 
capreolate Famarla was also noticed in the sand, and it was afterwards 
found in its properly-developed coiulition commonly in the island.
Tlie 
" _F.
capreolata " of Babiiigton's ' PriniitiiB El. Saru.' he afterwards (Linn.
Journ.
Bot. iv.
165) referred to F.
cot/fiisa, .lord.
Thougii 1 confess to 
being unable to distinguish the forms into which F.
cnpreolatn has been 
divided, I think the coninion Cliannel Island ])lant, whicli has large pink 
flowers, bears more resemblance to F.
BuvieI than to any other Britisli 
variety.
The other jilants of interest noticed in Jersey were these : — Raphatms 
maritimus ; the botanist who has seen the root-leaves of this in the 
Channel Islands will be scarcely likely to put it with R.
Raplmnidrum.
Sarothamnus scoparlus ; the prostrate variety described by Mr. Bailey, in 
Cornwall, was abundant on the rocks exposed to the western gales at 
L'Etac, and presented a very singular appearance, the stems spreading 
from a centre, and pressed flat against the stone, and the numerous 
flowers at their extremities forming collectively a broad golden ring.
Tillcea muscosa ; abundant close to St. Helier's.
Smyrn'mm Olnsa- 
trum ; as far as I am able to judge, this must be a native plant 
in the Channel Isles ; I think, too, with Mr. Bentham, it is so in 
the south of England near the sea.
Echinm plaidaglueum ; the root- 
leaves of this do not at all suggest a Boraginaceous plant ; the specific 
name, which may have puzzled some who have seen only the fully-grown 
plant, is excellently descriptive of them.
Orchis Morio ; this was be- 
lieved not to grow in the islands when Professor Babington published his 
' Primitise ;' we found it in some abundance on the Quenvais.
Arum, 
italicum ; this is the only Arum we saw ; Mr. Stratton recognized it at 
once from the leaves, being familiar with it in the Isle of WigTit. When 
in flower, it is very distinct-looking.
In well-developed plants the long, 
weak, pale yellowish-green spathe falls over by its own weight, and con- 
ceals the yellow spadix, but this, Mr. Stratton says, is often the case also 
Avith A.
macnlatuin in the Isle of Wight, so that it cannot be considered dis- 
tinctive.
We noticed leaves with white veins, as in the south of Europe, 
and also some with dark spots, like those of A.
viaculatum (which pro- 
bably does not occur in the islands).
Both species grow in the neigh- 
bouring parts of France, according to Lloyd.
Gymnogramma leptophylla ; 
under the able guidance of Dr. Bull, an excellent resident botanist, I saw 
three localities for this in St. Laurence parish; all were similar; the base 
of high hedgebanks of clay-slate facing the south, and concealed by larger 
vegetation.
In Guernsey, I noticed in the sandy districts most of the same 
species as in Jersey, and in addition, Arabis liirsuta, Sagiiia viarilima, 
S. ciliata, Trifulium snffocaiuhi, and Aira caryopliyllea vera.
Erodiinu 
rjioschatiiiu occurred in several wild-looking places on the east side of the

island.
In a pasture field above tlie beautiful bay called Moulin lluet I 
met with a singular variety of Rdnnncalm balhoHUH.
This is uuforLunately 
in too youno- a state, a single flower only being expanded on each phmt, 
to allow of a full description, but the characters present are, — Bulb ?niall 
(about the size of a Haricot Bean), circular on perpendicular section ; 
root-leaves on very long petioles, trifoliolate, the centre leaflet very long 
stalked; leaflets 3-sect, the segments cut into broadly linear segments; 
flowering-stem 15 in.
high, very upright, and with the leaves and calyces 
thickly covered with long, spreading white hairs, giving tlie plant a grey- 
ish colour ; peduncles not furrowed ; flowers considerably larger than 
in ordinary R.
hnlboms.
The plant looked very unfamiliar when growing, 
the leaves much resembling those of R.
chvrupliyllas, L., of S.
Europe, 
but part of its strange appearance was found to be due to the under sur- 
face of many of the leaves being infested by a filamentous substance 
(|)arasitic fungus?) of a yellowish-grey colour.
The plant does not agree 
with any of the forms described as species by Jordan in his ' Diagnoses.' 
NOTES ON PORTULACA PSAMMOTROPHA.
By H.
p. Hance, Ph.D., etc.
Twenty years ago I described, under the above name, a very handsome 
large-flowered Purshuie, found on Prata Island, in the China Sea. A 
comparison of my own extended diagnosis of this (Walp.
Ann. Bot.
Svst.
ii.
660), carefully drawn up from living specimens, which, dug up with 
their native sand, and copiously supplied with seawater, flourished luxu- 
riantly with me, with Mr. Bentham's brief character of P.
atoitralit, Endl.
(Fl. Austr.
i. 169), leaves no doubt that the two are identical.
The 
plant had hitherto oidy been met with by Robert Brown in the Gulf of 
Carpentaria, on the N.
coast of Australia, and Mr. Bentham, having seen 
no authentic specimens, was obliged to frame his character from Endlicher's 
description and the figure of F.
Bauer, to which, occurring in a very rare 
book, I have not here access.
As in the wild state the flowers are '} inch 
in diameter, it may be commended to the lovers of succulent plants as 
likely, under cultivation, to become almost as showy as P.
Thellusoni.
The small and isolated island on which this plant is found, washed by 
a frequently tempestuous sea, lying in the direct track of vessels home- 
ward bound from China, and the reefs surrounding which have proved 
the grave of many a noble vessel, whence they have derived their name 
(prata = silver in Portuguese), from the value of the wrecks and the 
amount of treasure sul)nu;rged, is from a phytogeographical point of view 
very interesting.
Its N.E. end is situated in lat.
20° 4-2' 3" N., long.
116° 43' 22" E.
; it is about a mile and a half long and half a mile wide, 
nowhere more than 30 or 35 feet above the sea-level, composed exclusively 
of disintegrated coral and sand, and surrounded on nearly two-thirds of 
its circumference by a steep coral barrier about forty miles round.
With 
the exception of iniuunerable gannets and a few Chinese wreckers and 
fishermen who constantly visit it, it is destitute of inhabitants.
It is dis- 
tant about a hundred and fifty British miles from the nearest point of the 
Chinese continent, about two hundred and eighty from the N.E. extre- 
mity of the island of Luzon, an<l three hundred and seventy-five from 
202 A SUPPLEMENT TO THE ' FLORA VECTENSIS.' 
Hainan.
, It is somewliat remarkable that, with such a geographical posi- 
tion, the flora of this reef-girt islet should show an unmistakable affinity 
with that of the great Australian continent, from which it is distant about 
one thousand nine hundred miles, the large islands of Borneo, Celebes, 
Papua, the Philippines and the Moluccas being interposed.
The follow- 
ing are — so far as my memory serves me — all the plants liitherto met 
with on Prata Island : —

; Porlnlaca austrulis, Eiidl.
; Triiim-

;

These species are found without a single exception in Queensland, and 
many of them also in North Australia ; and, though some are more or 
less difi"used as littoral plants through the Pacific isles, the Malayan Archi- 
pelago, and the South Asiatic coasts, they all seem primarily of Austra- 
lian origin.
The occuiTence of Calogyne chineusls, Benth., Thymnotm 
chinemis, Benth.
j-f and Phihjdrum lanwjhwHnm, Banks, in S.E. China, 
aflfords curious evidence of a connection bet',veen the Southern Asiatic and 
Korth-eastern Australian floras.

(See Liuuean Soc. Journal of Proc.
vi.
177, November, 1862.) 
Narcissus Pseudo-narcissus, L., var.
*Broi)ijieldii, Syme.
This is the 
var.
y of ' Flora Vectensis,' and from its place of growth is evidently not 
indigenous.
*.V. biftorus, Curt.
Weston and Easton, Freshwater (R.
Tucker).
An 
escape or remains of cultivation in all the localities.
*Tulipa st/lvestris, L.
My sister informs me that the station at Har- 
dingshoot is now (1871) nearly destroyed, through the recent building of 
a farmhouse on the exact spot ; but the plant was certainly the relic of a 
former garden.
*Oniithogalum umbellatum, L.
On the north slope of Bembridge 
Down, near the ruins of a cottage (Rev. C.
A. Bury).
Sparingly in a wood 
near Shaltieet, and in a meadow near Aftou House (Dr. Gr.
R. Tate).
The 
plant as found in the Isle of Wight agrees with 0.
angustifoUuM of 
Boreau.
Allium vineale, L.
On the edge of the cliff, and on slipped debris in 
Sandown Bay, the only species found here.
On the east bank of the 
Medina, above Black Mill (F.
Stratton).
Chalk pit west of Mountjoy 
(Miss Dennett).
Near Middletou House, and by the Yar above Yar- 
mouth (Dr. G.
R. Tate).
Near the Rectory House at Freshwater.
— Var, 
hulbiferuvi, Syme.
By East Medina millpond (J.
Pristo).
A. oleraceum, L.
Grassy banks on the edge of the cliff above Steep- 
hill and St. Lawrence (A.
J. Hambrough and A.
G. M., ISoS).
This is 
the only locality known in the Isle of Wight.
*Asparnf!us ojficinalis, L.
A few seedling ])lant3 on the sandhills be- 
low St. Helen's, close to the Ferry House, and evidently sprung from 
some stray seeds washed ashore.
This may explain the origin of the 
Asparagus at Norton Spit, wliere it grows at the extremity of a sandy point 
exposed to the tideway, and close to one of the oldest towns in the 
island.
It is quite difierent from the prostrate Cornish plant.
Juncus diffusus, Hoppe.
Very tine in Alum Bay (J.
G. Baker).
Luznla Borreri, Bromf.
In a copse above Brading, Qiiorr Copse, etc.
There is now no doubt that this is ujerely a form of L.
pilosa, wit!) luxu- 
riant foliage, and the fruit not fully developed.
In the immature seeds 
of L.
pilosi the crest is straight, as had been ascertained by Dr. Brorafield 
himself (Flor.
Vect., footnote to p.
518).
Butomus uvibellatns, L.
Formerly in a ditch near Pan Common 
(Major Smith).
Appears indigenous at Freshwater.
Arum italicum, Mill.
At Stcephill and other places in the Undercliff 
(A.
J. Hambrough, 1853).
The plant grows plentifully in the wild 
bushy slopes included within the grounds at Steephill ; also in similar 
bushy places at intervals all along the way to Niton, but does not extend 
beyond the limits of tlie Underclitf.
As A.
italicum grows wild at Caen, 
Cherbourg, etc., on the north coast of France, and was also found by Mr.
Hambrough in Sark and Guernsey, ami recently by Dr. Trimen and 
j\Ir. Stratton in Jersey, there is no reason to doubt its being native in 
the Isle of Wight ; nor can any one who has seen it in the Undercliff 
at the commcncc!n<nt of June, when it is in lull tlower, hesitate to pro- 
204; A SUPPLEMENT TO THE 'FLORA VECTENSIS.' 
nounce it indigenous.
The absence of white veins has been noticed by 
French as well as English writers.
Sparc/anium miHimum, Fries.
This is the only form of S.
nutans found 
in the Isle of Wight, where it is confined to the small pools near Cran- 
more Farm.
The long floating leaves which abound in the Medina and 
East Yar belong to S.
tsimplex, Huds., and I have once or twice found it 
flowering in the Yar.
Lemna gibba, L.
In several ditches on the north side of Brading 
Harbour, and near Brading Quay.
"^ Potamogeton planfagineiis, Ducr.
Peaty pools in the marsh at Easton, 
Freshwater (A.
J. Hambrongh, 1859).
"in the Wdderness at Rookley 
(F.
Townsend).
Requires confirmation.
P. pect'matus, L., var.
scoparius, Wallr.
Marsh ditches near the sea, 
at Brading and at Yarmouth.
I have not succeeded in finding P.
fla- 
bellafus, Bab., though in the appendix to Mr. Venables' ' Guide Book ' 
the name was misapplied to this variety scoparius.
Obs. p.
lucens, L., is not now to be found in Sandown Marshes, and 
it is believed that some other species was mistaken for it.
Ruppia rosfellata, Koch.
This is the only form of Rappia which I 
have identified, but the shape of its fruit varies considerably.
On the 
same plant the earlier fruits are scarcely at all oblique, while those pro- 
duced later on the upper branches of the same plant are much curved and 
deeply notched.
Zostera nana, Roth.
Wootton Bridge (Bronif.
in Phyt.).
Freshwater 
Creek (A.
G. M.).
Z. angiistifulia is common, but scarcely deserves to 
rank as a variety of Z.
marina.
EleocJuiris midticaiiUs, Sin. In some small pools on heathy ground at 
Lynn gravel pits.
With S.
pauclflorus on St. Helen's Green.
Scirpus pancijiorus, Lightf.
On the east bank of the Yar, between 
Freshwater and Yarmouth (J.
G. Baker).
S. jluilans, L.
Staplers (F.
Stratton).
At the W^ilderness (F.
Towns- 
end, who informs me that this is the plant recorded doubtfully in ' Flora 
Vectensis ' as Carex dioica).
Obs. Eriophorum vaginalum, L., must be excluded, (Sec ' Phytolo- 
gist,' iii.
p. 1032.) 
Carex paniculata, L.
The foi'm with narrow unbranched panicle occurs 
on Lake Common, and in the Parsonage Lynch, Newchurch.
C. teretiuscida, Good.
Sparingly in the wettest part of Easton Marsh, 
Freshwater (1862).
In the Wilderness at Rookley !
(F.
Stratton, 1870).
C. axillaris, Good.
In the hollow at north-east corner of Quarr Copse.
Both this locality and the description given of C.
Bonni iigha nseniana by 
Dr. Bromfield belong really to C.
axillaris.
Good., which occurs also in 
the ditch under the boundary fence near Binstead.
In a hedge-bank by 
Middleton Lane, Freshwater (A.
G. M.)., and in Saltern's Copse, near 
Norton, Freshwater (Herb.
Bromf.) 
C. Bbnningliauseniana, Weihe.
Parsonage Lynch, Newchurch, in 
tolerable plenty (1858).
This is the only locality known in the Isle of 
Wight, and C.
axillaris does not grow here.
I have not succeeded in 
finding any ripe fruit upon C.
BdniiingJiauseniana ; and as both at New- 
churcli and near Tunbridge Wells I have found it growing in company 
with C.
remota and C.
panicnlaiu, I think the suggestion that it is a 
hybrid is probably correct.

G. vvlgaris, Fries.
At Alverstnne Lynch, in Sandown Marshes, 
and at Easton, Freshwater, T have found a tall form which 1 believe is 
the plant mentioned by Dr. Bromfield as " C.
stricta,'" which latter has 
not come under my notice.
The " variety ^.
of C.

more closely examined I prefer to exclude it as introduced by some 
accident.]

Mr. W.
P. Hiern has very kindly examined and named, according to 
his views lately published in the 'Journal of Botany ' (pp.
65, etc.), my 
series of Batrachian Ranunculi, collected in the Isle of Wight ; and, 
as he has given so much tinie and study to the subject, I gladly avail 
myself of his nomenclature, which will be useful for comparison with what 
has been said before on p.
74.
Tlie numbers prefixed to the names are 
those used by Mr. Hiern, and my comments are enclosed in brackets.
1 .
Ranunculus homceophyllus.
Pond at Bembridge.
(This is floating 
" hederaceus."') 25.
R. trichopliyllus.
Cothey Bottom Copse and 
Spencer Koad, Ryde.
"A large form" of the same from Brading 
Marshes Mr. Hiern thinks may belong to R.Jhribiindus.
29.
R. Drouetii.
Knighton Upper Mill-pond and ]^iading Marshes.
19.
R. Godrovii.
Brading Marshes.
(This is my " i?.
Drouetii, with floating leaves," and 
I still think it belongs to R.
Dronelii rather than to R.
trichopliyllus.
It 
has no relation to the large form of tricJiophyllus above mentioned, but 
passes into the typical Z)yo?/e/«.) 13.
R. elouf/alus.
Sandown Marslics.
14.
R. truncatus.
Sandown Marshes.
(These two are the later stage of 
my "  peltatus.") 15.
R.floribundus.
Bembridge; Yaverland ; Pan 
Common and Sandown Marshes.
(This I believe to be the early stage of 
the plant we call ' '' peltatus" and "truncatus.'") 18.
R. radians?
Dennetts Marsh, Bembridge.
(This is what I call " Juderopliyllus," and 
Mr. Hiern remarks that it passes into R.
Jioribundns, which I have myself 
collected in a different season, from the same small pond ; each being the 
only form in one year.) 11.
R. Baudotii.
Brading Marshes; pond 
towards Yaverland ; and Nettlestone.
R. Baudotii, var.
cfpspitosus.
Brading Marshes.
34.
R. marinus.
Brading Marshes.
(This is simply 
R. Baudotii, without floating leaves.) With the addition of R.
Lenor- 
mandi, R.
liederafolius, and R.
submersus {Jloribundus, without floating 
leaves), we have, in the Isle of V\'ight, thirteen out of the twenty-two 
British forms described by Mr. Hiern.
Omitted.
Valeriana dioica, L.
In Priory Marsh Meadows and in Clatterford 
Marsh, near Carisbrooke (F.

SHOUT NOTES AND QUERIES.

After making these additions and deductions, the whole Floni amounts 
to 753 out of the 1263 species given in Hooker's ' Students' Flora,' or to 
about 100 more according to Babington's ' Manual'; and if the 50 well- 
established naturalized species be added, the total will amount to about 
800 or 900 species, according to the author followed, this being nearly 
three-fifths of the British flora.
Only five plants are in the British Isles peculiar to the Isle of Wight, 
viz.
: — 
Calamintha sylvatica.
fMatthiola incana.
'^ 
Festuca ambigua.
Arum italicum.
Chara alopecuroides.
The Isle of Wight shares Gladiolus iUyrlcns with Hampshire, and Pitl- 
monaria angnstifolia with Hants and Dorset, while such plants as Cyperus 
longus, Melampyrum arvense, and Orobanche ccendea, are among the rarest 
of English plants.
No enumefrttion >f a flora can be complete without considering the 
proportion of naturalized plants, and the conditions under which they oc- 
cur ; and I hope to return to this subject on a future occasion.

SHORT NOTES AND QUEEIES.
Stler trilobum, Scop., IN England.
— In the beginning of June, 
1867, I found, upon rough chalky rising ground near Cherry Hinton, 
Cambridgeshire, growing amongst Rubiis, Viburnum Lantana, and other 
plants characteristic of a calcareous soil, an Umbelliferous plant which I 
could not determine, but imagined to be a variety of Smyrnium Olusatrum.
Ou the 25th of May, 1871, I again visited the spot (being the first op- 
portunity I had had' since 186?), and found the plant still growing there.
i took specimens to the British Museum, where it was determined to be 
Siler trilobum, Scop.
{ = S.
(ajuiU'yio'fulium, Giertn.).
The locality is a 
limited one, and more so now than formerly, owing to the increase of 
cultivation (Clover principally) on the bushy, chalky ground below.
It 
is singular that, in the immediate neighbourhood, grow two very rare 
British Umbelliferce, — AUmmanta Libanotis and Buuium Bulhocadanum ; 
but, whereas the latter of these grows exclusively, so far as I could see, 
in the semi-cultivated ground near, amidst Sainfoin and Clover, the Siler 
affects the uncultivated chalk.
It seems strange that such a large plant 
should have, until now, escaped detection ; but I have Professor Babing- 
ton's authority for stating that it has always been hitherto considered to 
be Smyrnium Olusntrum, — to which, when young, the leaves bear a strong 
resemblance, — and is entered as that species in the ' Flora of Cambridge- 
shire,' p.
lOl'.
Jacquiu's description of its habitat in Austria, " in asperis 
et calcareis montibus," agrees admirably with the Cherry Hinton locality.

We hope to give a

doing so ; indeed, in the absonee of ripe fruit, it is not possible to speak 
with absolute certainty as to its name.

PoLYGALA AUSTRIACA, Craiitz., IN Kent.
— I liave much pleasure in 
sending specimens of this, which I had the good fortune of discovering 
on June 5th on Wye Down.
Dr. Boswell Syme, to whom I submitted a 
specimen, pronounced it to be undoubtedly P.
anstriaca.
On June 17th 
I again, in company with another botanist, found it plentifully growing in 
tv\'o narrow strips of rough, chalky ground on the border of copsewood.
There must surely be more of it on other parts of the downs, which are 
very extensive.
— J.
P. Duthie.
[We hope our readers will examine any chalk districts in their neigh- 
bourhoods for this interesting Polygala, hitherto only known in England 
in two spots in North Yorkshire.
It is readily distinguished from P.
cal- 
cnrea, Schultz, by its much smaller tlowers and narrow wings.
The 
central nerve also of the wings is either not at all or but very slightly 
branched, and the branches very rarely, though occasionally to a slight 
extent, inosculate with those of the lateral veins.
Some of Mr. Duthie's 
specimens are between four and five inches high.
They seem referable 
to the restricted P.
anstriaca of Reichenbach; the Teesdale plant being 
his P.
uUginosa.

Htmenophyllum unilaterale.
— Apropos of the extract relative to 
this plant printed at page 188, I wish to remark that through the kind- 
ness of Lady Barkly I had the opportunity of examining specimens of the 
plant referred to by Mr. Andrews, wliicli was given to Dr. Meller from 
the Bourbon Museum as authentic H.
unilaterale, " named by Bory de 
St. Vincent himself," and that they clearly do not belong to nnilaterale 
at all, but to //.
gracile, of Bory, which occurs both in Bourbon and the 
Mauritius, a plant which, though rather like tn7ibridge)ise in general habit, 
differs from it by the segments being destitute of serration (as Mr. An- 
drews has noted), and in the position of the sori and shape of the invo- 
lucre.
The original description of unilaterale by Willdenow (Sp. Plant.
v. 522) from Bory's specimens is a tolerably full one; and if Mr. An- 
drews will compare his plant with this he will, I doubt not, see clearly 
that two very different species have been confounded together, j)robably 
by some accidental transposition of labels.
We have no specimen at 
Kew of any Hymenoplujllnm with serrated segments from Bourbon at all, 
and only one from the Mauritius, gathered by Captain Caruiichael long 
ago, and that has a distinctly toothed involucre, and in this way differs 
from unilaterale as Willdenow describes it just as tuubrldgense differs 
from Wilsoni.
So far as the description of unilaterale goes, it fits our 
English Wilsoni very well.
H. Boryanum is very different from either 
gracile or nnilaterale, much stronger, and more compound than either 
when properly developed, with hairy surfaces, and copious compound, 
round, terminal sori.

possibly not be an indigenous one, but what reason have we to suppose 
that it was " probably also sowed " in its Godalming habitat, Shalford 
Common ?
I have gathered it there myself, and there is nothing to 
indicate its not being native.
In Brewer's ' Flora of Surrey,' it is also 
stated to have been gathered there earlier by Mr. J.
D. Salmon ; and 
neither IMr. Brewer nor Dr. Hooker, in his ' Students' Flora,' throw any 
doul)t on its nativity.
Nor does its geographical distribution render it in 
any way improbable that it should be a British plant.
— Alfred W.
Bennett.
[Dr. Gray informs us that he founds his opinion on the fact that the 
old Botanical Society, which made frequent excursions to Shalford, never 
detected Cyperus fuscm there, and states that the tradition that it was 
sown, though it would be hard to legally prove it, is sufficiently credit- 
worthy to throw doubt on a plant found in a single locality, and that only 
within very recent times.
— Eds.] 
I can aver that my departed friend, Salmon, did not introduce Cyperus 
fuse/is at Shalford ; indeed, he took some considerable pains to ascertain 
its history.
It was not introduced by the gentleman whom he suspected 
to have been the means of its introduction.
I believe it to be as truly 
native there as at Chelsea.
Few people are aware of the difficulty of 
naturalizing plants : I suspect that nature has more to do with the distri- 
bution of foreign species than human agency ; but whether this be so or 
not, I can affirm that neither the late Mr. Salmon nor the gentleman he 
suspected had anything to do with the introduction of Cyperus fuscus at 
Shalford.

Barbarea stricta.
— This year, I have found Barbareastricta scattered 
for at least a mile along the Surrey bank of the Thames between Rich- 
mond and Kew, and have seen it also on the Middlesex side at Isleworth.
It grows in a precisely similar manner to that in which it is found about 
the Ouse at York, where I used to see it regularly during several succes- 
sive years, scattered at intervals amongst the I'ank herbage along the 
river bank, interspei'sed with at least an equal quantity of B.
vnlgaris.
The petals are two lines long, half as long again as the sepals, by half a 
line broad at the tip, and, by their smaller size, more erect habit, and 
deeper colour (orange as compared with lemon) give it a different aspect 
from vulgaris, which readily catches the eye of any one who is looking for 
it.
I have dried a supply of specimens for the Exchange Club.

during the winter, but which was still in a very rough state.

MoRCHELLA CKASSiPES, Pers.
— This Morel, Avhich was first recorded 
and described as British in the sixth volume of this Journal, page 1, has 
been found in two localities in the Isle of Wight, viz.
Westover Park and 
]\Iarvel Copse.
It was first noticed by the children of the Rev. R.
Nutt, 
M.A., Curate of Carisbrooke, who afterwards accompanied me to the loca- 
lity at Westover.
There, and also at Marvel Copse, numbers of these 
immense Fungi were still standing, though at that date, the 15th May, 
we were not able to find any specimens which were not much past their 
prime.
At Westover, the Fungus grows in the half-wild shrubberies in 
the Park, chiefly in the shade ; and at Marvel Copse on hedgebanks, in a 
much more exposed situation.
lu both places simply on the soil, and 
not apparently on dead or decaying wood or vegetable matter.
The 
average height of the specimens was about ten inches, but probably they 
were taller when in perfection.
— Fred.

A single specimen of large size was found in Mr. Alfred Smee's garden 
at Hackbridge, Surrey, growing in company with M.
escidenta and M.
semilibern.
Several specimens of great size were found in May, 1871, 
by the late Mrs. Gulson, of Eastcliff, Teignmouth, at the tunnel cover 
close to Hawkesyard Park, Rugeley, Statt'ordshire.
One plant was 11 
inches high, with a diameter of 7^ inches, and a stem 15 inches in circum- 
ference.
I have also found it near Ware.

Trichomanes radicans (p.

— In continuation of my note on 
this as British, I record that a fresh frond was sent to me a few days 
since, stated to be from a plant which was collected in Yorkshire in a 
perfectly wild state and locality, and which is now growing in a garden 
at Wallington.
The exact locality is withheld, but I am told it is not 
the old one where Richardson and Hudson collected their specimens.
I am unable to vouch for anything more of this account than that the 
frond sent to me is undoubtedly that of Trichomanes radicans.

Pyrus communis, Linn., var.
Briggsii (Syme, Rep. Lond.
Bot. Ex.
Club), 1870.
— For some years past I have known and observed the form 
of Pyrus communis growing near Plymouth which Dr. Boswell Syme has 
thus provisionally named; and am able to add a few particulars respecting 
it to those given by him in the Bot. Ex.
Club Report for 1870, reprinted, 
after revision by its a<ithor, in Journ.
Bot. Vol.
IX.
pp.
180-187.
I 
have found this form only in the one " hedge between Thornbury and 
Common Wood," but there it occurs in three or four spots, and there are 
altogether about a dozen bushes of it, 10-12 ft.
high.
They are rather 
more shrubby and crab-like in appearance than are most of the examples 
of the so-called " Wdd Pear" that I have seen about Plymouth.
Dr.
Boswell Syme errs in supposing this variety not to be spinous, for at least

the lower branches are plentifully furnished with spines.
What is very 
remarkable is the late period — the beg-inninf^ of May — at which it flowers, 
corresponding as to this, not with our Pears generally, which are in blossom 
quite a fortnight or three weeks before, but with the Apple and Crab, or 
being a few days later than the last in unfolding its petals, which are 
often prettily tinged with pink on the outside.
This spring it has bloomed 
very freely, and 1 have secured a supply of specimens for the next distri- 
bution by the Club.
The elongation of the rachis of the cyme, mentioned 
by Dr. Boswell Syme, seems a constant character, as well as the densely 
woolly calyx.
Although this occurs in a hedgerow away from houses, yet 
I do not regard it, or any other form of Pyrus communis growing about 
Plymouth, as indigenous, for I have never met with the Wild Pear in a 
wood or copse ; and even when it occurs in hedgerows, it is often as a 
single bush.
It is, moreover, uncommon ; for a dozen years' botanizing 
in the neighbourhood of Plymouth has revealed it to me at only about as 
many stations.

Stratiotes ALOiDES IN CENTRAL CHESHIRE.
— A curious instance of 
the appearance, diffusion, and sul)sequent extinction of Stratiotes occurred 
on Taljley Lake, near Knutsford, the history of which may be worth put- 
ting on record, as bearing upon the question of the nativity of this local 
species in Britain.
A shallow arm of Tabley Lake was, some twenty-five 
years ago, completely choked up in places with the Water-soldier.
The 
passage of the pleasure boats was much impeded, and fishing rendered 
difl^cidt.
This lake is an artificial piece of water, covering many acres, 
made early in the present century.
It was originally stocked with fish 
from many of the surrounding pits and meres, — a natural enough way for 
Stratiotes to have arrived also, since the plant is widely, though thinly, dis- 
tributed through all the adjacent district.
At Booths, Alderley, and 
Winchara I have personally observed it, while local Floras increase tliis list 
of contiguous stations.
Any one, therefore, who wishes to investigate 
the claims of Stratiotes to be a native of this country, will do well to visit 
the plain of Central Cheshire.
AVith regard to the Tabley Stratiotes, the 
plant was forty years ago so obnoxious that the trustee of the property, an 
ardent angler, caused an iron grating about 30 feet wide to be erected at a 
point where the lake runs through into a piece of water of lower level, — 
these expensive precautions being taken solely to prevent plants of Stratiotes 
being washed tiirough and populating the lower water to the same extent 
which they had already done the upper ; a submerged " Water-pine " 
being an enemy most formidable to fishing lines.
But I suspect that, as 
far as my memory reaches, — that is, some twenty-five years back, — Stra- 
tiotes, though still very abiuulant, had begun to wane in Tabley Lake.
Fifteen years ago it had become scarce, and about ten years l)ack the very 
last plant disappeared.
I have reintroduced it into two of the park ponds.
In each case some sixty or fughty plants have been the result in two years 
from some half-dozen imported specimens.
This summer 1 have had no op- 
portunity of visiting these ponds, which lie on each side of the " Serpen- 
tine " bridge ; but any of your Manchester readers who are passing in that 
direction will probably find them full enough just now of Stratiotes in 
flower.
I think tlic local name " Water-pine " fidly as felicitous as the 
more classicd " Water-soldier." — J.
L. Warken.

Veronica triphyllos.
— I have great pleasure in sending you a spe- 
cimen of Veronica triphyllos.

from Langley, Buckinghamshire.
In the same field grew Camelina of 
two kinds, and two or three other plants I had never seen before.

[Mrs. White's specimens of V.
triphyllos are very luxuriant, 
6 or 8 inches high.
There can be little doubt that the plant was, as well 
as the Ccuiielina and other strange weeds, sown with the Clover.
The 
locality has been accidentally but erroneously recorded as " near Ealing, 
Middlesex," in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle' (1871), p.

has not yet been noticed in that county.

Right-handed v.
Left-handed.
— In the March number of this Jour- 
nal (p.
78) I brought before the notice of readers the great want of uni- 
formity in accent in botanical names which obtains, even among the masters 
of the science.
I now lay before thera a confusion in the use of the above 
terms recently brought under my notice.
At the May meeting of the 
London Mathematical Society, Professor Clerk Maxwell requested infor- 
mation from the members as to the convention established among mathe- 
maticians with respect to the relation between the positive direction of 
motion along any axis, and tlie positive direction of rotation round it.
Stating the conventions in use amongst the rival sets of writers, he illus- 
trated his remarks thus : in the writings of the one set the positive direc- 
tions of translation and rotation are connected as in a left-handed screw 
or the tendril of the Hop ; in those of the other set, they are symbolized 
by an ordinary or right-handed screw or the tendril of the Vine ; and he 
refers to Linnfeus (' Philosophia Botanica,' 1757, p.
39), where, speaking 
of the trunk, he says, " Caulis .
. .
spiraliter ascendens.
. .
. Sinistrorsum 
([ secundum solem vulgo : Humulus, Lonicera, Tamus.
Dextrorsum 
]) contra motum solis vulgo : Convolvulus, Phaseolus," etc.
Mr. Max- 
well states also that De Candolle was the first botanist who, in 1827, has 
decided otherwise, and that many botanists have been led astray and per- 
verted by him.
(I am not acquainted with the references upon which this 
statement is founded.) Now it may not be of much importance to bota- 
nists how this question is settled, but it is, as Mr. Maxwell showed, of some 
considerable importance to mathematicians.
" In pure mathematics little in- 
convenience is felt from the want of uniformity, but in astronomy, electro- 
magnetics, and all physical sciences, it is of the greatest importance that 
one or other system should be specified and persevered in.
The relation 
between the one system and the other is the same as that between an object 
and its reflected imrige,and the operation of passing from the one to the otiier 
has been called by Listing /^frrcrs/o//." The upshot of the discussion was 
that, in consequence of the arguments of Sir W.
Thomson aiul Dr.
Hirst in favour of the right-handed system derived from the motion of the 
earth and planets, and the convention that the north is to be reckoned 
positive, the right-handed system,— symbolized, as Professor Maxwell 
expresses himself, " by a corkscrew or the tendril of the Vine," — was 
adopted by the Society.

217 
CHINCHONA PLANTATION IN JAMAICA.
According to the reports of 1870, published in the Jamaica papers, the 
progress of the 40 acres of chinchonas, planted at the end of the year 
1868 continues satisfactory.
The tallest plant of Chinchona offlrinaHs is 
11 feet, of C.
S2iccirubra 9 feet, and of the other species 8 to 9 feet.
Tlie 
circumference of the stems near the ground of all the species, except 
C. offichialls, which is of more slender habit, is from 10 to 12 inches 
(double of what they were twelve months ago).
The writer of the reports 
continues : — I speak of tlie finest specimens in the plantations, but all the 
others have made proportionate progress.
The diameter of ihe branches 
from side to side in some of the best plants is over 6 feet.
These plants 
had withstood the severe drought, which lasted nearly five months, in the 
most satisfactory manner.
The opposite extreme of wet weather has pre- 
vailed in the past year.
From the beginning of August till the end of tlie 
year it rained, on an average, four days a week.
I was not in a position 
to keep a record of the rainfall, together with other meteorological observa- 
tions of the past seasons.
By way, however, of intlicating the excessive rain- 
fall experienced in these months, I would remark that the extraordinary fall 
of 24 inches occurred in thirty hours on the 17th and 18(h of November.
From this and other isolated measurements I have reason to believe 
that during the five months above referred to, the rain-f\xll must have con- 
siderably exceeded 150 inciies.
Frequently recurring with the rain-fall 
violent winds prevailed, which, in these altitudes, almost approach to a 
hurricane, but from which the plants have sustained little injurv.
The 
incessant rains, however, have caused several landslips, sometimes forming 
gullies to a depth of about 12 feet, cutting across roads, thereby necessi- 
tating the alteration of their course to the extent of nearly a mile.
The 
total damage done to the plantations in this way, and the consequent 
rolling of huge stones and roots down the steep mountain slopes, has 
resulted in the loss of about 500 to 600 trees.
When, however, it is 
borne in mind that this has been an exceptionally rainy year, and tiiat tiie 
land is steep in some place, and newly under cultivation from a state of 
nature, — the surface denuiled, the forest roots decaying, and the soil 
loosened, the powerful action of tropical rains may be easily conceived, 
and the extent of injury must be considered as, under these circumstances, 
trivial.
The plants have thus passed satisfactorily the ordeal of two 
years, exhibiting the most nuirked extremes of seasons to which tropical 
countries are liable.
The 40 acres of forest land, alluded to in my report for 1869 as 
having then been prepared for the extension of the plantations, were 
planted out, except 10 acres in December, 1869, in the months of 
February, March and April.
The plants were placed 6 and 7 feet apart, 
which gives approximately 1000 plants per acre — 40,000 plants.
'The 
average height of these plants is now 2 or 3 feet, in a healthy and pro- 
mising condition.
The principle of planting 6 and 7 feet apart — the 
previous year's planting being 10 feet apart — lias occurred to me from a 
similar system of close planting recently adopted in the chinehona planta- 
tions of India, there, imleed, planted 4 and 5 feet apart.
The prospcc- 
218 CINCHONA CULTIVATION IN JAMAICA.
tive result of this close plantino; is the securing of rapid returns ; a few 
years sufficing to cover the intervening spaces.
Each alternate tree is 
then cut down and the bark sent to market.
The operation of cutting 
down makes room for the spread of the surviving trees, which in a few 
more years again approach and impede each other, and in like manner 
have to be thinned as before.
This extremely thick planting of trees is 
objectionable, inasmuch as the trees possess a spreading habit.
For ex- 
ample, those planted at 5 feet or at ?
feet apart occupy the interspaces 
in three or four years.
At this state of growth the plant would hardly, I 
conceive, be worth stripping, as tlie yield per plant, probably, could not 
exceed one pound of dried bark (value, say 2s.).
Whereas trees six or 
seven years old, under favourable circumstances, must each yield five 
or six pounds of dry bark.
On the other hand, however, this system 
of thick planting has its advantages.
The close planting costs but 
little additional, and the plants are readily propagated.
When found 
too close, they are easily cut down to allow for the expansion of the 
remaining trees.
When thus planted close they keep down the weeds, 
and hence their culture expenses are lessened.
The entire area of ground planted with chinchonas is nearly ninety 
acres.
The severe rainy weather of the ])ast year prevented the enlarge- 
ment of this area by at least 20 acres, for which plants were in readiness.
Including these 20 acres, about 80 acres of the forest Avere felled and 
partly cleared for the extension of the plantations.
This land will be 
completely ]n'epared for the reception of the plants in a few months.
In May I hope to have 40 acres planted — about 1000 plants per acre, 
with C.
succiriibra ; and near the end of the year the other 40 acres, 
together with 50 additional acres proposed to be cleared, planted with 
C. Calisaya, the two most precious species.
The number of plants per- 
manently planted out is 60,000 ; the numi)er of seedlings in pots 40,000, 
and of seedlings in nursery beds 10,000 — total, 110,000.
I had intended 
that the plants required for the extension of the plantations, to the extent 
of 130 acres, above alluded to as under preparation for being planted out 
in the year 1871, would be propagated chiefly from cuttings.
But most 
fortunately two fine trees, at Cold Spring, of C.
snccirubrn, one of which 
is a magnificent tree nine years old and 30 feet high, yielded seeds for 
the first time in Jamaica, from which, through the generosity of Mr. John 
M'Lean, I procured, in the beginning of September, nearly 50,000 ex- 
cellent seeds; the result being now 40,000 healthy seedlings.
Better 
plants are produced by seeds than from cuttings.
Several young trees in 
the Government ])lantations have a good crop of seeds ripening, and 
others are coming into flower.
The number of seeds likely to be obtained 
from these young trees in a few months can hardly be under 100,000.
Thus the 50,000 seedlings in course of treatment, and those now ripening 
on the trees, will suffice to plant all the land proposed to be prepared to 
the end of 1871, making a total of 320 acres containing about 200,000 
plants.
I expect shortly to submit samples of chinchona bark, of the different 
kinds, to the island chemist for analysis, in order to ascertain the per- 
centage of alkaloid, more accurately performed when the bark is in a fresh 
state.
It has been discovered that the sun's rays, falling on the bark 
while in a green state, is prejudicial to alkaloids.

ORCHILLA.
Orcliilla of a fine quality has been discovered in Lower California.
An expedition is fitting out at New York to gather orchilla in its newly 
found south-western home.
What is orchilla, that California i)apers 
should crow over its existence in that lonsr peninsuha, and why should it 
be thought a good specuhxtion to ship 3U0 men, women, and cldhlren 
from New York, passage free, to go out there and gather it ?
We will 
answer these questions.
Orchilla weed, orchella, orchal, oi* archil — for by 
tiiese divers names it is known — is a lichen, wliicli yields a beautiful 
violet-reddish dye.
It is used to some extent for colouring silks and 
woollens, and has only the fault, but a serious one, that it lacks perma- 
nence.
Notwithstanding that defect, it is still an article in re(|uest 
among dyers, and its production hitherto being limited, commands good 
prices.
Its principal sources of supply for Euro|)e are the Canary and 
Cape de Verde Islands, Barbary, and the Levant ; to these have been 
recently added Ecuador, Peru, and the Gallapagos Islands.
Those who 
glance over the tables of imports must have observed it now and then 
appearing among the items along with annatto, argols, divl-divi, garan- 
cine, meliothe, safflower, and other herbs, roots, woods or gums of out- 
landish names.
Last year this country imported .^14,900 worth of orchilla 
weed, and ^4700 worth of orchilla liquor or tincture.
Its value in 
England, which is its principal market, varies greatly from time to time.
In seasons of scarcity it has been as liigh as £1000 per ton ; but is now 
quoted at 26«.
to 66*.
per cwt., according to quality.
It grows on bushes 
and stones near the sea ; and in some regions so abundantly that a 
quarter of a ton may be picked by one person in a day, a profitable busi- 
ness if it could l)e kept up at present prices.
Of the profusion and the 
quality of orchilla in Lower California we avouch nothinii; from our own 
knowledge ; but it is probably not inferior to the Old World article, since 
that from Ecuador, on the Pacific coast, is said to be fully equal, if not 
superior, to its European and African competitors.
Still less would we 
like to commit ourselves to an endorsement of the novel enterprise of 
shipping colonies from New York to hunt for this valuable lichen in 
Lower California.
Tliey go out, we understand, at the expense of a 
Guayaquil house, which makes a speciality of the orchilla trade, tliougjj 
they are under the patronage of the Lower California Company, which 
has an interest in populating the peninsula.
Not having been fortunate 
as yet in inducing emigration to that region, the Company may think 
themselves lucky if orchilla, at fabulous prices per ton, should attract 
settlers there.
On this point we liave nothing but to quote the assurances 
of California papers that it abounds along the coast, that it is not unifonn 
in quality, and that experience and skill are necessary in gathering it to 
obtain the better and only saleable kinds.
Incidei'itally, we may mention 
that the increased consumption of orchilla in Lurope as a substitute for 
cochineal is said to have ali'ectcd the value of the latter production.
A subsidiary use of orchilla is, in its alcoholic infusion, as the red liquid 
in spirit thermometers.

ON HIPPOCRATEACEyE.
"We are glad to be enabled to give the following abstract of Mr. Miers' 
important paper, read before the Linnean Society on June 1st, based on 
a long and hiborious examination chiefly of the South American species of the 
Order.
Tlie history of the family shows the widely-divergent opinions of 
numerous botanists in regard to its atiinities, — the absolute want of know- 
ledge to guide these opinions at last culmiuiiting in the extinction of tlie 
Hippocrateacea by the authors of the new ' Genera Plantarum,' who have 
reduced it to a mere tribe of the Cdadracece ; and not only so, but have 
amalgamated the several genera previously established into two, viz.
Hip- 
pocratea and Salacia.
The large amount of evidence here presented will, 
however, show its right to stand as a distinct Natural Order, having, in 
fact, little connection with CdastracetE in any well-digested system of 
arrangement.
The chief characters in its floral structure consist in having 5 sepals, 
5 alternate petals imbricated in sestivation, and only 3 stamens (very 
rarely 5) ; the most important feature is the hypogynous disk, variable in 
shape, but constantly placed between the stamens and petals ; the ovary is 
always superior, usually 3-locular, with definite anatropous ovules fixed in 
the axis.
The mode of growth of the ovary varies greatly, and on these 
diflerences of development the author divided the family into three separate 
tribes : — i.
Hippocratefe, where, in the progress of growth, the axis of the 
ovary never lengthens, remaining completely atrophied, the cells growing 
upwards vastly, sometimes to a hundred times the length of the axis at the 
maturity of the flower, thus producing 3 distinct capsules from a single 
ovary, which sometimes open 2-valvately and have winged seeds, or are 
indehiscent, with unciform seeds borne upon a carinated or alar support : 
upon such dift'erences five several genera are established.
2. Toiitelefe, 
distinguished by a drupaceous fruit, often of large size, the growth of an 
ovary wherein the axis lengthens commensurately with the cells, the fruit 
being thus 3-locular, with several seeds, which in most cases are covered 
by an ariUine, a fleshy complete coating, resolving itself into a mucilagi- 
nous pulp that envelopes the seeds: this tribe consists of eight genera.
3. Kippistice, remarkable for a floral development hitherto unknown 
among Dicotyledoues, but long ago described by Mr. Eobert Brown in 
Monocotyledones ; here the stigmata, instead of alternating as usual with 
the stamens, and standing opposite to the cells of the ovary, are opposite 
to the stamens, and alternate with the cells of the ovary ; the fruit is dru- 
paceous, variable in the position of the seeds, but with characters resem- 
bling those of Tontdiece : this tribe consists of three genera.
There are 
thus seventeen genera in all, with well-marked characters, which were sepa- 
rately illustrated by as many drawings, each amply explained by analytical 
figures.
The numerous facts here shown in regard to structure are, for 
the most part, hitherto undescribed, many being derived from analyses 
made of plants in the living state.
In summarizing these details, the 
author pointed out the many salient points of distinction in the structure 
of Hippocratencece and Celastracece.
1. In the former, the stamens are generally anisomerous in regard to 
the petals (3 to 5) ; in the latter, they are constantly isomerous, with sta- 
mens equal to, or double the number of the petals.
ON HIPPOCRATEACE.E. 221 
2. In the former, the stamens are distinctly inserted inside the disk ; 
in the latter, they are invariably inserted outside the disk.
3. In the former, the anthers, generally of a peculiar form, are con- 
stantly extrorse ; in the latter, they are of the usually normal structure, 
and always introrse.
4. In the former, the disk is generally elevated, and presents a free 
wall of separation between the stamens and" more external parts ; in the 
latter, it is a mere expansion of the torus, intervening between the ovary, 
and all other floral parts.
5. In the former, the sepals, petals, stamens, and disk are persistent 
at the base of the fruit, and are never seen in such position in the latter 
family.
6. In the former, the superior ovary is always elevated above the torus, 
and quite free from it ; in the latter, it is always more or less partially 
imbedded in the disk, and half agglutinated with it.
7. The atrophied condition of the axis of the ovary, though not a con- 
stant feature, is one quite peculiar to the Hippocrateacere ; and on the other 
hand, in Celastracers we tind no growth at all approaching the several 
kinds of large drupaceous fruits seen in the Hippocrateacea:.
8. In the development of the seeds there is a constant distinction.
In 
Hippocrateacece they are invariably without albumen ; in the CelaatracecB, 
the embryo, without exception, is enveloped in albumen, usually copious.
In the former, the cotyledons are often closely conferruminated in a solid 
mass, a circumstance quite unknown in the latter.
9. In the Hippocrateacece no trace of an arillus can be seen; in Celas- 
traceee, though not universal, a distinct arillus in most cases partially sur- 
rounds one extremity of the seeds.
In the former, in one tribe, the seeds 
exhibit a greater or smaller expansion of the testa, in the shape of a large 
membranaceous wing, or a narrower alar keel, while in the two others they 
are invested by an ariUine, an entire fleshy coating, the nature of which 
Mr. Miers explained many years ago, — a feature seen in some other fami- 
lies, though too often unnoticed by botanists.
10.
In the Hippocrateacece, the leaves, but more particularly the 
branches of the inflorescence, the pedicels, sepals, petals, contain nume- 
rous white elastic threads, which hold the parts together when broken ; 
and these spiral threads often extend to the pericarps, to the integuments 
of the seeds, and even occasionally to the fleshy cotyledons.
Nothing of 
this kind has yet been observed in Celastracece.
Any one of these peculiarities, by itself, would tend little to support 
any separation of these two families, but the sum of the whole tells power- 
fully to mark a great distinction in their organization.
The only argu- 
ments that have yet been urged for their near affinity are that both 
generally consist of arborescent plants, with evergreen leaves, an axillary 
inflorescence, petals and sepals with imbricated {estivation, a 3-celled 
ovary, a simple style and stigma ; but these are all characters common to 
many other families, distantly related, and wholly insufficient by them- 
selves to establish any near affinity.
The more probable inference is t^liat 
these two families should be separated by a long interval.

Smith, F.L.S., assisted by A.

Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S.
This is a work which will be cordially welcomed by all British mycolo- 
gists.
The authors propose to publish a series of coloured figures of 
British Hymenomycetous Fungi, to be confined principally to such as are 
new or rare, but to include occasionally other species which, although avcU 
known, may not have been hitherto satisfactorily figured.
This first part 
consists of 24 phites, containing figures of 30 species, of which 18 belong to 
the genus Jgaricus, 6 to Cortinnrins, 1 to Laciari/is, 1 to Copriniis, 1 to Gom- 
phidiits, 1 to Cantharelliis, and 2 to Boletus.
To those who are acquainted 
with the artistic powers of Mr. Wilson Saunders and Mr. W.
G. Smith, it is 
hardly necessary to say that the figures are excellent.
Of the 30 species 
drawn, 14 have not been figui-ed before, and some others only in works by 
no means easily accessible.
There is little to be said by wny of criticism.
A few remarks only have suggested themselves in looking through the 
text and plates.
Cantharellus radicosus {^\.
1) shows, in a mai'ked manner, 
how deceptive a character size may be without the examination of a large 
series of specimens.
This plant was described in the 'Annals of Natural 
History ' (1866) as having a pileus three-fourths to one inch across.
The 
pileus of the largest plant shown on this plate is nearly three inches in 
diameter, and the authors state that some specimens found in Epping 
Forest were much larger than any they have figured.
The pure glutinous 
white of Agaricits nmcidus can hardly be shown in a drawing.
Specimens 
occasionally occur having the dark tint shown in ])late 5, fig.
2 ; but the 
foxy tinge of the pileus, stem, and ring in fig.
1 leads to the supposition 
that the drawing was made from specimens past their prime.
The same 
remark applies to J.
lignatilis (pi.
6, fig.
4), the cold dead white of which 
is as difficult to represent as the slimy pileus of A.
mncidns.
Some of the 
fungi figured are of considerable beauty, and of these the most striking 
are, perhaps^ GompJiidius glutinosns var.
roseus, Cortinarius dibaphus and 
carulescens, ami Boletus calopus.
Coprinus lagopus also is extremely 
elegant.
A few places will be found in which the text and the plates are 
not quite in accord, and to which it may be worth while to call attention.
The gills of /-Igaricus sinnpizans and Cortinarius stillatitius are described 
as emaiginate, but the sections (plates 2 and 3) do not exhibit this struc- 
ture, and the same remark applies to Cortinarius caniuus (pi.
15).
The 
stem of Boletus pachypus, as shown in the drawing (pi.
17), cannot be 
called reticulated.
In Agaricus dispersus (pi.
24) the stem is described 
in the text as about two inches long, but if the stems in the drawing are 
measured, they will be found to be very nearly seven inches in length.
It 
may be doubted whether the pileus in A.
hydrophilus is not rather too 
darkly-coloured ; but it is stated that the specimens were gathered after 
much rain, which may account for a departure from the normal tint.
In 
conclusion, it is much to be hoped that this most useful and interesting 
publication may meet with sufficient support to enable its energetic 
editors to issue further parts in quick succession.

ON HYBRIDirY IN SALTX, AND THE GROWTH OP 
WILLOWS FROM SEED.
By Rev. J.
E. Lkefe, M.A., F.L.S.
It would, I think, be iuterestino^ if such of the readers of the ' Journal 
of Botany ' as have had opportunities of forming an opinion, would record 
their observations on tlie growth of Willows from seed.
The whole theory 
as to the production of hybrids in this genus must depend upon their 
growth from seed.
If they do not spring readily from seed, then the 
nice distinctions which separate closely allied forms, must be accounted 
for in some other way than by crossing.
The evidence on the subject seems to me as yet far from conclusive ; 
still it is in some cases so positive that I by no means venture to say 
that seedling Willows are not to be met with.
It is fortunate that, owing 
to W^illows being so readily propagated by cuttings, little inconvenience 
will arise to cultivators should there prove to be generally a paucity of 
seedlings.
I wish now, without bringing forward any theory on the sub- 
ject, to mention what I have collected from books, or from inquiries 
amongst my botanical friends, or from my own observations as a collector 
of Willows now for many years.
Wiramer adopts thoroughly the idea of 
hybrids, therefore of seedlings, but I am not able to quote his exact words, 
having failed, through the booksellers, to obtain a copy of his interesting 
work.* He says, I believe, that the great botanist Pries has to some 
extent become a convert to his views.
The late Professor Koch, in his ' Commentary on the European Willows,' 
anno 1828, p.
9, remarks " Non ea difficultas sola turbat botaniciim in 
hoc genere plantarum, qnpe in partium mutatione et vicissitudinibus 
cernitur, alia ei creatur molestia in hybridarum copia, quas in hoc genere 
exstare addubitari nequit." He then proceeds to instance the numerous 
forms growing near Erlangen, intermediate between S.
mhra, Huds., and 
S. viminaUs, L., forms partaking so much of the characters of both species 
as to make it difficult to refer specimens to one of these species rather 
than tlie otlier.
I am indebted to the kindness of Prof.
Koch for a most 
valuable collection of Willows grown in the arboretum at Erlangen, and, 
amono-st the rest, for a specimen of one of the forms above referred to.
I 
should myself consider this particular specimen to be a remarkably pubescent 
state of S.
rubra, Huds., which the catkins appear most nearly to resem- 
ble, while the pubescence of the leaves docs not show the silkiness of the 
viminales.
I do not know how far Prof.
Koch retained to the last his 
early views as to the hybrid growth of Willows.
In his ' Synopsis,' bearing- 
date 1837, there is no allusion, I think, to hybrids between the species 
above mentioned.
Moreover, whetiier or no Fries has of late a(lo])ted, 
even partially, Wimnier's very pronounced views, I have not the mean* of 
knowing; but in his ' Mantissa,' extending to the year 1842, pp.
559-60, 
he combats this view.
" Innumeras porro vidi Salices hybridas dictas ; 
an ulla vero certa experientia hybrida sit comprobata, equidem nescio?" 
At p.
100 he observes, ' magis vero perniciosam censcmus nimis credulam

idea celata, indeque saepe ignorantise refugiura.' Thus it 
appears that at the date of the ' Coutiuuatio Florse Suecicse,' 1832-1842, 
Prof.
Fries did not regard with favour the view that slight differences 
between closel}' allied Willows are due to hybrid intermixture.
This does 
not, however, indicate what Prof.
Fries' opinion is as to the growth of 
Willows from seed.
Turning now to another quarter, it is not a little remarkable how 
positive in the affirmative was the language of the late Sir J.
E, Smith, 
first, that Willows do grow readily from seed; and secondly, that the 
seedlings were always true to their kinds.
Speaking of Mr. Crowe's 
garden, Eng. Fl.
vol.
iv.
p. 164, he says, "Seedlings innumerable 
springing up all over the ground, were never destroyed till their species 
were determined and the immutability of each verified by our joint in- 
spection.
This was the more material to set aside the gratuitous suppo- 
sition of the mixture of species, or the production of new or hybrid ones, 
of which, no more than of any change in established species, I have never 
met with an instance." Such statements from such a quarter must demand 
the utmost attention.
Perhaps the seedlings, as they sprang up, were 
removed to beds prepared for them, otherwise one cannot but be struck 
by the practical difficulty of keeping the ground clear of weeds without 
destroying the young plants.
Two years' growth, at the very least, would 
be required before the species of the seedlings could be determined, and 
in that time, unless the seedlings were transplanted, which is not stated, 
the Willow ground must have been in great danger of becoming a wilder- 
ness.
On the same subject, Reichenbach, Fl. Excursoria, p.
173, remarks 
" absque dubio specierum enumeratarum quaedam hybridae." Wishing 
to ascertain the opinions of competent persons, I have consulted some of 
my friends who have bestowed much attention upon this tribe.
The 
Eev. L.
Darwall, who has long cultivated Willows, observes, " Amongst 
seedlings I have never found any but S.
caprea and 5.
aqiiatica (including, 
perhaps, S.
cinerea and S.
oleifolia), though I have both sexes of many 
other species.
With this the opinion of my friend Mr. James Ward, 
who has specially studied the Willows for a long series of years, substan- 
tially coincides.
Prof.
Balfour tells me that they have tried, without 
success, to raise willows from seed in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden.
To come now to my own experience ; excepting S.
cap-ea, I do not ever 
remember to have met with a Willow where it looked like a seedling, and 
this was in the shrubbery at Audley End, Essex, where the plant might 
have been inserted as a cutting by some one of the gardeners.
1 have 
myself cultivated the Willows somewhat extensively since the year 1838.
First in the nursery garden at Audley End for about five years, then in 
the Rectory Gardens at Bishopwearmouth, in the county of Durham, for 
say about four years, and for a year more in a garden in the neighbourhood 
of the town of Sunderland, lastly, for fully twenty-one years at Cress- 
well.
For the last twenty-one years the plants, some of them now trees, 
have been growing under my own eyes, great care being taken to keep 
them properly labelled, which is no easy matter.
In all that time I have 
never seen a single seedling, though my collection comprises fully one 
hundred forms.
It is, T admit, barely possible that seedlings may have 
sprung up, and been destroyed in keeping down weeds, but if so, I cannot

account for their not occurring- in undisturbed parts of the garden and 
grounds, amongst shrubs and trees, where seedling Sycamores are frequent, 
and plants of the Leycesteria forniosa have several times sprung up.
A 
few years ago I collected and sowed some seed in pots in my greenhouse, 
and kept them carefully watered and looked after, but the seed did not 
vegetate.
Last year (1870) I made a more systematic attempt, both to 
produce hybrids and raise Willows from seed.
On the 11th of last 
August I sowed, in three boxes filled with good compost, seeds of the 
following kinds : — S.
Forsteriana from Borrer ; S.
Anderso7iiana, Borrer ; 
S. Do)iiana, Borrer ; S.
Sinithiana, E.
Bot.
-S'.
Sm'itluana growing in 
the middle of a large bush of a monandrous Willow allied to S.
Lam- 
bertlana, Sm. I also carefully tied a bunch of the male catkins of S.
daphnoides, VilL, to a branch of a female of ^S".
pomeranlca, W., dusting 
the stigmas at the same time with the pollen.
In a similar manner I 
endeavoured to fertilize the female of S.
stipulmis, Sm., with the pollen 
of the male of S.
rugosa, Borrer ; also the female of S.
Pontedei'aiia, 
Sell., with the catkins of a beautiful Willow gathered near Rothbury in 
Northumberland, which I take to be the male of that species.
The third 
box was filled with seed of difi'erent forms of S.
repetis, L., including, 
probably, S.
amhigna, Ehrli., sent to me by a friend from Horncastle in 
Lincolnshire.
On all those branches, the catkins of which I endeavoured 
to fertilize artificially, seed was produced in abundance.
The boxes were 
carefully watered all through the summer, and in winter were placed in a 
cold frame.
I have examined them constantly up to the present time, 
and at first thought that some of the seeds springing up in them would 
prove to be Willows, but in this hope I have been disappointed, and now 
fear that the experiment has again been a failure.
Last year the seed of 
the Willows was more copiously produced than usual, and becanu; rather 
an annoyance in the beds and walks, but I have not seen a seedling any- 
where.
Although, then, I dare not say that Willows are never produced 
from seed, I think it is clear that this happens less frequently than is 
commonly supposed.
My garden is about a mile and a half from the 
sea, and rather exposed to the north and north-west; but the soil is good 
(old grass land), and most of the Willows grow freely in it.
I have lost 
far more kinds from crowding than from climate.
Having thus failed myself, I would invite the remarks and co-operation 
of others who, in more favourable and southern situations, may be more 
successful than I have been ill raising Willows from seed.
THE FLORA OF HYUE PARK AND KENSINGTON 
GARDENS.
By Hon. J.
L. Warren, M.A.
This paper will not interest botanists to whom the rarity of a plant is 
its main recommendation.
We deal here with our common and widely- 
diffused species.
We endeavour by a contrast of records, new and old, 
to show the surprising permanence of many species, even in the midst 
of the smoke and other hostile influences of a great city.
We remind the 
town-botanist, whom want of time and cash will not allow many country 
excursions, that a fair section of his native flora mav be seen at his very 
Q 2

doors, and studied without the help of a railway-ticket.
This list may 
also prove acceptable as an attempt to throw together the floral records 
of our chief London breathing-place, and as a means of bringing up to 
a modern date the occurrence in Hyde Park of many species, uncon- 
firmed there since early in the present century or even an anterior one.
All notice of trees is omitted in the present list.
It might be interest- 
ing to give a list of such of these as have produced seedlings, as many 
have done ; but it would hardly come within the scope of this paper to 
do so.
In many flower-beds seedling Rubl occur, a curious commentary 
on an idea once held that Ruhus was seldom propagated thus.
There are 
also to be found in the ' Flora of Middlesex ' some curious notes on the 
age and species of several trees in our limits.
Saynbiicns nigra and Salix 
viminaUs, S.
frnr/ilis and S.
triandra, occur in the gardens, but their claims 
are slender to admission in our Flora.
Hedera, Cratagus, Digitalis, etc., 
occur, but all clearly through human agency.
The most interesting plants 
in Hyde Park grow mainly in two pieces of ground.
One is a strip of turf, 
of no great extent, beginning north of the Magazine and lying between the 
King Road and the ditch bounding Kensington Gardens on the west.
Here Trifoliiim glomeratum, Ornifhopus, Carex mnricata, etc., gi'ow, and 
here Moenchia and Ciiscida used to be found.
. I call this ground " the 
strip " sometimes for brevity in my list.
The other noteworthy slip of 
turf begins at the end of a black wooden wall which runs south of the bar- 
racks to near the Humane Society's Receiving House and the Deputy 
Ranger's House opposite the Serpentine.
It consists of the site of a road 
now grassed over, and runs west towards the Magazine, say, for about 
two hundred yards.
Here Sagina ciliata, Plantago Coronopus, Festuca 
bromoidcs, and Trifoliiim filiforme may be found without much trouble.* 
It is most important in the present flora to specify, if the species was 
gathered in the open and apparently original turf, or whether it grew 
within the limits of artificial enclosure, in a flower-bed, in the circular 
hurdles used to pi'otect the trees from sheep, or in newly-sown grass- 
land.
Plants in the first category alone (excepting, of course, the 
aquatics) ought •prima facie to be reckoned natives in this list, though 
plants which nearly always follow horticulture, like Solanum nigrum, may 
be just as native (or un-native) in a Kensington Garden flower-bed as in 
a Devonian cottage garden.
What is meant may be shown by an 
example : — Chrysantheumm Leucanthemum within our limits is seen about 
thrice in open turf, twenty or thirty times under suspicious circumstances.
Hence, without wishing to dogmatize, I incline to the opinion that this 
species is generally a casual in Hyde Park, however common a native it may 
be elsewhere.
In fact, I would much rather, if possible, have omitted all 
notice in the present list of these flower-bed casuals, and newly-sown turf 
ephemerals, if I may use the expression.
The plants of the genuine open 
park herbage are really the important matter in this record.
What 
species, imported with garden-mould or grass-seeds, may manage to sur- 
* During a former residence in Cheshire, I made a careful list, through many 
years, of every species found within a mile radius of my dwelling-place.
It is 
worth mention that several plants belonging to the present list were absent from 
my Cheshire enumeration, — Tr if uliion glomeratum, Koeleria cristata, Sagina ciliata, 
Hordeum mnri//iim, Hordeum pratense, Senebiera Coronopics, and Arenaria serpylli- 
folia.
The first three absences are likely enough, but the last four may surprise 
many a south country reader.
THE FLORA OF HYDE PARK AND KENSINGTON GARDENS.

vive a mouth or two is quite of secondary importance.
Our list of 
' casuals' miglit doubtless, with constant observation for a season or two, 
be run up to 200 or 300 species, but such a list, even when completed, 
would afford us curious rather than valuable information ; but, tliough I 
would gladly have disencumbered myself of these casuals, this list might 
mislead if this were done, since several species appear, I conceive, in the 
Gardens and in newly-sown places, in the character of casuals ; and also 
in the Park turf in that of natives.
Chrymnthemum Leucanthemum and 
Plantago lanceolata may be quoted as examples.
Besides, in many in- 
stances, it is nearly impossible to say to which category a given species 
is to be referred ; and, lastly, if we rigidly excluded flower-bed weeds, 
we should have to condemn such plants as Veronica jmlita and Lamium 
2)iirpnreum, which, as has been said above, are as much native here as 
in any provincial district.- Thus, from the wish to enter no more plants 
of this kind than absolutely necessary, I have deemed it more tech- 
nically correct to exclude, as literally just outside our limits, an interest- 
ing number of species observed on the Gore at Kensington by the authors 
of the 'Flora of Middlesex,' to which I beg to refer the reader.
In 
conclusion, this list, which contains about 190 species, is manifestly im- 
perfect.
Conscious of this, I only hope its publication may induce some 
one to amplify and improve upon it.
But 1 venture to trust that any 
botanist to whom this list is the means of indicating any Park rarities 
will refrain from rooting up specimens.
All my records of plants apply to the present summer (.Tune and July, 
1871) unless I distinctly specify otherwise.
Later in the year such genera 
as Bidem, Ckenopodium, and Poly(jonum would be more fully represented.
All records beyond my personal obseiTation are accompanied by the 
name of the authority, which is in nearly every case Trimen and Dyer's 
'Flora of Middlesex.' The abbreviations used are, — Fl. of M.=' Flora 
of Middlesex ;' P.:==Hyde Park ; G.=Kensington Gardens.
The names 
used are those of the ' London Catalogue.'

ON THE GENUS FALLOPIA, Lour.
By H.
F. Hance, Ph.D.
In his ' Flora Cochinchinensis,' published at Lisbon in 1790, Loureiro 
described, under the name of FaUopia nervosa, a small tree which he 
referred to the Linngean class and Order Polyandria Monogynia, with the 
following generic character: — " Calyx communis 12-phyllus, foliolis lan- 
ceolato-linearibus deciduis, continens 3 flosculos.
Perianthium proprium 
nullum.
Petala 5, ovata, subpatentia, calyce longiora.
Nectariuin foliolis 
5, ovato-oblongis, parvulis, erectis, sequalibus.
Starainum filamenta 50 
circiter, filiformia, iufequalia, receptaculo inhserentia ; antherse subrotundse.
Germen subrotundum, siiperum ; stylus crassus, subulatus, brevior slami- 
nibus ; stigma simplex.
. Bacca subrotuuda, 1-locularis, 4-sperma.
Se- 
mina subrotunda." He states it to inhabit waste places around Canton, 
and to be about eight feet high, with spreading branches, a tenacious 
hemp-like bark, ovate-lanceolate nerved subserrate smooth leaves, and 
white flowers in small terminal clusters.
Willdenow, who republished the work at Berlin three years later, added 
notes, with a view to correct the faulty determinations of Loureiro, and to 
reduce to their proper places as synonyms the many genera erroneously 
described by him as new.
Since, however, he passes over FaUopia with- 
out any observation (i.
109), it is evident he could make nothing of it.
Nor do subsequent botanists appear to have been more successful.
I 
have searched for it in vain in De Candolle's ' Prodromus,' Bartling's 
' Ordines,' Eeichenbach's ' Conspectus ' and ' Repertorium Herbarii,' 
Perleb's ' Clavis,' Endlicher's ' Genera ' and ' Enchiridion,' Lindley's 
* Natural System ' and ' Vegetable Kingdom,' Meissner's ' Genera,' 
Dietrich's ' Synopsis Plantarum,' and Bentham and Hooker's ' Genera ; ' 
and I believe I am correct in saying that it has escaped the notice of all 
modern systeraatists, and so to say, slipped out of memory, being found 
neither as a received genus, a synonym, or even relegated to the limbo of 
" plantae incertse sedis," in any classification of the vegetable kingdom.
The only reference to it with which I am acquainted is in the ' Cliinese 
Chrestomathy ' of the late Rev. Dr.
Bridgman, published at Macao in 
1841, where it is mentioned (p.
458) as growing wild on the islands near 
Macao ; and it is added that the leaves are gathered by the Chinese as a 
substitute for tea.
I had long been greatly perplexed as to the shrub intended, and had 
for several years made from time to time fruitless efforts to discover it ; 
and it is only quite recently that inquiries instituted by friends amongst 
the Canton herbalists have resulted in Grewia Mlcrocos, L., being pro- 
duced as the plant known by the Chinese name given by Loureiro.
The 
characters assigned to FaUopia, through a misconception of the floral 
structure, by Loureiro, would have scarcely led one to suspect this to be 
the plant intended by him, but I have no doubt such is the case ; and, 
when these characters are properly interpreted, they will be found to 
agree very well.
Thus, the 'calyx communis' is the involucre, the 
number of whose component bracts is not mentioned by De CandoUe, 
Koxburgh, Wight and Ariiott or IMiquel, but stated by Dietrich (Synops.
Plant, iv.
238) to be 7, and by Bentham (Fl. Hongk.
42) to be 3 to 6, 
but which I find 8 to 10, and some of these not unfrequently laciniate or 
240 STATIONS OF, AND REMARKS ON, SOME PLYMOUTH PLANTS.
bifid ; the ' flosculi ' are the flowers, usually, as stated, teruate ; the 
sepals, being coloured internally, were mistaken for petals ; and the petals 
themselves, being less than half as long the sepals, and furnished with a 
foveola and gland, were described as ' nectarii foveola.' The fruit is ia 
reality a drupe, composed of three confluent 1-celled 1-seeded pyrense ; 
and it must have been imperfect examination which led Loureiro to 
describe it as 1-celled and 4-seeded.
His account of the habit and 
specific characters of the plant is good.
Its employment, recorded by 
Dr. Bn'dfiman, by the poorer Chinese as a succedaneum for tea, seems 
dictated by a not unwise instinct, since Endlicher observes (Enchirid.
Bot. 524) : " Grewia Microcos cortice amaro-aromatico foliisque adstriu- 
gentibus commendatur." 
It follows from the above that Jrsis nujosa, Lour., given by all writers 
as a synonym of Grewia Microcos, must be a different plant.
To judj^e 
from the description, it is most likely a Grewia with exinvolucrate cyraules, 
belonging to the section OmpJiacarpus*

Ranuncnhis avricomns, L.
This is local about Plymouth, and it 
seems that very few stations are recorded for it across the Tamar, in 
Cornwall.
It occurs in the east of this county, on a bank (for about 
twenty yards) by the Torpoint and Liskeard turnpike, close to the en- 
trance gate to Sconner House grounds ; also, but very sparingly, by the 
same road, close to the seventh milestone from Torpoint.
'Ranunculus hirsntns, Curt.
Sometimes this appears only as a casual 
in waste spots by salt water and in arable land, but it is at least a 
colonist at St. John's, Cornwall, about four miles from Plymouth ; and 
this summer (1871) I have found it so plentiful in a marsh at the head 
of Denabole " Lake," a tidal inlet from the Lynher, in the same county, 
that I should consider it a native if there were not a flour-mill near.
In 
May, 1868, it occurred in damp spots in a lane near a farmhouse, a little 
to the north-west of Battisborough Cross, as well as in a field near.
The 
lighter hue of both its foliage and flowers renders it distinguishable from 
R. bulbosus and R.
repens at some ilistance.

This is generally seeti growing in a patch or

Sedum Telepkiuni., a species very frequently met with close to old farm-

being more glabrous, having fewer- flowered panicles and smaller leaves.

Saltash, in the same county, where it was first fouiifl by my friend Mr.

near Bnrrington House, Weston Peverell, Devon, it appears witii Nar- 
cissus bifiorus and a semi-double form of N.
poeticiis.
Herheris vuJffaris, L.
Mostly in hedgerows near gardens or by houses, 
but I consider this shrub indigenous in a few spots, as by a creek from 
St. John's " Lake," Cornwall, whence I have previously recorded it.
It 
may be wild, also, in a hedgerow between Widey and Egg Buckland 
vicarage, where it extends for about two or three yards ; there is also a 
single bush on the side of a hedgebank by a field above the valley to the 
west of Egg Buckland church.
Papaver dubium, L.
The common representative of this about Ply- 
month seems to be P.
Lamottei, Bor.
; but, if Professor Babington's 
character of the "sap becoming dark yellow in the air" be decisive to 
mark P.
Lecoqii, Lamotte, we have the latter also, as the sap of a Poppy 
now growing at Lipson has unquestionably this property , unlike that of 
all the other long-headed Poppies that 1 have tried.
I cannot, however, 
find any other g0')d mark of distinction between this Lipson plant and 
the others, although in it the contraction of the capsule above the torus 
seems rather greater than in those of them with which I have com- 
pared it.
Hypericum bfeficHiii, Boiss.

undalatum, Schousb.
This occurs 
rather plentifully in boggy spots surrounded by copse-wood at Warleigh, 
about five miles from Plymouth.

first met with it last year, is the banks of a small tributary of the Yealm, 
on the southern border of Dartmoor; but there it grows only sparingly,

Growing abundantly from between stones against a bank at Holes Hole, 
in the parish of Beer Ferris^by the side of the (at that spot) tidal Tamar, 
June, 1871.
At a distance this looks almost intermediate between typi- 
cal Robertianum and G.

stems, and nearly glabrous condition.
Medicago deidicnlata, Willd.
Not general even on the coast, but there 
I consider it indigenous.
Plentiful in grassy spots about a clitf at Port 
Wrincle, Whitsand Bay, Cornwall, May, 1871; also on a bank on the 
Devon side of the Tamar at Holes Hole, growing with Salvia verbenaca, 
June, 1871.
Trif/otiella ornithopodloidcs, De Cand.
This occurs in too many locali- 
ties about Plymouth to be considered rare, though its maritime tendencies 
render it local.
Noticed this year (1871) at the following unrecorded 
stations : — Crabtree, Devon ; Port Wrincle and TrevoUard, Cornwall, — 
at the last place associated with Mwnchia erecta, Trifolinm subterraneuni, 
and Ornithopas perpusillus, species that it often grows with.

in another part of this wood are six more small trees or bushes, the 
largest of them from 15 to 20 ft.
high; and in a thii'd spot are three or 
four from 5 to 7 ft.
high.
Scleranthns annuiis, L.
Quite a rare species around Plymouth.
In a 
waste spot by the junction of two lanes, lying between the Saltash and 
Callington Eoad and the Moditon Mill and Pillaton Eoad, May, 1866, 
and again seen in 1870; on TrevoUard Green, May, 1871.
These are 
the only stations at which I have ever seen it in East Cornwall ; and 
elsewhere, about Plymouth, I have found it in only three or four places.
Traf/opogou pratetisis, L.
On taking the relative length of the florets 
and phyllaries as a means for distinguishing the forms of this from one 
another, I find that the Plymouth examples belong mostly to jB.
minor.
Pries, Syme ; but the form a.
(jenninus, Syme, with florets about equal in 
length to the phyllaries, occurs on a bank by the footpath between Ply- 
mouth and Laira Bridge.
It differs, however, from Babington's descrip- 
tion in having brown, not yellow, anthers.
I have never met with the 
form y.
gymuJiflorus, Syme, 
Inula Ilelenium, L.
Three small patches on a bank close to the lawn 
of Trevollard House, Cornwall ; very near are bushes of Berberis vulgaris, 
extending for eight or nine yards.
Both this shrub and the Luda were 
doubtless originally introduced there.
Leouuras Cardiaca, L.
Three plants on Trevollard Green, Cornwall, 
May, 1871.
Chenopodium Bonus- Ilenricus, L.
A few patches of this denizen grow 
by a wall near the church at St. Stephen's-by-Saltash, Cornwall.
The 
locality produces Malva rotundifolia, a plant rather rare about Plymouth, 
and confined, in a remarkable way, to situations about old farmho\ises or 
villaj^es.
Avena pubescens, L.
Local and rare.
In shallow soil on limestone 
rook, in waste spots between Hay Farm and Elburton, associated with 
Briza media, L.
Lastrea spijiulosa, Presl.
In most places about some of the small tri- 
butaries of the Plvni, between Long Bridge and Bickleioh ; in boo-o-v 
spots in VVarleigh Wood, sparingly.
Ophioglossuia vulgatum, L.
Many dozens of specimens in a damp spot 
in a small wood in the parish of Egg Buckland, April, 1871.
Tolerably 
plentiful in peaty depressions in a pasture by Crownhill Down, June, 
1871.
In the same enclosure I noticed about a dozen specimens of Bo- 
trychium Liinaria,'^w.,—ii species almost certain to occur with the Ophio- 
glosswn.
Both seem to grow more in old pastures that have had their 
surface disturbed at some distant date, than on the unenclosed and un- 
broken commons.
The places mentioned above are in Devon, unless the contrary is stated.

SisYiuNCHiuM Bermudiana, L.
— There is a rumour (see ' Gar- 
deners' Chronicle,' 1871, pp.
901 and 937) that this Irish native (see 
Journ.
of Bot. VIII.
p. 253) has been recently collected in a wild 
state on the coast of Hampshire, near Christchurch.
" The plant grows 
in one jinrt of a wood, within a radius of ten or fifteen yards, where it is

pretty abundant.
It gTows amongst low, thick oak underwood, and long 
rank grass, the place being a moist one, and near a small running stream 
which comes from the direction of the New Forest.
There is a small 
cottage and garden near the edge of the wood, about 100 j'ards from the 
place where the Siy/rinchiiim is found to the northward, the prevailing 
wind being W.S.W." I have not been successful in obtaining any fur- 
ther information tlian that a specimen of the plant, alleged to have been 
collected in the locality, was sent to the editor of the ' Chronicle.' If it 
prove a native in Hants, it will be a very interesting addition to the flora 
of a remarkable district of England, which is rich in rarities, and contains 
the only British locality for another Irish species, the Simethis bicolor, 
Kunth.
By the way, botanists rarely write the name of this species cor- 
rectly.
Its old name (Dillenius's) was Berriiudiayia gramlnea fore minore 
cisrideo, and Linnaeus, as was frequently his practice, adopted the previous 
appellation as a specific name (Sp. Plant.
1353).
A parallel case is 
Lythrmn HyssopifuHa, L, ; here, as in the Sisyrinchinm^ the trivial name 
is not ail adjective term, but a substantive, and the original name of the 
plant.

British Plants under Culture.
— Few persons have any concep- 
tion of the ornamental capabilities of many of our indigenous plants.
It 
is remarkable, however, how much can l)e done with them, if they are 
grown with a little care.
At the Ilorticulturjil Society, July 19tl), Mr.
Parker took the first prize for a group of hardy perennials grown in 13- 
inch pots.
Several of the plants were natives, sucii as Armeria planla- 
ginea, Centranthus ruber, var.
albiis, and Potentilla reptatis, flore pleno.
Others, such as Veronica maritima and Betonica hirsMta, could probably 
be equalled in effectiveness by native species allied to them, such as Fe- 
ronica spicata and BetonJca officinalis.
The plants were about 18 inches 
tlirough, and under 2 feet in height, clothed with foliage to the pots, and 
covered with flowers.
Many exotics look far less attractive than these 
wild plants.
It was curious to notice how cultivation had restrained and 
toned down coarseness of growth, and given that air of unweed-like 
refinement characteristic of all garden-grown plants.

[At the last show of the Royal Botanic Society, I was equally 
struck with the elegant and beautiful appearance of a tall-growing, white- 
flowered form of Campanula rotuncUfoIia grown in pots and in profuse 
blossom.— HiiNRY Trimen.] 
Surrey Casuals.
— In April this year I found in a field of Clover and 
Grass, about a mde south of Gomshall, Surrey (between Guildford and 
Dorking), Fero)dca Iriphyllos, Gamelina saliva, and Alyssum calyriuuni.
Tiiis Veronica has not, 1 think, been noticed before in Surrey ; only one 
specimen was found.
All were, doubtless, introduced.— F.

Galium tricorne, L.
— I enclose a specimen of this species, which I 
gathered on the bank of the new road through the brickfields, behiryl St.
Augustine's Church, Stoke Newington, at the beginning of this month, 
July, 1871.

SUBULARIA AQUATICA, L., IN MERIONETHSHIRE.
— It is stated in 
Syme's ' Eug-lisli Botany,' vol.
i. p.
201, that " Caniarvonshire and An- 
glesea seem to be the only English localities " for this plant.
It may, 
therefore, be interesting- to record its existence in the county of Merioneth.
I gathered it on July lOlh, at Cwm Bychan, in the mountain range noi'th- 
east of Barmouth, where it grows at the lower end of the lake, in com- 
pany with Lobelia Dorti)ianna.
There can be no reason why it should 
not be found in other of the numerous lakes which stud the county of 
Merioneth.

Monstrosity of Viola sylvatica.
— The Rev. H.
N. EUacombe, 
rector of Bitton, near Bristol, one of our most successful and experienced 
cultivators of hardy flowering plants, has just shown me a monstrosity of 
the common Dog-violet, produced in his garden under singular circum- 
stances.
The plant of the Violet came up accidentally amongst specimens 
of the cristate form of Lastrea Filix-mas, and many of its leaves had be- 
come abnormally dilated, and at the same time plaited and crisped, after 
tlie fashion of the pinnaj of the Fern.
It produced flowers and fruit, and 
has been reproduced from seed.
Is it possible that the peculiarity has 
been conveyed from the Eern to the Violet ?
The two grew in close 
contact.
A specimen of the Violet has been dried for the Kew herbarium.

Cybele {vide p.

— With regard to the penultimate syllable of the 
word Cybele, it may be remarked that its f[uantity as a Greek word is 
indisputably short.
The Virgilian dilliculty may be got over by reading 
the form used occasionally by Herodotus — Cybebe ; or as is quite allow- 
able in poetry (witness the constant practice of Homer), doubling the I —

localities in tiu; neighbourhood of Stourbridge, viz.
at Pedmore Common, 
in the parish of Pedmore, and near the Birches, in the parish of Hagle}^ 
T have since gathered it in fine fruit at the latter place.
It has not, so

Monstrous State of Cardamine amara.
— Early in June this year 
Mr. James Britten and I found in a wood at Morley, Cheshire, a great 
number of very remarkable flowers of Cardamine amara, in which the 
petals were persistent, and were of a rich purple colour.
These flowers

were unexpanded, and of a solid, globular form ; and we, at first, supposed 
they were buds that would eventually open out into double flowers, such 
as are not uufrequently met with in Cardamine pratensis.
On examination, 
however, this abnormal development was found to be due to the attack of 
minute insects, small yellow grubs, very similar to the larvfe of the Wheat 
Midge {Cecidomya Tritici), that are so often found amongst the chafF scales 
of wheat.
Each flower contained a dozen or more of the parasites.
The 
flowers themselves had become strangely altered.
The sepals were thickened 
and otherwise somewhat enlarged, green and persistent ; the petals pei-- 
sistent, unaltered iu texture but purple in colour ; the filaments mur-h 
swollen, but the anthers quite unaltered ; and tlie pistil considerably 
enlarged.
The peculiar thickening of the pai'ts of the flower was, no 
doubt, due to the puncture of the parent insect when she deposited her 
eggs, as is the case in- all kinds of galls, rather than to the efl'ect of the 
larvae feeding on the juices of the flower.
In fact, the flower was partially 
converted into a gall, — a nidus for the young brood of insects ; but it is 
sti-ange that an injury of this kind should have caused such a very marked 
change in the colour of the petals.
— Robert Holland.
Stellakia umbrosa, " Oj)itz." — I found this well-marked and striking 
form of Stdlaria media in June last, growing abundantly in and near 
Morley Wood, near Mobberley, Cheshire, as well as in one or two other 
places in the neighbourhood.
It is stated in Eng. Bot.
ed.
3. ii.
95, to 
be of rare occurrence, and to be " most probably a sub-species," in which 
opinion I concur.
Besides the characters there given, the size of the 
flowers — about midway between those of typical S.
media and S.
nemorum 
— would at once attract the attention even of a casual observer.

Dracocephalum tiiymiflorum, L.
— T am not aware that this plant 
has been previously recorded as an introduction ; but have lately received 
a specimen gathered in a clover-field near High Wycombe, Bucks.
I am 
informed that there were several large plants of it in this locality ; and 
from the same field I have since YCceyvitAFarsetia iticana and i\\\ Authemis, 
probably A.
tinctoria, but the specimens were too young for positive 
determination.
The Dracocephalum.
is a north and east European species.

Economical Use of Scirpus lacustris and of S.
maritimus.
— It may be worth notice that the soft culms of S.
lacustris are largely 
used in the manufacture of casks for the purpose of caulking the spaces 
between the staves and between the boards of the heads of the barrels.
Another Scirpus, S.
maritiiims, may be mentioned as supplying from the 
tubers of its rhizome a part of the food during winter of the grev-leg 
wild goose, Anser ferus.
My frieiul Mr. Basil Brooke found in the crops 
of some of these wild geese, which he shot during the past season near 
the Murragh of Wicklow, a quantity of the tubers of the Scirpus, which 
abounds in this locality.
Withering tells us that the roots of S.
maritimus 
dried and ground to powder have been used instead of flour in times of 
scarcity.

AcoRUS Calamus {vide p.
163).
— In liis account of tlie history of 
Acorns Calamus, M.
Davos has only imperfectly acknowledg-ed how much 
he was indebted for information to the researches of the late F.
Kirschleger, 
who, in his ' Flore d'Alsace' (1857), not only pronounces decidedly aoaiiist 
its nativity in the Rhine A^alley, but also applies a large amount of infor- 
mation collected from the older writers, upon which his opinion was 
founded.
As the merit of tracing the history of the plant in western 
Europe clearly belongs to Kirschleger, and as his book is very little 
known in England, it seems worth while translating the following passage 
from the ' Flore d'Alsace,' ii.
p. 211 : — " Notwithstanding this wide distri- 
bution in the Rhine countries, the Acorns is not spontaneous there.
In 
the sixteenth century this plant did not exist in middle and western 
Europe, ' Omnino hoc Acoro caremus,' says V.
Cordus.
Tragus was not 
acquainted with it.
Camerarius only speaks of it as an exotic drug ; he 
says, " Nascitur in Ponto, Colchide et Galatia." Clusius, in 1574, had 
received living plants of Calamus aromaticus from Constantinople ; he 
was then cultivating it in the basins of the Garden of Vienna, where it 
was fiist increasing, and whence it was being distributed to various 
European gardens.
Similarly, J.
Bauliin tells us that in 1590 he was 
cultivating the Acorns in the garden of the Electoral Montbt51iard, having 
brought it from the gardens at Stuttgardt, to which it had been intro- 
duced from the garden of the Margrave of Baden at Pforzeira ; that, at 
Strasbourg, Melchior was cultivating it in 1591 in his garden, as was 
also Robin in the Jardin du Roy at Paris.
J. Bauhin describes the mode 
of cultivation in damp sand near the reservoirs and trenches.
It appears 
that Sebitz introduced the Acorus at Strasbourg, and J.
Bauhin at i\iont- 
beliard and at Belfort.
From the time of Lindern and of Mappus 
(1710-1750) it was very abundant in the neiglibourhood of Strasbourg, 
to such an extent that Mappus was able to write ' Acorus, regiouuni 
se|)tentrionalium incola, in Gallia non reperitur, quo tamen nostrte 
Al-iatiae, isti regioni licet vicinse, abunde prospexit natura." Thu*, ac- 
cording to Mappus, it is Nature, and not the hand of Man, which has 
endowed our countries with the Calamus aromaticus.
Even Haller (in 
his 'Enumeratio' and ' Historia ') does not seem to question that the 
Acorus was indigenous ; and even in modern times few florists, such as 
Dierbach (Flor.
Heidelb.) and Schubler (Flor.
Wiirtemb.), are satisfied of 
its exotic origin.
By Linnaeus (Flor.
Suecica) it is described as growing 
' copiose in fossis Scania?,' and by Ledebour in the northern provinces of 
Russia." — A.

THE TREES IN KEW GARDENS.
The following valuable notes are from Dr. Hooker's ' Report on the Pro- 
gress and Condition of the Royal Gardens at Kew during the year 1870 :' 
— " The effects of the long and severe summer's drought on the old trees 
have been disastrous; they have perished by hundreds — Elms, Ashes, 
Beeches, and Sycamores especially ; many, no doubt, from having ap- 
jjroached the limits of the age which such trees attain on so excessively 
poor a soil as that of Kew, but more, perhaps, through having been drawn 
up in thick plantations, and thus starved from the first.
In ])ursuance 
of the Board's directions, active steps have been taken to clear large 
areas of dying and dead trees, to trench the ground and clear it of old 
roots, and plant closely a mixture of young trees of all sorts, which will 
be thinned out as they grow.
This operation has enabled me to arrive 
at an approximate estimate of the ages of some of the more common 
trees in these grounds, and of the average duration which the several 
sorts have attained.
The oldest trees in the grounds are undoubiediy 
Oaks, English Elms, and perhaps Hawthorns, of which some of the first 
and last may be relics of the al)original forests that covered this part of 
England; whilst the oldest of the Elms were undoubtedly all planted.
No data have been obtained for ascertaining the age of the Oaks, but 
probably none exceed 300 years, and the majority date from the reign of 
George the Second.
The only large ones that remain are several near 
the Brentford Gate, one near the upper end of the lake, and several near 
the Queen's Cottage grounds.
The largest Englisii Elms of which the 
rings have been counted are about 250 years old, but there are a few 
250 THE TREES IN KEW GAKDENS.
near the Palace gates which have probably attained 300 years.
Of these 
the top of that nearest the oates was blown oti' this winter and the stump 
removed ; but the butt was too far tlecayed for its rings to be counted.
All the old Elms in the grounds and their outskirts are in rows, and were 
either planted along former walks, or came up in hedgerows, and were 
spared when the domain was enclosed and the hedges removed.
Of Elms 
under 200 years old there were innumeral)le examples throughout the 
grounds ; these were for the most part suckers from the roots of older 
Elms, which, coming up amongst the other and better trees, have done 
irreparable damage to them ; the English Elm being of all plants the 
most impoverishing in light soils.
Of the old Hawthorns, the last fine 
one perished during the summer's drought; they abounded at one time 
on the gravelly parts, and appeared to be of the same age as the old 
Eichmond Park Hawthorns.
Beech, Oak, and Maple are the only other 
trees that have sprung up spontaneously in the grounds, and all from 
originally planted trees.
The oldest Beeches were planted in George II.
's 
reign, and are about 150 years old; but of these there are very few 
indeed.
The largest of them is a magnificent tree near the Brentford 
gate, with a trunk 10|^ feet in girth at five feet above the ground; its 
branches, which sweep and root in the ground, form a circle 116 paces in 
circumference.
It is showing signs of decay.
The majority of the 
Beeches, which formed eight-tenths of the arboreous vegetation of Kew, 
are part of an extensive and dense plantation, made about 1750, but 
which, having been wholly neglected during the succeeding hundred years, 
have impoverished one another to such an extent that the majority are 
already diseased and fungused.
It is upon this Beech forest that the 
winter gales and last summer's drought have told most heavily ; the 
majority, having no root-hold, could not resist the blasts, and the losa of 
one is immediately followed by that of its neighbours, both from the 
admission of the wind and from the sun's rays drying and heating the 
surface of the previously-shaded soil over their roots.
Of other trees 
there are several good Limes, Evergreen Oaks, Spanish and Horse- 
Chestnuts, all from 150 to 200 years old ; these trees have thriven well, 
and last long in the soil of Kew. The Ashes, Poplars, Acacias, and 
Willows average only from 100 to 150 years, and the Birches 60 to 80 
years.
The only good Coniferous trees of any age at Kew are Cedars of 
Lebanon and Larches: many of the former were planted about 1750, 
but of these not a dozen remain, the largest having attained a girth 
of eleven feet at five above the ground.
The Spruces, Scotch Firs, 
Pinasters, and Weymouth Pines, have all been ruined by being 
crowded amongst forest trees.
The Hemlock-Spruces, with which 
the path by the Richmond Road was ornamentecl twenty years ago, 
are every one dead ; the last, wdiich stood near the Pagoda, having 
succumbed to the drought of the past summer.
Of Planes there 
never were many ; a few fine orientals, planted in 1740-50, remain in 
the King of Hanover's grounrk, one near the old Palace, and one near the 
Temple of the Sun. The above comprises all the trees of which there 
were any quantity in the grounds previous to their being made over to 
the public in 1845 ; since which time four-fifths have either died or have 
been removed to make way for buildings, avenues, paths, etc.
Between 
1840 and 1865 many efforts were made by my predecessor to keep up

KiCHARD Dkakin, Esq., M.D. Tunbridge Wells and London.
1871.
(Pp.371.) 
There is no doubt that this book will prove a useful one, but it is not 
ns a local Flora that it chiefly claims our attention.
Tunbridge Wells, 
indeed, scarcely needed a new list of its native Phanerogams, for the 
neighbourhood has been exceptionally favoured in this matter.
T. F.
Forster's excellent ' Flora Toubridgensis ' was printed in 1816, and after 
receiving additions from his son Thomas Forster, was again pidjlished in 
1842, and a few years after appeared the ' Flora of Tunbridge Wells,' by 
Mr. E.
Jenner.
But little is added to existing knowledge of the botany 
of this part of Kent and Sussex in the work before us, though localities are 
given for all but the commoner species, and there are several hitherto un- 
published stations for the rarer ones.
Judged by the standard of recent 
attempts to investigate local botany in England, Dr. Deakin's book will 
not occupy a high place, even as an instalment towards a Flora of Kent ; 
but, as hinted above, the ititerest of the work lies in another direction.
Unlike most modern local Floras, descriptions of all the species are given 
in plain language, which, though short, are accurate and sutticient for 
diagnosis.
But the most remarkable feature is the profuseness of ilhis- 
tration ; there are probably not less than 800 woodcuts incorporated with 
the text, representing nearly every species described.
Some readers 
doubtless remember the issue of Dr. Deakin's ' Florigraphia Britanuica ' 
in the years from 1837-184-7, with coloured illustrations placed six on a 
plate separate from the text.
The figures in this Tunbridge Wells Flora 
are the same cuts, but have greatly gained in appearance by being left 
uncoloured and being intercalated with the letterpress.
The censure 
passed upon these figures (of the ' Florigraphia ') by Pritzel is quite un- 
necessarily severe ; though rough and possessing the inconvenience of not 
being drawn to any scale, the general aspect and habit of each species 
has been in nearly all cases very happily laid hold of, rarely leaving one 
in doubt for a moment as to the plant intended.
The use of these alr6ady 
published figures has enabled the publishers to issue the Flora at a very 
low price — ten numbers at one shilling each — and so to bring it readily 
into the reach of many persons who caiuiot buy expensive treatises.
There can be little doubt that it will spread to a considerable extent a

knowledge of the indigenous plants of the district and simplify their 
study ; and if of comparatively slight value to an advanced botanist, is 
just the book to recommend to any one in the neighbourhood commencing 
the investigation of wild plants.
We regret to see a rather large number 
of misprints in the scientific names.
We miss, too, altogether from the 
book Carex montana, one of the most interesting Tuubridge species, — 
an inexplicable omission.

tion to the structural distinctions which seemed to indicate that the 
so-called Frototaxites was rather allied to some Algal form, — he would sug-

There is no appearance of "disks," both 
longitudinal and vertical sections indicating that the mass is composed of 
a number of tubes running in a nearly parallel direction (occasionally bi- 
furcating, according to Professor Arclier), and a])parently not septate or 
tapering, and with an intercellular medium, apparently formed of minor 
tubes.
The principal longitudinal tubes appear on transverse section to 
have a wall concentrically stratified.
Principal Dawson, in describing the 
Devonian rocks of Canada, speaks of the occurrence in the lower beds of 
the system of " trunks of drifted trees in the sandstones, at first sight re- 
sembling those oi Bailoxylun.

. They present," he says, " a regular tissue 
of long cylindrical fibres, marked on their sides with irregular spiral lines, 
and very distinct from tliose of modern Conifers, though their markings 
suggest the spiral lines on the cells of the genus, whence I have taken the 
name Prototaxites for these remarkable trunks.
They have niedullaiy rays 
and regular lines of growth, and attained sometimes a diameter of three 
feet.
Unfortunately, we know nothing of their foliage or fruit, and can but 
suppose that they constitute a prototype of the Coniferous trees, probably 
very different from any known in the modern world." (Proc.

169, 170.) Mr. Carruthers, however, holds the view which 
he stated in a paper read to the British Association in 1S70, that "the 
supposed Taxineous wood from the North American Devonians, to which 
Professor Dawson gave the name of Prototaxites, is a remarkable Alga of 
enormous size" ('Nature,' Oct. 6th, 1870).
Portions of the supposed 
wood sent from Professor Dawson to Mr. Carruthers exhibit characters 
which belong to two very distinct plant-structures.
One consists ex- 
clusively of regular parenchyma ; the other, of which the specimens shown 
to the Cbib were examples, is that to which the description above quoted, 
applies, at least as far as their microscopic characters.
The appearance of 
" medullary rays " is probably produced by accidental cracks or fissures, 
no structure corresponding with them being shown by the microscope.
The " lines of growth " would have their parallel in the pseudo-exogenous 
stems of the existing Alga Lessouia, of which Dr. Hooker remarks (' Flora

This was a state of Erica TatraUx, in which the corolla was partly split

Dr. Sigerson stated that there was the further peculiarity

Professor Thiselton Dyer commnuicated a note on Bud-scales.
He pointed out that in such widely distinct plants as the Lime, Elm, and 
Beech these were formed by the stipules, which were developed far in ad- 
vance of the rest of the leaf, and fell off when it was fully expanded.
This seemed an illustration of the theory that similar structural modifica- 
tions in plants were really only the (effect of similar external conditions.
In more striking instances this would amount to so-called mimicry, which 
was really a totally different phenomenon from what was met with amongst 
animals.
The term " Pseudomorphism " was suggested as a convenient 
substitute for those cases where a plant abandoned the fades of the 
Natural family to which it belonged, and assumed that of another.

Mr. William An- 
drevvs exhibited some specimens of vSaxifrages, chielly of the umhrom and 
Genm species.
Of the Robertsonian saxifrages, which constitute the 
Geum and umbrosa forms, the most remarkable varieties occur, which have 
254 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
been separated Ijy British botanists into Geum, elegans, dentnta, Idrsuta, 
nmljrusa, pimctata, and serrata.
It has been stated that those of the 
Pyrenees are jjeculiarly distinct, and that the forms found in Irehind are 
by no means identical or possessing the same characteristics ; that the 
truly blunt crenate-leaved variety does not exist in Ireland.
The anther 
considered that all the forms of the Eobertsonian saxifrages found in 
Ireland, in the south-west parts at certain elevations, were identical with 
those of similar ranges of elevation in the Pyrenees, and on the mountain 
ranges of Portugal.
The singuhir fact of the peculiarly distinct varieties 
of form of the saxifrages may arise from their proximity to each other.
In testing experiments with the seeds of vmhrosn, he had found that the 
greater number of the seedling plants assumed the Geum form.
All the 
varieties retained their characters permanently when cultivated from otf- 
sets.
In the second edition of the ' British Flora,' by Sir William 
Hooker, the subject of the saxifrages, although fully given, is cautiously 
dilated on, especially with reference to the hypnoid group ; and the 
observMtions of subsequent years have verified the views that were cer- 
tainly then formed, — that the opinions of botanists were very variable as 
to what is and what is not a species.
The connnon form of Saxifraga 
umbrosa of the western parts of Ireland varies much from the true umbrosa 
of the Pyrenees, the former having the leaves obovate, with sharp cartila- 
ginous notches, the latter with the leaves bluntly crenate.
All the forms 
of Geum found in Ireland are identical with those of the western parts of 
Spain and Portugal.
Among the forms exhibited was a very fine species 
of Geum, found in the Great Blasket Island, coast of Kerry, at the 
extreme western point of that island, exposed to the western gales and 
sprays of the Atlantic.
The drawing of the plant was taken from a spe- 
cimen in full flower by the late George V.
Du Noyer.
This beautiful 
saxifrage is remarkable in having a series of glands of a rich rose colour, 
surrounding the base of the ovary, which gives a remarkal)lc appearance 
to its iuHorescence.
Mr. A.
G. More has noticed at the entrance of Dingle 
Harbour, exposetl to the spray of the sea, remarkably large and strong 
forms of Gtmn.
The author continued : — " Another form [^S*.
Andrewsli\ 
I wish to exhibit, in order that botanists in their excursions in this coun- 
try may recognize it by its form of leaves.
It has already been described 
by the late Dr. Harvey, and although so distinct from other forms of 
vmhrosa in the foliage, yet in that variable group no specific sepai-ation 
could be formed on such characters.
It is in the floral organs that the 
distinction is maintainable, and these are so remarkable that it would 
puzzle botanists to assert with certainty how hybridization could have 
produced characters of the ovary, which cause its affinity to plants whose 
periods of flowering and perfecting their seeds are at an early and late 
period of the season.
This, as Mr. C.
Watson expresses in the ' Cybele 
Britannica,' is a botanical puzzle, and one that renders it very dithcull to 
withdraw from its botanical distinctness.
I have lately given Mr. A.
G. 
More the exact locality of this rare form, and fully expect that in the 
course of this summer he will be able to verify this as he has done other 
of my discoveries.
I may refer to some remarkable specimens oS.

growth, and, what is remarkable, many produce in the axils of the bracts 
foliaceous buds.
These characteristics ally it with S.
hncanthemifolia of 
the Pyrenees, and decidedly to S.foliolosa of Robert Brown, described in 
Torrey and Gray's American Flora.
On reCernniJ^ to notices already 
given of these forms of saxifrages, I was not surprised to find in the 
eleventh volume of the 'Annals of Natural History,' in an article by 
John Ball, Esq., a well-known European botanist, that he bad gathered 
in the Otzal in the Tyrol the plant described as S.
leucanthenufolia, 
Lapeyr., by Reichenbach and other German botanists, and is quite of the 
opinion of Bertoloni, that it is only a state of S.
dellar'is.
Mr. Ball gives 
its characteristics, showing how near to or identical it is with some of the 
forms of S.
dellans.
He mentions a variety of S.
slellaris found by him 
in Curslieve, in Mayo, which is much more different from the ordinary 
form.
It is larger, hairy, and somewhat viscose, the panicle widely 
spreading, the bracts foliaceous.
He considers this to be the same as 
-S".
Clmii, variety a.
of De CandoUe's ' Prodromus.' Similar forms have 
been found by me in Kerry.
The late Professor Kinahan mentioned to 
me that he had noticed in Mayo tiie singular form »S'.
Andrewsii." These 
notes are merely intended as reference to the plants exhibited, not to any 
definite descriptions of their botanical characteristics.
Notice had been given at the General Meeting, held on the 5th of 
April last, " That it would be submitted to the members the necessity of 
the removal of the museum collections of the Society from Mr. Williams's 
rooms.
Dame Sti'cet, and to adopt means for their further disposal." 
The following resolutions were proposed and seconded, and passed 
unanimously: — "That the following gentlemen be nominated to form a 
Committee for the purpose of reporting the best means for the disposal of 
the museum collections, viz.
Professor Haughton, P.
U.S.

Montgomery, Esq., and Artliur An- 
drews, Esq. That Mr. Montgomery be appointed to act as Secretary to 
the Comunttee.
That the library of the Society be deposited in charge 
of the Treasurer, Mr. Arthur Andrews." 
The members of the Morocco Exploring Expedition returned to Eng- 
land in safety.
Dr. Hooker arrived on Wednesday, the 20tli June, by a 
private vessel, leaving the collector behind at Gibraltar to pack up the 
specimens, and follow by the regular steamer.
The collections, both 
living and dried, have reached Kew in good condition, and their deter- 
mination will soon be commenced ; but of course, from the size and intri- 
cacy of the numerous large genera of the Mediterranean flora, this will 
be a work of considerable time and labour.
The living plants consist 
principally of bulbs, Orchids, and Crassulaceae, and the species which/are 
suitable for general cultivation will, as they reach the proper condition, 
be figured in the ' Botanical IMagazine.' The dried collection is estimated 
to contain at least 1000 species.

under the name of Symea.
It is a plant from Chili, with the general 
habit of Gagea, but with green tlowers with segments united in a short 
cup at the base, with only three small stamens from the throat of the cup, 
alternating with three minute membranous staminodia.

SILER TRILOBUM AS A BRITISH PLANT.
By Henky Trimen, M.B., F.L.S.
(Plate CXVIII.) 
At p.
211 of the present volume, Mr. J.
C. Melvill has placed on re- 
cnnl his discovery of tliis U-iiibellifer in Cambrido-eshire, first in May-June, 
18(J7, and ao-ain found in May, 1871.
It is at his request that' I have 
written the following notes.
^ On July 10th last I had the pleasure of being guided by Professor 
C. C.
Babington, of Cambridge, to the spot, and seeing the plant in sltn.
1 he locality is well described by Mr. Melvill, and the Siler grows amid 
the indigenous vegetation of the district ; and though adjoining a very 
well-known spot, the " chalkpit close," at Cherry-Hinton, frequently men- 
tioned by Kay, Martyn, and Relhan, it is a retired place, and one some- 
wiiat difficult of access.
This may account for the species having been 
overlooked, for whether originally introduced or not, it must surelv, to 
judge from the appearance of the plants, have existed in this spot 'for 
many years.
It has been suggested that though noticed here, it had been 
confounded with Smyrnimn Olmatnun, which grows within a few yards 
of it in the busliy hedge of the chalkpit close ; such a confusion seems 
only likely when the plants are quite young.
The number of individuals 
does not now prol)ably exceed a dozen", but Mr. Melvill tells me that when 
he first noticed the plant, four years ago, the nundjer was considerablv 
larger, from fifty to sixty plants, cidtivation having since invaded its thrii 
limits.
Unless the presence of Snnjrniinn OUmtnim is so considered 
and this grew here so far back as 16(10 (Ray, Cat. Cant.
p. 76)— there is 
nothing in the surrounding conditions of' SUer to indicate an artificial 
origin, and I should have had little hesitation in admitting it into 
the native flora, were it not that Professor Babington informs me that 
Mr. Biggs, curator some thirty-five years back of the University botanic 
garden, is known to have been in the habit of sowing seeds in the neigh- 
bourhood.
There is no evidence, so far as I know, tending to show that 
Sder, or any other plant now found about Cambridge, is the result of Mr.
Biggs's seed-sowings, still the statement is one which it is necessarv to 
take into consideration in attempting to determine the question as regards 
Siler; further data will be afforded by the exotic distribution oT the 
species.
By the early botanists Siler was a name applied to several umbelliferous 
plants.
The Siler moiitauutn of Tragus, Lobel, Clusius, and others, is the 
species now called Lfiserpitinin Siler, L.
With reference to the plant of 
which I am writing, though it seems to have been known by report to C.
Bauhin, it was not clearly distinguished till 10/2, when Morison (Uin- 
bellif.
p. 8) well described it under the appropriate name of Siler Jquilegifs 
fuliis, his figure, however (Hist.
Oxon.
iii.

9. t.

As is somewhat frequently the case with plants which he had not seen, we 
find rather the reverse of progress in the knowledge of this species made 
by Limutus, who either quite missed the plant, or confused it thoroughly

witli one or more species of Lrtserpitlnrn, iiiidcr tlio name of L.
Irilohnm, 
frum which "enus, as defined by Linnaeus, its fruit-cliaracters entirely 
exclude it.
This is well pointed out by Crantz (Stirp.
Austriac.
f. 3.
p. 
186), who places our plant iu his genus Siler, in which, nevertheless, he 
unaccountably also includes Linnseus's Laserpitium Siler and L.
gcilUcum.
Though Crantz then is the founder of Siler as a genus in the post-Linnfean 
sense, the definition of Scopoli in the second edition of his ' Flora 
Carniolica' (vol.
i. p.
217), who restricted it to the present species, is 
that generally quoted.
Bentham and Hooker give (Gen. Plant.
908) 
Scopoli as the authority for the genus, with which they incorporate 
HoiTraann's JyaaylUs. The technical characters of the fruit readily dis- 
tinguish it.
Siler, Scop.
— *Fruit glabrous, oval-oblong, slightly dorsally com- 
pressed ; commissure wide, flat cr sliglitly concave; carpels nearly semi- 
circular on transverse section, each with 9 blunt prominent ribs, none of 
them winged, the 5 primary ribs rather thicker and more prominent than 
the 4 secondary ones, the 2 marginal ones especially prominent, forming 
with the adjacent ones of the other carpel a blunt double rim to the fruit ; 
vittee solitary, buried one in each secondary rib, and not visible on the 
surface of the fruit, two other vittee in the face of the commissure; seed 
lenticular-coni|)ressed, fiat or nearly so on the face ; stylopod small, rather 
flat; styles persistent, closely reflexed over the stylopod.
(When dry the 
dorsal compression of the carpels becomes much greater, and the ribs so 
much narrower and more prominent, as to have led to their being described 
as winged.)

fraotod below tlie slylopod, crowned with the persistent veflexed styles 
(foi' full description of the fruit, see g-eneric characters).
The rigiti, perfectly solid stem and branches are remarkable, though not 
]XTidiar to S'Uer, amongst Umbel lifers, when young they are covered with 
a very glaucous " bloom" ; the leaves are very characteristic, much like 
those of Columbine, but thicker ; as the plant gets old they gain, as well 
as the rest of the plant, a purplisli tinge.
At the point of origin of the 
radii of the primary umbel, the summit of the branch is dilated, and after 
the flowering period, forms a hemispherical head, the radii being then 
separated by intervening i)ortions.
The largest umbels from Cambridge 
measure more than 13 inches in diameter; in all the specimens the only 
fertile ones are those at the end of the main branches (and in these the 
central flowers are barren) ; those of the axillary branches — which over- 
top the terminal umbels, and in direction continue the axes — are always 
barren.
The taste of the fruit is aromatic and bitter, not unlike that of 
Smyruiiim.

Lorraine (Billot, no.

It is also recorded from Provence, Bavaria, 
Hungary, Croatia, Transylvania, Slavonia, Central European Russia and 
the Caucasian provinces.
De Candolle (I.e.) gives the Pyrenees, but he 
perhaps here mistook LnHerpitinm, Nestim, !Soyer-\N ill., for this species.
Morison states that lie received it from Monte Gargano in Apulia.

It seems, 
then, that Si/er is a plant of decided eastern proclivities, its head-quar- 
ters being in Styria and adjacent districts of the Austrian Empire.
The 
nearest points on the Continent to the Cambridge locality are the neigh- 
bourhood of Metz in Lorraine and the south-western portion of Hanover 
(Iliidesheim, Bodenwerder, etc.).
Bushy places on chalk and limestone, 
are the localities it affects, and it would appear to be in most j)laces a 
local and sporadic species.
If the Candmdgeshire station is a native one, 
it must be regarded as an isolated outlying post ; points in its favour arc, 
the quite similar character of the spot to those in which tiie plant is found 
abroad, and the exceptional climatologieal and geographical conditions of 
the district of England in which it is situated, shown by its remarkable 
flora, including two other Umbellileras all but restricted to it in England.
As to the systematic position of the genus, Silei' is not very closely 
allied to any British TJ)iiheU'iJ'erre.
Bentham ami Hooker, indeed, in Gen.
Plantarum, place it with ^iihum, (Eiiaiithe, and Silans in the tribe CEnon- 
i}ie(P, but the presence of both secondary and primary ribs separates it 
both from these and call British genera, except the prickly-fruited ones, 
Danciis, Caxcalii, and Torilis.
If to be included in British floras, it will 
be necessary to emplov for its reception a separate tribe or snbtribe (^Sile-

The confusion has arisen in the absence of ripe

ON THE T)ISPERSIOx\ OP MONT.\NE PLANTS OVER THE 
HILLS OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.
By J.
G. Baker, P.L.S.
We have in the North of England four separate tracts of hilly country, 
in each of which, over a considerable extent of surface, a particular kind 
of rock, or more than one kind combined, are accumulated in masses so 
that each area presents distinctly marked orographic and lithological cha- 
racteristics.
The l)otany of each of these four ranges has now been very 
thoroughly explored, so that I believe we may safely take for granted that 
very little still remains to be done in ascertaining which of the Montane 
species grow in each of the four areas, and which are absent.
I pro|)ose, 
therefore, in the present paper to go through the list of Montane planls, 
and examine how they are distributed through the four masses, not quoting 
special stations in detail, as these are mostly in print already, but simply 
noting in brief general terms the rarity or commonness of the plant in 
each particular tract, and indicating which of the species of the two Boreal- 
montane types have made themselves at home in some of the ranges, but 
are absent from others ; so as to bring together in one view a compendious 
summary of the facts of the sui)ject.
The fouy ranges of hill may be named and characterized as follows, 
viz.
: — 
OVER THE HILLS OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.
261 
1. The Porphjnlic Hills.
— The Cheviot mass, composed tiitircly of 
iti-iieous rocks of a porphyritic character, situated partly in tlie north-west 
of Northuinbeiland, and partly in Roxburghshire.
Like all the others, 
this has its base in Mr. Watson's Alidagrarian zone.
There may be a 
square mile of area that rises into his Arctic zone, the two highest peaks 
reaching- 2348 and 2676 feet, but the upper part of these peaks is very 
bare and monotonous, and almost destitute of damp precipice ; and I 
know of only seven Montane species that grow there above 650 yards.
1 am leaving out of account entirely in this paper that portion of the 
Cheviot mass that falls within Scotland, which I have not had the oppor- 
tunity of exploring personally.
That portion which falls within Northum- 
berland is about 2(J0 square miles in area, and is drained by branches of 
the Tweed and Coquet.
2. The Carboniferous Hilk.
— The area which I am including here under 
this head is that portion of the Pennine chain that falls between the Tyne 
and the Wharf.
It embraces an area of at least a thousand square miles, 
belongs entirely to the eastern slope of the Pennine ridge, and fills up the 
whole of the western part of North Yorkshire, Durham, and the southern 
part of Northuudjerland.
The following streams run through it from 
west to east : — the Wear, Tees, Swale, and Yore ; and the hills between 
them rise very gradually as we ascend the streams, culminating in several 
isolated peaks and ridges that reach into the luferarctic, but none into the 
Midarctic zone.
The rocks consist of several important bands of homo- 
geneous encrinitic limestone, with thick masses of intervening and super- 
posed clays and sandstone, and in Teesdale a considerable mass of basalt 
is interposed amongst the sedimentary strata.
3. The Slate Hills of the Westmoreland and Cumberland Lake district 
occupy an area of about 400 square miles.
The main lakes which are in- 
terspersed amongst them are all decidedly within 100 yards of the sea 
level.
The following peaks exceed 900 yards: — Scawfell Pikes (which 
reaches 3208 feet), Scawfell, Helvellyn, Faiitield, Skiddaw, Bowfell, Great 
Gable, Saddleback, Grassmoor, St. Sunday Crag, and High Street.
These 
spread over an area of not less than 20 miles from east to west, and of 
10 miles from north to south, and of most of them some at least of the 
sides are abrupt and precipitous.
We may fairly regard all these peaks 
that have been mentioned as rising into the Midarctic zone ; so that in 
this point, and also in its much greater rainfall, as well as in its litholo- 
gical constitution, this group differs from all the other three.
4. The Oolitic Hills of North-East Yorkshire, which, with the Lias 
upon which they rest, occupy an area of 850 square miles.
The Middle 
Oolite, which, running from east to west, tills up the southern third of 
this area, is almost entirely calcareous in lithological constitution.
The 
Lower Oolite and Lias of the lower levels and northern two-thirds of the 
area are arenaceous and aluminaceous.
Numerous streams, running prin- 
cipally north and south, break up the mass, the general character of which 
is that of an elevated table-land, into dales and glens.
None of the 
higher peaks and ridges exceed 1500 feet, so that this mass is decidedly 
lower than the three others, and does not anywhere attain even the lufer- 
arctic zone.
1 am not taking into account at all the low hills of the centre of 
Norlluunberland, or of the western slope of tlic Pennine chain through 
(!uud)rrl;Mid and Wesfinorelaml, or its exten-rion through the West itidnig

In looking over the lists, the following comments of a general character 
suggest themselves : — ' 
1. With regard to the Porphyritic tract, the paucity of Montane plants, 
as counted both by species and individuals, is remarkable when we con- 
sider the area that it occupies ami the height to which it reaches, and that 
it is considerably more northern in position than the other three ranges.

OVER THE HILLS OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.
269 
Its species, it will be noticed, belong, with very slight exception, to botli 
the Carboniferous and Sbite ranges.
Tlie montane botany of the Por- 
pliyry is just tluit of the two moi'e southern ranges, with a large deduc- 
tion.
2. Remembering the lower altitude reached by the Oolitic range, its 
drier rocks and lower rainfall, it might naturally be expected to yield 
much fewer Montane plants than the other three masses, and this expec- 
tation is fulfilled.
The most striking instances of plants frequent in the 
three other ranges and absent here, are furnished by Rnbns C^Kinicemoras, 
Epilobinin ah'nii folium, Sediun villosiim, Saxifraga stellaris and JnjpiioiJes, 
Hleracinm pallidum, and Curex rujida.
3. Of the twenty-four species that occur in the Slate mass, but 
are absent from the Carboniferous range, eiglit only may fairly be 
called frequent.
These -eight are SiU'ne acanlis, Alchemilla olpina, 
Circcea alpina, Sednm Rhodiola, Lobelia Dortmanna, Oxi/ria reniforiiiis, 
Salix herbdcea, and Isoetes lacustris.
Of these twenty-four species, 
three, — Sabularia aquatica.
Lobelia Dortmanna, and Isoetes lacustris, — 
one rare, two common, grow submerged in the lakes ; one species only, 
Salix herbacea, belongs distinctly to the hill-peaks, which in this 
mass, out of the four only, reach the mid-arctic zone ; and ten species, 
— Arabis petrrsa, Lychnis alpina, Cerastiuni alpirmm, Saxifraga nivalis, 
S. oppositifoUa, Hieraciitm alpinum, H.
pulmonarinm, Sauss/irea alpina, 
Luznla spicata, and Poa alpina, — are rare plants of the precipices of the 
Inferarctic zone, of which there are very few in the Carboniferous tract.
Tiie 
vertical and horizontal ubiquity of Allosorus crispus in the Slate tract is 
also a positive characteristic that should be taken into account, as one of 
its prominent botanico-geographical features ; and the ubiquity of Salix 
herbacea on its peaks of the Mid-arctic zone.
4. Although for the restriction of most of the twenty-four species to 
the Slate mass, which grow there but not in the Carboniferous tract, it is 
not difficult to find a plausible reason, it is not the same for the presence 
of the twenty-four species in the Carboniferous tract which are absent 
from the Slate, the names of which a glance at the table just given will 
show.
For four of them, — Draba incana, Dryas octopetala, Orobanche 
rubra, and Sesleria crendea, — we may, no doubt, safely account on the 
score of a distinct preference for the limestone.
But still twenty species 
remain, for the occurrence of which here, and not in the Slate hills, I 
cannot venture to allege any cause ; and the occurrence of these twenty 
species under such conditions seems one of the most curious problems 
which the geographical botany of the centre of the island offers for our 
solution.
Of these twenty species, ten are restricted to Teesdale.
Alt the 
twenty are mainly or entirely plants of the .Agrarian region, confined to, 
or with their head-quarters in, the Superagrarian zone.
In addition to 
the presence of these species here which are absent from the Slate, the 
following, which are rare or very rare in the latter, are much more 
abundant in the eastern mass, viz.
Thlaspi alpestre, Fiola Intea, Arenaria 
verna, Potentilla frnticosa, Rnbns Chamw morns, Sedum, villosnm, .ispleninni 
viride, and Eqnisetnni varieyatnm.
I shoidd not omit, also, to mention 
the abundance of Gentiana verna in Teesdale, in contrast with its absence 
from the Slate in this connection, although standing as an " Intermediate" 
in the ' Cybcle,' it has not been included in my catalogue.
The ubiquity 
of Rnbns C.'hamamorns on the Inferarctic Carboniferous peaks is also a 
salient character of contract.
270 SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
5. Note, in conclusion, that there nre only twenty-three species fonnd 
in all tlie four masses, and that six of these are very rare in the Oolite, 
leaving- only seventeen montane plants which may be considered as dis- 
persed up to a standard of moderate frequency through the four ranges.
SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
Bromus asper, L., Beneken.
— I am very glad to have been able lo 
s°.e this in the living state.
An examination of the plant noticed by 
Mr. Warren in Kensington Gardens (see p.
238) shows all the characters 
pointed out by Beneken in his paper (Bot. Zeitung, 1845, 725), as dis- 
tinguishing it from his i?.
serotinus, which is the usual English ' ^ asper" 
— or rather, if we are to use the oldest name, B.
ramosits, lluds., as I have 
shown in Journ.
Bot. VIII.
376.
The aspect of the Kensington Gardens 
plant when growing is more distinct than the characters would have led 
one to expect ; the slender nodding panicle and small hoary spikelets 
scarcely at tirst suggest B.
ramosus {futper) at all.
There are always more 
than two branches in the lowest semi-verticil of the panicle, and these 
are shorter than in the ordinary plant, and not divaricate at a right angle 
with the main axis, but ascending, forming an acute angle with it ; tiie 
upper part of the panicle is drawn out and very pendulous, with several 
short-stalked single spikelets arranged on it.
The spikelets themselves 
are not more than an inch long, containing from 5 to 8 Howcrs.
The 
glumes are much less unequal than in the usual plant.
Good characters 
are presented by the upper glume, which has its lateral ribs strongly 
hairy, and by the lower pales, which are uniformly hairy (to which the 
grey appearance of the spikelet is due), and not longer than their awns.
The anthers are orange.
The leaves, especially the lower ones, are con- 
siderably more hairy, and somewhat narrower than in usual B.
raniosiis, 
Huds , whilst the sheath of the uppermost leaf is almost glabioiis.
Though some of these characters are occasionally found in the common 
plant, the coexistence of all is sufficiently characteristic.
Besides these 
points, the plant certainly flowers earlier than its commoner ally, the 
Kensington Gardens specimens, which grow in damp shady ground, were 
past flowering on August 4th (and the process of drying has since broken 
up the spikelets into separate flowers), whilst B.
serotinus, of which I 
saw plenty on the next day in the sunny hedgerows of Hillingdon, was 
just in flower.
The plant would be worth cultivation, with a view of 
testing the permanency of these characters.
As for the locality, it seems 
most likely that the grass has been introduced into ihe Gardens, perhaps 
from abroad : Apera Spica-venti grows in the same enclosure.
However 
that may be, it is one of the n)Ost interesting plants in Mr. Warren's 
remarkable list, to which, by the way, I can add Impatiens parcijlora and 
Bromus sterilis, the former in Hyde Park, the latter in Kensington 
Gardens.

Spffolk Plants.
— I gathered several rare and interesting plants last 
month in the neighbourhood of Mildenhall and C'avenham, and there are 
two of them to which I wish now specially to call attention.
The one is 
a ciliated form of PoJjjijala depressa, which I gathered on a grassy bank

by tlie side of bog-oy grouiid near Lachford Bridge.
There was plenty of 
the ordinary F.
depressa.
on the peaty ground below ; but every plant 
wliich I examined from tlie bank, which was of a sandy soil, had the outer 
sepals strongly ciliated.
Mr. Watson, on p.
488 of his Comp.
of Cyb.
Br., mentions the probability of its occurring, but I have not heard for 
certain if it has been noticed before.
The other plant is the Alsine laxa, 
Jord.
(variety of Ahlue tenidfoUa), I found it abundautly in the neigh- 
bourhood of Icklingham, Mildenhall, and Herringswell.
It differs chiefly 
from A.
tniuifolia proper, by the longer capsule, aud also by having a 
few glandular hairs on the calyx.

— I gathered a few specimeus of this plant on a single spot 
near Highbeech, Essex, on the 2n(l of August.
Its characters clearly 
correspond with the description given in E.
B. under var.
y, viz.
stamens 
6 ; filaments twice as long as the anthers; capsule impressed at the apex.
I have carefully searched other parts of Epping Forest, but I have not 
as yet succeeded in finding another locality for it.
Considering, however, 
what a very variable plant /.
sujuuus is, this variety has probably been 
often overlooked.

Middlesex Plants.
— A speciuien of Barbaj-ea sfricta, Fr., commu- 
nicated to me by Mr. Baker, enables me to identify with it a plant in my 
herbarium., collected at Chase Bridge, between Twickenham and Houns- 
low.
The large terminal and almost evanescent lateral segments of the 
leaves are a striking character.
Dr. Boswcll Syme appears to be in error 
in describing the colour of the flowers as paler than ni B.
vitlgaris.
Mr. Baker correctly describes it as orange-yellow and deeper.
The loca- 
lities given in the 'Flora of Middlesex' for Lctthijms Nmolut, L., are 
almost all somewhat antiquated ; Mr. A.
W. Bennett, however, informs 
me that he has seen lately numerous specimens froui the neighbourhood 
of Mill Hill.— W.

There is in the Kew herbarium a specimen of Henilarla glabra, L., 
from Dr. Burchell's herbarium, to which the following label is attached: — 
" Herriinrin glabra, Fl. B.
Ex horto proprio, eveuit ex humo ab Ealing 
Common, 21.6.17." — James Britten.
I found the plant I now seiul — Bupleurum rotnndlfolinm — in the

Tr'ujondla ornithnpoflioitJes, De Cand.
— I found this species, ten or 
twelve plants, by the wayside near the thirteenth milestone on the Uxbridge 
road ; nearly opposite Hillingdon Place Lodge, in Middlesex.
I see by 
the 'Flora of Middlesex' (p.

tainly extinct." — J.

My friend, Mr. W.
A. Tooke, of Pinner Hill, has been diligently study- 
ing tlie botany of the districts between Pinner and the Colne.
I have had 
the pleasure of accompanying him in several of his walks ; the result has 
been the addition of several plants to the flora of the district.
It is de- 
sirable that a record should be kept of these discoveries, and I therefore 
send you the following list of some of the plants noticed by us since the 
publication of the ' Plora of Middlesex.' I append the initials of the 
observer to each plant.

H. — The plant noted in ' F'lora 
of Middlesex ' (p.
273) as Epipactis paluatris, Sw., was found again 
in Pinner Wood last year, 187U, but I had not an o|)portuniiy of 
seeing it.
Two plants have been found this year in Nanscot Wood, 
about thirty yards beyond the Middlesex boundary, which are probably 
E. purparata, Sm. I should have certainly marked them so, were it 
not that the fully-blown flowers are patent and not connivent, and the 
upper bracts are shorter than the flowers.
The lip is very faintly 
crenate, but not sufficiently so nor sufficiently large to assure me that it is 
E. palustris.
The germens of the flovvers are ghmdular, not flowny.
A 
plant with very large roundish leaves, nearly obovato-spathulate, has been 
found in Pinner Wood by ]\Ir. W.
A. Tooke (not in Howcr), which I think 
will prove to be Epipactis lutifolia.
All. Should it reappear next year, we 
may settle this point.
An Epipactis, either latifoUa or wedia, has been 
found in copse at Headstone, Pinner, by Mr. Bourne.

in size and brilliancy of colour.
Amongst the rarer species found I may 
name Hydnotri.a Tidas^iei, B.

Wood, and which was kindly determined for me by C.
E. Broome, Esq.
It measured 3^ inches in circuniferenc e, but was not mature.

the same spot some time later in the month (.July), I was unsuccessful 
in finding another specimen.
I also found Slrobiloviyces strofnlacens,

This is a very remarkable 
Fungus, from its resemblance to the cone of the Scotch Fir, and the 
peculiar red tinge which the flesh assumes when it is cut or bruised.
It 
is well figured on a reduced scale in Mr. Cooke's excellent ' Handbook of 
British Fungi.' In the same wood occurred several specimens of Hydiuim

ABSTiUCT OF RESEARCHES ON THE ANATOMY OF 
BUD-SCALES.
By F.
W. C.
Areschoug.
{Translated by W.
T. Thiselton Dyer, B.A., B.Sc.) 
In a paper on the structure of the leaf {^Acta JJnlvcrsUatls Lmidensis, 
1867) 1 have endeavoured to show that the leaf is a flattened stein.* 
The limb cousists principally of cortex, of which the external tissue, mo- 
dified, in the case of leaves exposed to air, iuto a parenchyma composed 
of cells resembling the stakes of a pidisa(le,t is developed more espe- 
cially on the upper side of the leaf, while the inner layer of the cortex, 
converted into a spongy parenchyma, forms its luwer region.
In the 
bud-scales the celluhu' tissues of the stem appear almost unchanged, and 
the difference of structure between the outer and inner sides of the scale 
is not so considerable as that which exists in leaves exposed to tiie air.
The cortical tissues forming the greater part of the bud-scale resend^le 
those of the stem, the outer layer being found, in the bud-scale, on both 
sides, and entirely enclosing the inner layer.
The external layer, how- 
ever, is more marked on the external side of the scale, probably because 
it appears there as a protective tissue ; while this layer, modified in true 
leaves iuto palisade-parenchyma, occurs wiiolly, or at any rale for the 
* Casimir De Candolle has developed a theory in some respects analogous to 
this.
According to his view, founded on the half- circular arrangement of the 
fibro-vascular bundles as seen in a cross-section, the leaf is a branch with its 
posterior half atrophied.

most part, on the upper side, corresponding to the inner in tlie bud- 
scale.
A peculiarity, which has nothint^ corresponding to it in leaves properly 
so called, is the anatomical ditierence which exists most frequently 
between the inferior and protected part of the bud-scales and their upper 
and naked portion.
The external scales being wholly naked, it is only 
at their lowest portion, where they are attached to the stem of the bud, 
that they present any difference from the upper portion ; in all the other 
scales this distinction exhibits itself throughout the whole p7-otec(ed portion.
Speaking generally, the cellular tissues of these portions resemble those 
which compose tiie stem in its earliest state in the bud; they are more 
tender, and have their walls thinner than in the upper portion.
Even when 
the internal structure of the bud-scales is only composed of a kind of 
liber, with vascular bundles, as in the Beech, this holds true, at least as 
to the delicacy and thinness of the cell-walls.
In other respects, the 
differences may involve either the colour of the cell walls, and even the cell 
contents, or the structure of the cellular tissues.
In these two cases the 
modifications go on augmenting from the base of the bud-scale to the 
apex, and they are more manifest on the outer side than on the inner.
The difference of colour depends ordinarily on the changes which the cell 
contents undergo : the lower part of the scale contains cells with colour- 
less cell walls, and cell conteiits fre(|ueiitly containing chlorophyll, but 
often colourless and muddy-looking ; but in the upper part these are 
transformed into a sap often brilliantly coloured (Tilia, Salix), or into a 
brown and resinous substance, which infiltrates and tinges the cell-walls 
either of the epidermis alone or of the rest of the cellular tissue as well 
{^Rhamnus alj/iud, L.).
In so far as the difference between the upper and lower part of the 
scales depends on the cellular tissues, the former may consist of cork or 
bast fibres, while the latter resembles more the stem within the bud.
However, the different structure of the bud-scales at different heights 
does not always correspond to the cellular tissues of the stem and that of 
the lower part of the scale; frequently the cellular tissue of this,.
as, for 
example, in many conifers, consists of a layer of cork (^Abies excelsa, 
De Cand.), or is even transformed, for the most part, into a viscous 
matter {Ulmus inoitana, Sm ).
On the other hand, there are bud-scales 
{Msculiis, Fraxinns) where there is no noticeable difference betv een the 
two portions, and this is especially the case with those in which the 
cellular tissue contains chlorophyll, and the function of warmlh-retaining 
seems to belong to the epidermis.
The variety in the iiuier structure of the bud-scales depends upon the 
fact that it is sometimes one, and sometimes another, of the cellular 
tissues of the stem which forms the principal portion.
It is only the tissues, however, existing outside the cambium of the 
stem which contribute, in a considerable extent, to the formation of buil- 
scales ; the cambium and the vascular bundles, although they are never 
wholly deficient, are always little developed.
In fixing our attention on 
the exterior bud-scales, and on the upper and naked portions of' the 
iimer bud-scales, we shall find that their principal portion may consist of 
the following cellular tissues : — 
1. Bud.
— It is only the bud-sealcs of Fagus si/Ivalica, L., that consist 
wholly of bast ; in other cases bast bundles arc found, in addition to

2. I)iti^rior cortical layer.
— The two layers of cortex are easily dis- 
tinouishable ; the inner may sometimes form the predominant layer in 
the bud-scales, as in Rhannius alpina, L., Tilia parvifuUa, Ehrh.
In 
this last tree this tissue is especinlly remarkable for the presence of large 
cavities filled with a viscous matter.* In Popnlns dilatata.

one from the other, it is the inner layer, which in the bud-scales predo- 
minates over the outer one.
3. Older cortical layer.
— This cellular tissue predominates in the bud- 
scales of Acer plata)ioides, L., and the different species of Sdix, — 
S. lanata, L., for example.
When no difference exists between the two 
layers of the cortex, as in JEscultis Ilippocastannm, L., and Fraxiuuii 
excelsior, L., the entire parenchyma of the bud-scales seems to correspond 
to the external cortical layer.
4. Cork.
— The whole of the upper and naked portion of the biul-scalea 
of Ulmus rnontana, Sm., consists, for the most part, of this tissue ; in 
their lower portion the cortex is the predominant element, and its inner 
tissue decomposes, in great measure, into a viscous fluid.
Corylm Avel- 
lana, L., resembles the Elm in the consistence of its bud-scales.
5. Epidermis.
— The middle scales of Jbies excelso, De Cand., as well 
as of other conifers, consist for the most part of an epidermis, of which 
the external wall is considerably thickened.
[It may be useful to give the morphological equivalents of some of the 
bud-scales, of which the minute anatomy has been described by Areschoug.

Dicfyoxylony This genus — establislied by the author on stems exhibit- 
ing structure from the coal-measures — was described as consisting of a 
central vascular axis, with radiating vascular phites, separated by medullary 
rays, and surrounded by a pareuciiymatous layer containiug free vascular 
bundles like those of the centre, and the whole enclosed in a bark com- 
posed of elongated cells, some of which were thickened by secondary de- 
posits, and arranged in somewhat regular lozenge-shaped meshes, giving 
to the exterior of the stem a Lepidodendroid aspect.
Five species were 
described.
Mr. Carruthers criticized the descriptions of the author, and 
maintained that the stems, though exhibiting certain unimportant varia- 
tions, could be correlated with the stems of some existing Lycopodiacete.
W. Carruthers, '' On the Vegetable contents of IMasses of Limestone 
occurring in Trappean Rocks in Fifeshire, and the conditions under which 
they were preserved." Tiie fragments of limestone had been observed on 
the shore and traced to their place in the rocks by Mr. Grieve.
They oc- 
curred, of different sizes, in a coarse amygdaloidal trap-rock, and the 
author believed that they were fragments of a peaty layer forming on the 
surface of the land at the time the volcanic matter was thrown up, and that 
this layer was broken up, and its fragments, along with masses of clay, 
sandstone, etc., were enclosed in the volcanic materials when they were 
arranged under water.
The large amount of lime contained in the trap 
seized on the peat and converted it into limestone before it had time to 
decay.
The plants were those peculiar to the Carboniferous period.
Professor Williamson believed that the liuicstoue was formed where it was 
found, and occurred in distinct layers between igneous rocks.
The great 
difference in the hardness of the substance was due to the intluence of the 
burning rock.
Mr. Pengelly, in his Re])ort on Kent's Cavern, stated 
that he had obtained impressions of Ftrns in the stalagmite of the Cave,

Thomas 
Brown, F.ll.S.E., " On Fossil Wood from the Base of the Lower Carboni-

the lower carboniferous rocks of this locality some specimens of fossil 
wood which seemed to possess certain peculiarities of structure deserving 
of notice.
The transverse section showed a central pith with numerous 
rays going off" towards the circunderence, and the appearance of annual 
rings of growth.
The longitudinal section showed it to consist of scala- 
ril'orm tissue, and what appeared to be rays were found to be vascular 
bundles.
The author stated at some length the reasons which led him 
to think that the dark circles were really analogous to the annual rings of 
living exogenous trees.
He referred also to the combination of crypto- 
gamic characters with those of exogenous structure.
Mr. Carruthers 
considered that this belonged to a Lepidodendroid ]daid, which had 
been described by Colta as Diploxyluii.
The appearance of annual 
rings he cousidi'red deceptive, being due to alterations in the speci- 
mens during fossilization.

but not always as easily to be expressed in words.

such a general habit iu leguminous and composite plants is familiar 
to every one.
What have been hitherto spoken of as jnimetic plants 
are simply cnses where a plant belonging to one family puts on the 
habit characteristic of another.
This is entirely different from mimicry 
among animals, inasmuch as the resembling plants are hardly ever found 
with those they resemble, but more usually in widely different regions.
Mutisia speciosa, from Western South America, a Composite, has a scan- 
dent leguminous habit, and closely agrees in its foliage with Lntliyras 
marltimiis of the European shores (although that plant is not strictly 
speaking scandrnt).
In the same way three different genera of Ferns have 
species (found in distant parts of the world) indistinguishable in a barren 
state.
The term Mimicry seems objectionable in these cases, and I pro- 
pose Pseudomoi'i^hism as a substitute.
As to the cause of the pheno- 
menon, I can only suggest that the influence of similar external circum- 
stances moulds plants into the similar form most advantageous to them.
An illustration is aft'orded by the closely resembling bud scales which are 
found in widely separated Natural Orders of deciduous ti'ces as modifica- 
tions of stipules.
I do not, however, think that the moulding influence 
need always be the same.
I believe that diflerent external conditions 
may produce the same result ; in this respect they may be called analogous.
For example, several identical plants are found on the seashore, and also 
on mountains.
The reason is, I believe, that they are equally able to tole- 
rate the effect of soda salts and also of mountain climate; the tolerance of 
either unfavourable condition gives them the advantaii,e over less elastici- 
cally constituted plants, and the two are therefore analogous in their effect, 
Professor Dickson remarked that instances of so-called mimicry were 
by no means uncommon amongst plants.
Comparing Eitphorbiacere with 
CactncerB and Stapdia, it was often practically impossible to distinguisii 
them without seeing their flowers.
In these cases similar physical condi- 
tions appear to have produced the similarity.
Mr. Carruthers said that 
though not wholly agreeing with the views of Professor Thiselton Dyer, 
some facts occurred to his mind which rather sustained those views.
The 
vegetation which bordered fresh- water streams throughout the world all 
conformed, more or less, in certain characteristics of foliage to the willow 
type ; this was true even of Australian Myrtaceous plants.
With regard 
to Mutisia, he might say that he believed that from tiie suborder of 
which it was the type alone, the habit of alnr.ost all the principal Orders of 
flowering plants might be represented.
He fully bore out the statements 
as to Ferns, and he pointed out that the wliole subject constituted one of 
the special difficulties of fossil botany.
Professor Balfour could confirm 
the remarks of the last speaker as to the important bearing of this sub- 
ject upon fossil botany.
The speculations as to the effect of maritime 
conditions upon plants were particularly interesting.
It was by no means 
easy to give a satisfactory explanation of the occurrence of strand plants 
upon mountains.
Plantago muritiiiia might be added to those already 
mentioned.
Anneria maritima did not occur at the highest elevations.
He had induced Professor Voelcker to analyse the ashes of this plant 
from its most inland situation in Scotland, ^q.\\ ]\IacDhui.
They con- 
tained less soda and more potash than strand plants, and no iodine, 
Avhich was present in the latter.
Professor E.
P. Wright admitted the 
importance of the distinction which had been laid down.
He supposed, 
however, that it would not be contended that such a thing as true

mimicry miglit not exist amongst plants.
'Mr. R.
Trimen sfiid that it 
had occurred to iiim that it might be an advantage to a phuit to adopt tlie 
habit of one which was poisonous, and so be passed over by herbivorous 
animals.
The instances which hatl been adduced related to the vegetative 
organs alone.
He remembered a case mentioned by Harvey,* where two 
South African plants growing intermingled coidd only be distinguished by 
careful inspection.
Professor Lawson thought tliat it was notwholly true 
th.it minuekiug plants were separated in their habitats.
He had been struck 
with this in seeeing Villarsia uymphoideH and Nymphaa nlha growing to- 
gether.
Dr. Lankester considered that in Darwin's theory of natural se- 
lection would be found the ultimate solution of these strange resemblances.
The iuHuence of the mineral food of plants was a very impoitant considera- 
tion in their growth.
Professor Thiselton Dyer in reply said that though 
he had not pretended to do more than indicate the direction in which 
he thought a solution of'these problems might eventually be obtained, yet 
he considered that the tone of the discussion su|)ported him in his views.
He was quite prepared to allow that real protective resemblance might 
occur amongst plants.
Plants certainly grew together which resembled 
one another very closely in their foliage.
Tlie excessively rare Menziesia 
Cfjeridm had been protected, at any rate, from the rapaciousness of botanists 
by the more plentifid EmpeLrran nigrum on the Sow of Athol being mis- 
taken for it.
Dr. Murie, " On the Development of Fungi within the

not present any characters in the drawings by means of which it could 
be determined with any certainty as to whether they were an imperfect 
condition of a Mucediue or an Alga.
They consisted of slender filaments, 
mixed with small elliptical spore-like bodies; the whole collected together 
into a pale greenish spot.
Mr. Cooke and Professor Perceval Wright 
were of opinion that they were rather of an algoid than a fungal character.

in closed cavities as conclusive arguments for the truth of the so-called

Mr. A.
G. 
More, F.L.S., called the attention of the meeting to some fine living spe- 
cimens of Spirauthes gcmmipara, Lindl., or S.
liovianzoviana, Cham., as 
it had lately been renamed.
The plant had been collected by himself 
during an excursion lately made to Bereliaven, the only European locality 
where this Orchid is known to occur, and the specimens, though obtained 
now three weeks ago, still exhaled the delicious and delicate perfume 
which is characteristic of the L'ish Ladies'-tresses.
Mr. A.
G. More, 
F'.L.S., also made some remarks on Eriophorum alpinnm, L., observing 
that his frieiul and colleague Dr. Moore, had, he believed, been iirt posed 
upon when he aimounced it as an Irish plant (see Journ.
of Bot. V.
* Sarcoci/phula G'errardi and Sitrcosfciiima vimi'ialr, both asclepiads, which grow 
intertwined, and can only be told by examination of their tlowcrs (see ' Thestiuriis 
Caponsis,' ii.
p. 58).
280 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
p. 46).
Mr. More had himself visited the alleged locality, near Mill- 
street, and, after a search of raanv hours on the borders of the lake, satis- 
fied himself that there is no trace of E.
alpinum in that locality.
Dr.
Moore had also, during another season, taken great pains in searching for 
the plant, but did not succeed in finding it, and the authors of the 
' Cybele Plibernica ' now both believe either that Scirpiis c^sspitosiis, 
whose spikes are often slightly woolly with the growth of the bristles, 
were mistaken for it, or that some mistake was made in transmitting the 
specimens sent from Cork by Mr. Sullivan, which, though seemingly very 
old and battered, belong to the right species.
With regard to the second 
supposed Scottish locality of E.
alplniim, he had the authority of his 
friend Dr. Balfour to say that he had always felt some slight doubt about 
the single specimen found in his herbarium, and this doubt was much in- 
creased on his recognizing the absolute identity of the single specimen 
with others certainly collected in Forfar, and which are glued to the 
same sheet in the University Herbarium.
Hence the plant must for the 
present be erased from the British as well as the Irish Plora.
Pi'ofessor Balfour, after thanking Mr. More for his communication, 
and for the presentation of the plants of Neottla to the Botanic 
Gardens, stated that the specimen of Erlophorum alpinnm, from the 
University Herbarium, was among dried specimens of Scirpus cisspUosus, 
collected by him at Durness, in Sutiierlaudshire, on 21st August, 1827, 
during the first botanical excursion wiiich he took with Dr. Graham, 
when a junior student of the class of botany.
The -plant was glued 
down with specimens of S.
ccesvitosus, and the name and date were 
put down on the label accompanying them.
The plant was not de- 
tected as being Erlophorum.
alpiiinm till many years afterwards.
There 
can be no doubt that the plant was among the specimens of the 
Sutherland Scirpus ccespitosm ; if not collected at the same time as these, 
it is not easy to account for its appearance there.
Professor Balfour never 
collected Erlophorum alpinum, at Restennet, and the only specimens in 
his herbarium were presented to him by Sir W.
Hooker in 1837 and 
1838.
Tiiese specimens, being very precious, were glued down at once in 
Professor Balfour's herbarium, and there were no duplicates.
If, as Mr.
More thinks, the specimen has been accidentally placed among the Scirpus 
caspltosus, it is not easy to conjecture how this has taken place, for dupli- 
cates of ErlopJioruni alpinum are certainly not easily procured.
How- 
ever, the only way in which the matter could be settled would be by 
undertaking a visit to Durness, and endeavouring to find the plant again.
Professor Babington hoped that the retired locality of the Splrnnlhes 
would preserve it from extirpation.
It was a most interesting plant ; it 
was at first identified with an American species by Sir W.
Hooker, a view 
in which he himself at one time agreed, but as to which he was not now 
certain, in fact it was probably uncertain.
Latterly Professor Reichenbach 
had identified it with the Kamtchatkan Roinanzoviana, but of the propriety 
of this he had doubts.
Erlophorum alpinum was certainly an unfortunate 
aftair ; an imposition had been attempted upon Dr. Moore.
A similar 
thing happened at the British Association at Cork.
The Irish locality must 
certainly be given up.
The Scotch plant was a more difficult matter ; a 
lal)el had, however, been probably misplaced.
He himself did not think 
that it grew in N.
Sutherliuidshire, though inasmuch as the plant was a 
native of N.
Europe, this was not an unlikely locality.

Mr. Gwyn JettVeys remarked on tlie injury to science 
from the rapacity of collectors.
Professor Balfour thought this was 
overrated.
Plants were not easily extirpated by botanists.
The Clova 
rarities showed no signs of diminution.
Professor Balfour exhibited

division) in Edinburgh Botanic Garden.
Professor Thisellon Dyer 
mentioned the effect of spiral twisting, in Galium and Dlpsacns, in con- 
verting a verticillate into a spiral arrangement of leaves.
Tliis must 
be distingnish'xl from the conversion of a verticil into a spiral by mere 
elongation of the internodes, in which case there is no twisting of 
the axis.
W. A.
Lewis, " A Proposal for a Modification of the strict 
Law of Priority in Zoological Nomenclature in certain cases." This 
paper gave rise to a discussion on the whole subject of priority.
There 
was a strong feeling amongst the botanists and entomologists present 
to condemn bibliographical resurrectionists of obsoh-te names.
Pro- 
fessor Babington thought a name in use in foreign books should be 
adopted to the sacrifice of our own, if really possessed of a prior claim.
He allowed, however, that there was a raking up which was very objec- 
tionable.
There was, it was true, an undoubted right to upset a generally 
received name by one found in an obscure memoir or inaugural disserta- 
tion, but it was a right which should remain in abeyance.
It was justi- 
fiable to correct a name which turned out to be wrongly applied ; this was 
a proper recognition of the penetration and correctness of an overlooked 
writer.
As a mere result of obscure bibliography, the resurrection of 
obsolete names was a system which should be put a stop to.
Professor 
'J'hiselton Dyer advocated common-sense as a useful principle in the 
matter.
It would be absurd to upset the name of Polygonnm, Persi- 
cnria because applied to another species in the Linntean Herbarium.
Too much attention shoidd not be paid to the practice of French writers ; 
they were notoriously perverse in such matters, witness their maintaining 
the sole breach of uniformity in the nomenclature of the chemical elements, 
in calling nitrogen azote, in opposition to the practice of every other 
country.
Canon Tristram thought common-sense a dubious principle.
Other speakers addressed the section from the zoological stand-point.
Mr. J.
Sadler, "On the Species of Grimuiia (including SchistiJiiiiii) 
as represented in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh." The principal dis- 
tinction separating Schlsti/Hicm from Griininiu rests on the arbitrary 
character of the adhesion or partial adhesion of the columella to the lid, 
and should be neglected.
In Greville's 'Flora Edinensis ' (1834-), six 
species are described as occurring within ten miles of Edinburgh.
In 
Balfour and Sadler's 'Flora ot Edinburgh' (I8(i3), ten species are 
eiuunerated ; in the second edition (1871) this is increased to fifteen.
Ten of these occur upon Arthur's Seat.
AVith the exception of G.lrlcho- 
phylla they are found to prefer the amygdaloidal trap, and very rarely 
occur on the basalt in a very stunted and starved condition.
At one,part 
of the hill, where the upj)cr drive cuts the rocks to the back of the 
basaltic columns of Samson's Ribs, there is an area of very limited extent 
where the whole ten species can be collected in a few minutes.

paper concluded with notes on the arrangement and distribution of the

J. Birkbeck Nevins, " On 
the Changes which occur in Plants during the Ripening of Seeds." This 
paper consisted of a number of unconnected remarks on changes in tiie 
direction of the pedicel after the expansion of the flower.
In Digitali-H 
and other Scroplmlarinece the seed-vessel becomes erect, otherwise the 
seeds would fall out before they are ripe ; Lim.osella is an obviously ex- 
plicable exception.
In plants such as Cari/ophi/llacece and liuninicnlaceee, 
which flower during summer, the pedicel is usually erect.
In Helhboras 
it is drooping after flowering, the persistent floral envelopes protecting 
the fruit.
The same thing is observable in many autumnal flowering 
plants, such as Tagetes, where the involucre in the drooping inflorescence 
roofs over, as it were, the fruits.
The author concluded by propounding 
his views as to tlie morphology of Cruciferous fruit.
The replum and 
placentas he regarded as a continuation of the axis bearing two terminal 
leaves, which, becoming reflexed, adhere to the axis, and are, in fact, the 
valves of the capsule ; when the ca|)sule ripens the adhesion relaxes, and 
the leaves uncoil.
Professor Wyville Thomson remarked that the facts 
detailed in the paper were familiar enough as a matter of description, but 
were interesting in a teleological point of view.
He doubted whether the 
explanation of the fruit in Vrucifvrcc would find much acceptance amongst 
botanists.
Professor Thiselton Dyer, " On the Minute Anatomy of the 
8tem of the Screw-pine {Vandanus utilis)." Except that the tissues are 
less indurated, the general structure of the stem and the arrangement of 
the flbro-vascular bundles resembles that met with in Palms.
The 
bundles, however, are somewhat remarkable, from containing vessels 
which belong to the scalariform type.
In a transverse section these 
bundles are seen to become smaller towards the circumference and more 
condensed, forming a well-defined boundary to the narrow cortical portion 
of the stem.
The Ijundles are, however, continued through the cortical 
portion, but are reduced to little more than a thread of prosenchyma.
In 
the cortex there are numerous large cells, containing raphides ; these also 
occur in the rest of the stem, but are less frequent.
Crystals of another 
kind are found in connection with the fibro-vascular bundles.
These are 
contained each in a squarish-shaped cell, forming part of a string or 
chain.
A number of these strings are distributed round the circum- 
ference of each fibro-vascular bundle; they are especially abundant in its 
cortical continuation, as they do not suffer a degradation proportionate 
to that of the other constituent tissues.
This peculiar arrangement of 
crystal-bearing cells seems probably unique.
The crystals are four-sided 
prisms with pyramidal apices.
They are almost certainly composed of 
calcium oxalate, though they are too minute and isolated with too much 
difficulty to allow of their satisfactory examination.
Professor Dickson 
was much struck with the peculiar arrangement of the bundles in the dia- 
gram ; proscncliyma mixed with vessels was shown both upon their inside 
and outside.
He was doubtful as to Professor Thiselton Dyer's cxplana-

He 
li.id himself ascertained the occurrence of extremely large scalariform 
ducts in SiiiUax. It was evident that geologists should be careful in de- 
termining plants from the nature of the vessels.
Professor Wyville 
Thomson said that the chain-like crystal-bearing tissue would, if it proved 
characteristic oF Screw-pines, be a valuable menus of determining {\w, na- 
ture of some fossil monocotyledoiious stems.
Neil Stewart, " Observa- 
tions on the Intimate Structure of Spiral Ducts in Plants, and their 
Kelationship to the Flower." It is to be regretted that this pap;^r was 
permitted to be read.
It exhibited a fundamental misconception of the 
most elementary points in vegetable minute anatomy.
A considerable 
portion of the paper was devoted to the description of "a vascular 
system" within the epidermal cells of a Hose-petal, "rivalling in com- 
plexity the structure of the human eye." [A reference to Carpenter's

attempted to describe.]

— Professor Balfour, " On the Cultivation of Tpccacuanlia in 
tlie Edinburgh Botanic Garden for transmission to India." Besides the 
plant which had long been in the garden, what was apparently another 
species had been received from Dr. Gunning.
It resembles more than 
the garden plant the figure of Martins.
The leaves were more pointed 
and less leathery.
Professor W.
C. Williamson, " On the Classification 
of the Vascular Cryptogamia, as affected by recent Discoveries among the 
Fossil Phints of the Coal-measures." The author thought that justice 
had never been done to Professor King, of Galvvay.
He did not say that 
his paper (' Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,' 1844) was accurate 
either in details or in its broad features, but thought, nevertheless, that 
the value of the communication had never been recognized.
He wished 
to insist on the exogenous growth of the woody axis belonging to stems 
of the Carboniferous Cryptogams.
In Calamites, which, though not ex- 
actly Ecpiisetaceae, were tiieir representatives, the central pitli was sur- 
rounded by a cylinder of wedges resembling those of young Dicotyledons.
These wedges sometimes not less than two inches in thickness, and wholly 
vascular, were a clear proof of exogenous growth.
Amongst Lycopodia- 
ceous plants, Adolphe Brongniart distingnished Lepidodendroid and 
Sigillarian plants.
In Sigillaria there were two distinct zones, but in 
Lepidudendron there was no such arrangement ; these he I'egarded as Ly- 
copodiacea, but Sigillnrins as gyninosperms.
However, he (Professor 
Williamson) was in a position to show that in Lepidodeiidron there is a 
representative of the second ring.
Lepidodendron, according to his view, 
lias a vascular pith, surrounded by a true woody zone, from which bundles 
are given oif.
The specimen had been carefully figured by Carrnthers, 
though he differed from him in details, especially in asserting the existence 
of medullary ra\ s.
There was a very elaborate cortex, very corky in some 
plants, very fibrous in otiiers.
The Sujillarin vascularis, of Binney, in- 
cludes two forms, one in which tlie medulla is dilfercntiated into medul- 
lary cells, and peripheral vessels ('medullary zone'), and the woody zone 
exhibits mechillary rays.
Tlie Dlploxj/Jon of Corda, has proved tiiat' ravs 
do not proceed from the medulla, but from the woody zone.
In Stigmaria 
he also maintained that the vascular bundles proceeding from rootlets are 
derived from tlie cylinder and not from the medulla.
In these plaids, as an 
evolutionist, he looked upon the ' medullary zone' as corresponding to the 
284 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
' medaliary slieatli' in recent plants.
The consideration of the extinct 
forms of higher Cryptogams showed him tliat tlie term Acrogens must be 
given up, and led him to propose their division into two groups, correla- 
tive with those of Phanerogams.
Amongst Cryptogamic Exogens he 
would include Equisetacece, Lycopodiacea, hoetacefs.
The Ferns would 
constitute the Endogeus.
Mr. Carruthers congratulated Professor Wil- 
liamson on his acquaintance with Professor King's paper, which he (Mr.
Carruthers) had been the means of bringing to his notice.
The so-called 
' vascular pith,' according to his view, was entirely composed of vessels, 
some very short ; anything like the truncated cellular tissue shown in the 
diagram was not shown by the specimens.
Dr. Hooker had suggested 
the term ' utricles' for these, as a kind of compromise between vessels and 
cells.
The structure of Fern stems was precisely that of Stigmaria ; 
from the vascular cylinder pass off vascular bundles carrying,' with them a 
considerable quantity of cellular tissue.
In llywenoj)hjUam, however, 
there was the opposite arrangement, a vascular axis instead of a cylinder; 
so that, according to Professor Williamson, Ferns woidd be split up into 
two groups.
The vascular bundles were scattered in some Lycopodlacece, 
but in Lycopodiam they were united into a central axis, and this was 
precisely the same as in Lepldodcndron.
Classification must be based 
entirely on the reproductive organs.
Professor Dickson thought the 
' vascular pith' was undoubtedly a central axis.
Be should like to know 
what distinct evidence there was of the existence of a cambium layer.
Prof.
McNab could not agree with Prof.
Williamson in his interpretation 
of the structure of these stems.
Botanists are all agreed in this, that 
Lepldodendrou and their allies are closely related to the Lycopods.
Now we 
know that the Lycopods, like the Ferns, have closed fibro-vascular bundles 
Avhich can only grow for a certain time, and then, all the cambium being 
converted into permanent tissue, growth must cease.
The key to these 
structures is to be met with in Lycopndinm ChanKTcyparissus, in which 
we have a cylinder of wood-cells surrounding the central cylinder of united 
fibro-vascular bundles.
This cylinder of wood-cells represents and is a 
mere modification of the cellular tissue met with in the ordinary stems of 
Lycopods.
In this wtiy it follows that the central portion is not a pith, 
but consists of the central group of fibro-vascular bundles.
It also follows 
that the wood cylinder in these stems is not the homologue of the wood 
cylinder of an ordinary exogen.
He thought the classification of these 
plants proposed by Prof.
Williamson quite untenable.
Prof.
Thiselton 
Dyer was glad that Prof.
Williamson had at last brought his jiapers to 
the section where they could be properly discussed.
He thought it was 
a great mistake to dissociate, as was so frequently done, the study of 
extinct from that of recent forms.
The proposed arrangement seemed to 
him to violate all the canons of natural classitication.
It was impossible 
to separate Eqiusetacefe from Ferns.
It was a caricature of evolution to 
hint any analogy between Prof.
Williamson's ' medullary zone ' and the 
medullary sheath.

basalt, which also bursts through the sedimentary rocks in the form of 
dykes.
On the debris of the qunrries two rare plants were found, viz.
Lithospermuiii officinale and Orobanchf rubra, the latter on the roots of the 
wild Thyme {Thy m us Serpyllum^.
Those present had a good opportunity 
of verifying the fact, as the plants were easily dug out of the loose debris 
and the connection observed.
In the Deer Park, not far from the 
quarries, is the only Irish habitat for the Musk Moschatel {Arh.vri mosclia- 
tellinn).
It grows here in small quantity, and completely hidden under 
large blocks of stone.
It has been known in this station for forty years 
at least, and is evidently quite wild, there not being a trace of any intro- 
duced plants in the Park, save the trees so recently planted.
It hnd 
been announced that at this excursion the habitat of a rare Fern would 
be indicated, and a special prize was ottered by one of the members for the 
first specimen discovered, one of the conditions being that none of the 
plants were to be removed.
Accordingly, on leaving the quarries the party 
were taken higher up the hill, and the field was pointed out in vvhich the 
Moonwort (^Botrychium Lvnariu) grows very sparinglv.
This rare little 
fern only grows to a heighl of two to four inches, ancl is usually hidden 
by the Grass and other larger plants ; consequently the contest was a 
pretty severe test of keenness of sight and powers of observation.
In a 
short time the rain commenced agnin to pour down in torrents, accom- 
panied with thunder and lightning, so that the search had to be continued 
under shelter of umbrellas.
Ultimately Mr. F.
A. Lockwood was declared 
the winner, and the prize (Seemaini's ' British Ferns at One View ') was 
handed to him by the chairman of the day, Rev. George Robinson, A.M.
The Adder's-tongue Fern was plentiful in the same field, and also the 
Yellow-oat Grass {JFrisetum Jlavescens).
Specimens were also collected 
here of the Frog Orchis {Habenaria viridls) and of the greater Butterfly 
Orchis {H.
cJilorrinthn) .
The party now pursued their course to the 
summit of the mountain, visiting the well-known MacArt's Fort and the 
caves.
A rare species of Hawkweed, Ilieracium anglicum, was found 
plentifully on the cliffs, as also the Red-broom Rape, already noticed.
The Filmy Fern {HyinenrxfihyUnni.) is said to have been found on this 
part of the hill, but time did not allow of any search for it.
Chemico-Aqricultural Society of Ulster.
— June 16///.
— 
Thomas Baldwin, Esq., Superintendent of the Agricultural Department 
of National P](lucation, made an oral communication on " The Culture 
of Suirar Beet in Ireland." From what he had seen in France, Germany, 
and Belgium, he believed that in Ireland there were 6,000,()(J0 acres 
suitable tor its growth in the regular rotations so far, at least, as soil was 
concerned.
The beet, however, might contain n large proportion of sac- 
charine matter, and yet not be very profitable for nuuuifncturing purposes ; 
for, if it contained too nuieh saline matter, the saccliarine matter would 
be prevented from crystallizing.
He took a great deal of pains to C9m- 
pare the climate of Iklgium with that of Ireland.
He compared the 
returns of the rainfall and temperature obtained in Brussels witii those of 
Dublin for ten years, and lie found that in the summer season the average 
temperature of Brussels was about two degrees higher than that of Dub- 
lin ; while the average winter temperature of Dublin was two degrees 
Z8b PUOCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
liiglier than tliat of Brussels.
Thus the mean temperature of both was 
alike.
Now the cultivation of the beet in Belgium succeeded admirablj', 
and he was in a position to satisfy them, and hoped to prove conclu- 
sively, that so far as climate was concerned, it would succeed in Ireland 
too, and that the slightest diflerence of temperature in summer and winter 
was immaterial, thou^',h, of course, temperature was a material element in 
the growth of any crop.
Some persons Avere of opinion that, in order to 
a successful cultivation of sugar beet, not only a high degree of tempera- 
ture was required, but a hot, blazing sun.
This was altogether a mistake ; 
in order to induce the secretion of a large cpianlity of saccharine matter 
in beet, the root lecjuired to be earthed up, and thus shaded from the sun.
Sunh'ght, so far from inducing a large secretion of sugar, was rather 
inimical to it.
After his return from the Continent he grew some speci- 
mens of beet, which were amilysed in order to ascertain their cpinlities.
Some were grown at Glasnevin and some in county Cork, and he would 
just say that the specimens grown in Cork, on a light soil, exceeded any- 
thing grown in France.
In 1870 he grew roots on six different fai'ms in 
different parts of Ireland, including the Model Farm at Ballymoney, in 
this county.
Dr. Hodges analysed six specimens with the following 
result: — No. 1 contained 12"19 per cent, of crystallizalile saccharine 
matter; No. 2, 12-33; No. 8, 12 19; No. 4, 12-22; No. 5, 10-63; 
and No. 6, 9 per cent.
Dr. Voelcker analysed a number of specimens 
grown at the Model Farm in county Cork, on a poor, hungry, gravel 
soil with the following result : — No. 1 contained 9-91 per cent, 
crystallizable sugar; No. 2, 10-60 per cent.; and No. 3, 10-98 
per cent.
Two specimens grown on a light, sandy soil, at the Athy 
Model Farm, and examined by Dr. Voelcker, were found to contain 
10-78 and 10-99 per cent, of crystallizable sugar respectively ; while 
three specimens, grown at the Model Farm, Ballymoney, were found 
to contain 901, 9 37, and 10-52 respectively (see also ' Journal of Bolany,' 
p. 253).
The specimens examined by Dr. Hodges were grown at Glas- 
nevin ; and though the investigations were conducted by different modes, 
the results agreed very closely.
Now, an important question arose, viz., 
what was the quantity of crystallizable sugar that would justil'y the manu- 
facture?
Mr. Beauchamp expressed the opinion that when roots contained 
from 8-50 to 8-75 per cent, of crystallizable sugar, the manufacturer would 
be justified in extracting the sugar, and Mr. Duncan, who hiis established 
a large factory near London, wrote to him to say that anything under 9 
per cent, would scarcely justify the manufacture.
Now, the very lowest 
percentage exhibited by the analysis that had been made was 9 per cent., 
and was equal to the mininuun that had been tixed on as justifying the 
manufacture.
He now came to the question of questions.
He thought he had clearly 
shown that the beet grown in Ireland contained a sufficient percentage of 
crystallizable sugar to justify mamifacture ; and the question now was, 
could the manufacturer give the fai'uier a price that would remunerate him 
for the cultivation ?
He believed he was rather under the mark in stating 
that farmers might easily raise eighteen tons per acre of clean roots — they 
could do this without the slightest dithculty.
Assuming that for carefully 
grown roots 20*.
a ton could be obtained, the farmer wcmld have got 
£18 per acre for his crop, which, he thought, woidd pay very fairly.
Considerable injury had been done to beet cultivation in Ireland by ex- 
PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
287 
aggerated statements about the produce — some putting it down at forty 
or fifty tons per acre.
He would not deal in such statements at all, but 
would confine himself to what he conceived to be the minimum that it 
would be possible to realize.
Mr. Baldwin then gave the results of some 
experiments he had made to asceitain the best position in a rotation of 
crops wiiich the best crop should occupy.
He had grown it after man- 
gold wurtzel and Swedish turnips, and the result in both cases was un- 
satisfactory.
He grew it on stubble, the preceding crop having been 
grass, and he found the very best results.
On comparing his notes with 
Mr. Beauchamp's, he found that the best results were always obtained 
when the crop was grown on soil intermediate between rich and poor, 
always assuming it to be deeply and skilfully tilled.
The opinion of the 
best growers of sugar beet on the Continent was that the wheat crop was 
the best to precede it.
His own experience showed that a very large re- 
turn might be expected after lea oats.
He had no doubt, also, that if it 
was grown after wheat, preceded by potatoes, a capital crop would be the 
result.
The crop should be put in about the beginning and not later than 
the middle of April; and the drills could hardly be made close enough; 
for, if the plants were large, the percentage of ervstallizable sugar would 
be small.
The roots ought to be about 2^ lb.
or 3 lb.
each.
If the beet 
crop was put in after lea oats or lea vvlieat, it woidd be necessary to use a 
ni0(h;rate dressing of farmyard manure — 10 to 12 tons per acre of well- 
rotted dung would be enough.
In the experiments he made, when he 
used as much as 25 tons, the crop was heavy, but the proportion of crvs- 
tallizahle su<i;ar was small.
Mr!
Baldwin recommended every cultivator 
to procure seed from seedsmen of undoubted character, or to grow his own 
seed, and to select those plants which produced the greatest quantity of 
sugar; thus he would increase the sugar-producing qualities of the plants 
— an increase which he thought might be indefinitely extended.
As to 
the harvesting, be had no experience of the proper mode of storing the 
beet for manufacturing purposes.
On the Continent, they began to store 
it when the leaf began to turn yellow, and it was put into sunken pits.
Mr. Baldwin stored it precisely the same as mangold wurtzel.
In connec- 
tion with this, he had to nieiuion that the sanqde analysed by Mr. Beau- 
champ, and which induced him to say it was splendid, was sent immedi- 
ately after the roots were lifted.
Later in tlie season, a sample of the 
same crop was analysed by Di".
Voelcker, and he reported that it only 
contained between 7 and 8 per cent, of crystallizable sugar; and later 
again another sample of the same crop was examined, but only 5 per cent, 
could be found in it.
These were sanqjies of the very same crop which were 
analysed by Mr. Beauchamp immediately after being pulled, and found to 
contain 12 per cent.
This clearly proves the necessity of attending to 
proper storage.
Mr. Baldwin dwelt on the advantage of the beet-root as 
belonging to a family of crops, which, by promoting tillage, liljerated 
plant food and prepared the ground for other crops.
Tiie cultivation of 
beet-root would cause more land to be l)roughl under tillage, and thus 
give more employment to the agricultural popidation, besides furnishing 
a new source of industry.
In Ireland a state of things existed unparal- 
leled in Eiu'ope.
Half the land was in pasture, one-fourth in waste and 
water, and only one-fourth in tillage.

Among new books are to be especially noticed the second volnnie 
(coinpletino- the work) of M.
C. Cooke's ' Handbook of British Funoi ' 
(MacniiUan), the second volume of the ' Flora of Tropical Africa,' by- 
Prof.

Johnson's 'How Crops Grow.' 
Mr. Carruthers, P'.R.S., has been appointed consulting botanist to the 
Royal Agricultural Society, — a new office.
Dr. August Ncih'eich, a well-known Austrian botanist, died at Vienna 
on June 1st, at the aae of fifty-eight.
He possessed an extensive and 
critical knowledge of the botany of the Austrian empire, and was the 
author of a ' Flora of Vienna ' (1846), a ' Flora of Lower Austria ' (1858, 
with supplements in 1866 and 1869), and very numerous papers in the 
Viennese scientific journals.
His name is preserved in Feuzl's genus of 
Composite, Nellreichia, and in Seiiiperviviim Neilreichii, Schott, and other 
species.
In the person of Dr. Paul Rohrbach, who died on June 3rd, at Berlin, 
before the completion of his twenty-fifth year, one of the most promising 
of the younger botanists of Germany has been lost to science.
He had 
devoted his attention largely to the Caryophyllncere, and his excellent mono- 
graph of the genus Sllfm was noticed in our volume for 1868 (p.
378).
He 
published several useful papers in the ' Linnsea ' and ' Botanische Zeitung,' 
and a monograph of the European species of Typlia in the last volume of 
the Brandenburg Transactions.
At the time of his premature death he 
was at work on the Caryopliyllaceoi and Typhacea: for the ' Flora Brasi- 
liensis.' 
We regret to have also to record the death of Dr. Julius Milde, which 
occurred suddenly, on July 3rd, at ]\Ierau, whither he liad gone for the 
benefit of his health.
He is perhaps best known by his useful ' Filices 
Europae et Atlantidis, Asife Minoris et Siberiae,' published in 1867, and 
his monograph of all known Equisetums in the 'Nova Acta;' but he 
wrote very numerous papers on the higher Cryptogams and Mosses in 
German periodical and transactions, and has contributed a paper on the 
geographical distribution of the Eqnisdaceae to this Journal (see Vol. I.
p. 32), as well as some shorter notes.
His extensive herbaria of European 
Mosses, of Exotic Ferns, and of Duplicate Mosses are for sale at Messrs.
Limpricht, in Breslau.
Professor Henri Lecoq, of Clermont, a man of very varied and exten- 
sive knowledge, has also died quite recently, in his seventieth year.
He 
was the author of numerous treatises on physical geography, general 
botany, horticulture, and geology, and of an elaborate work, in nine 
volumes, on the Botanical Geography of Central Europe (1854-58), 
which is too -little known in this country.
He has left to the town of 
Clermont liis extensive collections of all kinds.

Stem innovating dichotomously 1-2 in.
high, flexile, reddish, bearing lax radicles at the lower part from the axils 
of the leaves.
Leaves approximated, erect when moist, and often some- 
what secund on the young shoots, rather soft, papillose at back, from a 
narrowly lanceolate base, gradnally subulate, channelled, with a thin 
nerve reaching the apex, the margin not revolute, sharply denticulate 
above and on the back of the nerve ; when dry strongly cirrhate and 
twisted.
Cells at base large cylindraceo-vesieidar, the rest small quadrate 
or subhexagonal, filled with deep green chlorophyll.
Growing in ex-

Identical with original specimens gathered by Carestia 
in the Val d'Intrasca near Verbano.
Trichostonu'Oi.
As the synonymy of this group has been so carefully worked out by 
Professor Ijindberg in his valuable paper " Om de Europeiska Tricho- 
stomea?
" (Oefversigt Kongl.
Yetenskaps Akad.
Porhandlingar, 1S64), I 
take advantage of it to enumerate all our species, availing myself also of 
Mr. Mitten's admirable paper on Fottin (See Journ.
Bot. IX.
(1871) 
p. 2).
This great bryologist takes by far the most philosophical view of 
the group when he advocates the union of Pottia, Desmaiodon, Tricho- 
stovuim and Turlnln, into one natural genus ; as a matter of convenience, 
however, I retain here the three principal, though every one who studies 
them will find that the lengthening of the teeth of Trlchodomvm, and 
their twisting into those of Torlalci, is so gradual that it is difficult to 
draw the line between them, while it separates such closely allied species 
as Tri.ch.
cyjiiidricum and Tort, turtnosa.
In Turtula I adopt the sections 
used by De Notaris.

ON THE FLORA OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
By Robert Tucker, M.A.
The warmest thanks of all persons interested in the botany of the Isle 
of Wight are due to Mr. A.
G. More for his full Sujiplement to Dr.
Bromiield's excellent ' Flora Vectensis,' contained in previous numbers of 
this Journal.
His labours and successes in this held are second only to 
(if not on a par with) those of his lamented predecessor.
If it were 
not too much to expect from one who has so many calls upon his time 
already, one could wish that he would concentrate his powers in the 
drawing up a new Flora of the district, eschewing the descriptions given 
by Dr. Bromheld, and modelled (as I have suggested, Vol. VHI.
p. 158) 
on the ' Flora of Middlesex ' type.
It might be brought out as the first 
part of the long-lookcd-lbr 'Flora of Hants.' A "handy-book" to the 
I)otany of the Island is.
I think, a real desideratum ; and as no one is so 
competent for the work as Mr. More, I hope, if he reads these remarks; 
he will consider the matter favourably and " make a note of it." 
In such a work as Dr. Bromiield's there are, of course, nuuiy little 
inaccuracies ; and the number of these was most likely increased by the 
circumstances under which the work was edited.
I may, perhaps, point 
out some before I dose mv remarks.
'I'here arc some few also which I

have detected in tlie Supplemental Notes.
I shall not dwell very particu- 
larly upon these, but first recorti some few additional localities of" my own, 
principally detected in the years 1864 and 1865.
Following Mr. More's 
example, I shall endeavour not to give any which have been recorded 
elsewhere publicly.
I do not know if the MSS.
observations made by 
Dr. Bromfield in his interleaved copy of the ' Flora liantoniensis ' (pre- 
served at Kew) have appeared in print, but shall forbear to give them.

There is a slight confusion in the ' Flora Vectensis ' in the case of some 
few plants as to book authorities, cf.
Mentha rotund'ifolia and M.
piperita, 
with the Bot. Guide and Fl. Vectiana ; also the Doctor omits generally 
to give Mr. Snooke's references to lirst discoverers (this last writer, how- 
evei', is not always correct).
But I must only further refer to the subject of localities by citiug one 
or two additional extracts, besides those which I have given in former 
numbers.
The author of ' Holiday Excursions of a Naturalist ' writes, 
that he found " Tkesium on' the chalk downs (p.
50); near Luccombe, 
under the cliffs, gi-ew the LatJii/rns sylvestris, ]\'Iadder, and Asperula 
cynanchica'' (p.
53) ; " we found Orchis fusca in a thicket in the Under- 
cliff; Irisfoelidissiiiia abounded in places — Monotropa and Sileue ai/glica, 
also to be found," this at Ventnor (p.
53) (has O.
fusca really been 
found in the island ?) ; then at Clarisbrooke " we picked Thesium below 
the castle walls, and Astragalus Ibj poijlottis and Teucriuni Chanuedrys 
are also to be found in this locality" (p.
56).
As regards the last two 
plants our author is evidently quoting from ancient authority, which had 
perhaps no solid foundation in fact.
In Priscilla Wakefield's 'Family Tour through the British Empire,' 
15th ed.
IS^O) 1 find that (p.
455) near Ventnor "the elegant wood- 
vitch, larger tumitory, and wild maddor (so are the plants named) were 
presented to the young botanists." 
As I have elsewhere stated ('Science Gossip,' 1870, p.
261), there are 
thirty-two Isle of Wight plants given in the ' Hampshire Repository List.' 
These are cited in the ' Flora Vectensis ' as due to Pulteuey ; the author's 
explanation of the matter is given in the ' Phytologist,' vol.
iii.
p. 428.
'J'he authors of the 'Botanist's Guide' (1805) quoted this list as 
Pnlteney's, yet they could hardly have seen it, I think, as they omit 
references to sixteen of the Isle of Wight plants, and other plants, as I 
have shown (S.
G. I.e. supra), they quote as on Pulteney's authority, 
which are not included in the list.
These last may possibly have been 
taken from the 'Catalogue of Plants of Dorset." As the Vectensian 
plants in this list are so few, and the work is a scarce one, I have thought 
it well to transcribe it.

but Nartheciiim he refers to " Messrs.

rest he apparently ignores, so far as the ' Hampshire Repository ' list is

Pulteney question at rest.

In my copy of the ' Flora Vectiana ' are some few localities written in 
pencil by a former possessor, one or two of which are of interest.
The 
app-arauce of the writing leads me to the conjecture that they were made 
before the publication of the Fl. Vectensis : — " Verbena, near Brading ; 
Si/mphijlam officinale, Sandown ; Euphorbia exigua.

near St. Lawrence ; Marrubium.
vuJgare, between St. Lawrence and Mira- 
bles ; Iris fmlidissima , near Mirables." 
I can only, in conclusion, add again that I trust we shall soon see a 
new ' Flora Vectensis ;' and that, should a list of names of subscribers be 
called for, one may be made iqi sufficiently large to warrant any compe- 
tent botanist iu undertaking its preparation.
NOTES ON SOME IRISH PLANTS.
By David Moore, Ph.D., M.R.I.A.
During the last week of May this year, when botanizing on the Ben- 
bidben range of limestone hills, in county Sligo, along with Professor 
This(!lton Dyer, wc pi(;ked up a few bits of Draha rapestris, on that part 
of the range known locally as King's Mountain, [t was growing 'along 
with Arenaria ciliata, Draba incana, and Saxifraya aizoides, but seemed 
to be very rare ; only two small plants were got of it.
This species has been recorded before as an Irish plant, being marked 
as such in i'rol'cssor Babington's ' Manual of British Botany,' 2nd edi- 
tion.
At the time when publishing our ' Cyi)clc llibcrnica,' my colleague 
300 ON MONOTROPA HYPOPITVS.
A. G.
More communicated with Professor Babington about this phint, 
who stated he had kept no note of the precise station, we therefore felt 
uncertain about it, and considered it safest to exclude the plant.
I 
have since learned that Mr. W.
Andrews, whose exertions in exploring 
parts of the flora of Ireland are well known, had either collected the plant 
himself on the Benbulbeu Range or had seen specimens collected there by 
the late Mr. Wynn, of Sligo.
It is also recorded in Witliering's ' Botany,' 
on the authority of the late Professor E.
Murphy, who, we believe, knew 
he had made a mistake in taking Draba incana for it.
Amidst these 
uncertainties, it is now satisfactory to know that the plant has again been 
seen in its Irish habitat.
It is also interesting in a geographical point of 
view, this being the only portion of Ireland where the true alpine type of 
plants has yet been known to occur.
At a later period of the season, end of June, we visited the locality near 
Mullingar, where I had the previous year discovered Pi/rola rotimdlfolia, 
for the lirst time in Ireland, and where we were able to collect a tolerably 
good supply of specimens of it in good condition.
At page 209 of Vol. VIII.
of ' Journal of Botany,' I have a short notice 
of an alpine Willow, which I collected on the top of Muekish, a high 
mountain in county Donegal, wdiich could not be well identified with 
any of our known species.
Mr. Baker, who compared the specimens with 
those of the British Willows in the Kew Herbarium, thought it nearest 
to the plant named Salix GraJiami, specimens of which were there from 
the Sow of Athol, Scotland.
The smooth germens aiad snioolh pedicels of 
the Irish plant inclined me to think it nearer to a form of Sallv Arbmcida.
Since the publication of the article in question, I was able to get living 
plants of S.
Graltami, from Athol, which I had planted along with the 
Mui'kish plant, and now both are growing freely near to each other, show- 
ing, as they do, unmistakably, that they belong to the same species, only 
differing in some minor points, such as plants of the same species from 
different localities frequently assume.
This opinion has also been con- 
firmed by the Rev. J.
E. Leefe, who is a well-known authority on British 
Willows.
Mr. Leefe has further assisted me to correct an error we com- 
mitted in ' Cybele Hibernica,' in considering Sallx prociimbens an Irish 
plant.
The Benbulbeu Willow, mentioned under that species, is a 
dwarfed, decumbent form of one of the states of S.
phyllc'ifolia.
ON MONOTROPA HYP OP IT FS, L.
By Ered.
Stratton, F.L.S.
This plant, which has not been noted in the Isle of Wight for more 
than twenty years, has recently been rediscovered.
Mrs. Pretyman, of 
Westover, kindly showed it to me, growing in tolerable abundance under 
Beech and Fir trees, not far from the house at Westover in August last, 
and a few days ago my eldest boy (aged three) found a plant growing 
under Beech at Carisbrooke Castle.
It may be useful to note this recur- 
rence of a plant of the nature of Monotropa after so many years during 
which it has apparently been absent ; at least in the two localities above 
mentioned, in neither of wdiich is it likely that it would have escaped 
observation.
From Westover I was enabled to procure several large 
ON MONOTROPA HYPOPITYS.
301 
masses of the entire plant with the intevlnciiig roots of trees nmongst 
which it nestles, from an examination of wliich I hoped to have ascer- 
tained whether or not tlie ))iant was eiliier wholly or partially parasitic.
Though closely resembling in habit and general appearance Lathrmi 
squauiaria, Mondtropn is not, I believe, parasitic in the same way nor to 
the same extent that that plant is.
In Lathrcea I have succeeded in 
tracing the actual connection between its roots and those of Corylus 
Acdlana, the plant on which it is generally parasitic here ; and I am able 
to confirm in many respects the statements made by Mr. Bowman in his 
paper on LatJircen srjncnnarla in the ' Transactions of the Linnean Society,' 
vol.
xvi.
part 3.
But as regards Monotropa, I have utterly failed to 
discover any immediate or direct communication between it and the roots 
amongst which it lies imbedded, except tliat the fibrous processes which 
envelope the roots or rootstock of Monotropa are closely applied, and to 
some extent adherent, to the roots of the trees.
Both Beech and Pir 
grow around the plants at Westover; and I identified, by the strong 
resinous smell, some of the roots to which the Monotropa rootlets were 
clinging as some kind of Fir. In the station at Carisbrooke Castle only 
Beech-trees occur.
The only discussion of late years upon the subject of 
the parasitism of Monotropa, appears, as far as I can find from the 
resources at my command, to be that in the first volume of the ' Phy- 
tologist,' to which Messrs.
Luxfbrd, Edwin Lees, W.
Wilson, E.
Newman, 
T. G.
Rylands, and others, contributed their observations.
Their opinions 
very widely differed, one of the most striking peculiarities of the plant, 
the fibrous clothing of the roots or underground stem being variously 
considered " the woolly matted extremities of the grasses which grew 
with the Monotropa " "minute spougioles — sent forth in all directions;" 
" spougioles or suckers ;" " fibrous extremities " or " root ;" and lastly, 
" a byssoid fungus." Mr. Kylancis, whose paper shows that he took 
considerable trouble in the matter, was so satisfied that this fibre was a 
fungoid growth, that he discovered and named four distinct species, which 
very pleasingly brouglit together the names of the several investigators — 
Epipliagos Lnxfordii (Ryl. mss.), Zi/f/odemiiis Bcrkeleyi (lUl. mss.), 
Si'pedoniuin TFilsoni (Ryl. mss.), Cladosporium Leesii (Ryl. mss.).
Now 
although "byssoid fungi" may occur naturally enough on the decay- 
ing and dead leaves and other vegetable matter beneath Beech or Fir 
trees, it is extremely difficult to believe that the substance so regularly 
and constantly enveloping the root or rhizome of Monotropa is of a 
fungoid character.
The resemblance which was at once suu'gested to my 
mintl by the appearance of this fibre was to the radicular fibres by which 
common Ivy clings to trees or walls, and this still seems to me to be a 
comparison well warranted by the observations I have been able to make.
The investigations of the well-known botanists whose names are al)Ove- 
mcntioned were conducted just thirty years ago.
It would be very satis- 
factory if English microscopists would, with their greatly advanced know- 
ledge and improved apparatus, turn their attention to the question of the 
parasitism of this and some other plants.
I must confess niysclfciuite unai)le 
to decide whether or not Monotropa is parasitic at all.
No actual connec- 
tion has ever i)een ob-erved ; this seems to be the strongest point, because, 
although extremely difficult to discover and demonstrate, actual connec- 
tion, beyond mere contact, has been proved to exist in the case of Lulhrfra 
and other parasitic plants; and, until this connection has been traced and

seen in Motwtropa, its parasitism must remain a tlieory only, and not an 
observed fact.
On the other hand, with tlie strong presumption of its 
partisitism which the hal)it and appearance of tlie plant warrant, Professor 
Babington's statement (' Manual,' 61h ed.
p. 220), "not parasitical," 
seems to require something more to siipport it than the negative evidence 
hitherto adduced.
Successful cultivation of Moiiotrupa as a non-parasiti- 
cal phmt would be perhaps as nearly positive evidence as the nature of the 
case would admit of, but as far as records go, this has not been done.*

is a question which 1 caunot enter upon fidly, but it may be observed that 
of the four "byssoid fungi " described by Mr. llylands, only one is stated 
to be found " on Monotropa root generally," each of the other three being 
allocated to T^\a.\iis,oi Monotropa found in diH'erent places.
Also that it is 
only the former one that is said to possess the colour which seems to be 
the common characteristic of the fibre — " brown ;" the others being re- 
spectively described as " colourless," " peliucid white," and " pellucid 
straw-colour." Is it probable that a plant whose roots were so entirely 
covered with a fungus could exist, or at least flourish and propagate ?
[Mr. Stratton's experience is that of all botanists who have investi- 
gated the question.
Unger, Graves, Du Ciiartre, Guillard, Schacht, and 
Chatin have all failed to detect the slightest organic connection between 
adult Monotropa and the roots of any otiier plant.
Chatin, however, in 
his beautiful ' Anatomic Coniparee des Vegetaux," has described and 
figured (' Piantes Parasites,' p.
257 and t.
52) a young individual attached 
to a ligneous root by a true perforating vascular cone, exactly as in Oro- 
banclie, and he suggests that, at least when reproduced by germination, 
Monotropa may commence life as a parasite.
Unger (Ann. d.
Wien.
Mus.
Bd. 2) thought that the plant lived ou substances exuded by the roots 
amongst which it grows and with which its own are so intimately inter- 
laced.
Many botanists consider Monotropa a parasite in the sense of living 
on dead or decomposed vegetable matter, like Fungi.
The subject cannot 
be considered settled.

Mr. Kurz had originally con-

Thuidium DECiPiENS, Be Notaris, a British Moss.
— The Rev.
J. Fergusson has contributed a note to ' Science Gossip ' on this Moss, 
which he discovered in the spring of 1868 growing abundantly by the 
side of a streamlet, and about springs on the Ciova mountains, at about 
2800 feet.
The late Mr. Wilson, at the time, considered the plant a 
form of Hypmim commutatum , but Mr. Pergusson, after re-exainination, 
distributed it, in 1870, under the name of Hypnnm rifjidulam, n.

Seedling Willows.
— I have received from Dr. Moore, of Glasnevin, 
some remarks on iny paper published in the August number of the 
'Journal of Botany ' (p.
225), '" On Seedling W^illows," stating his ex- 
perience on the subject, which difl'ers from mine.
Dr. Moore, in the kindest 
manner, has requested me to communicate his observations to yon, but I 
trust the readers of tlie Journal will not be deprived of his observations in 
a more dn-ect form.
Dr. Moore says, " My experience coinciiles with that 
of Sir James Smith, as stated by you in the quotation made in the 
'Journal of Botany ' from 'The English Flora.' " I am glad to admit 
that Dr. Moore has sent me some undoubted seedlings, of one and 
two years old, of <S'.

tricolor, Koch, Ehr., and also 
one gathered near to a plant of S.

I have not heard anything 
of seedlings from any other quarter, and have seen none in my own garden 
this year.
It thus appears that Willows do undoubtedly spring readily 
from seed in the Glisneviu Botanic Garden, where the climate ap])ears 
favourable to their production, and a good opportunity is presented of as- 
certaining whether, as stated by Sir J.
E. Smith, the seedlings thus spring- 
ing up are true to their kind.
I hope Dr. Moore will be able to clear up 
this point also.

A query in the January number of this Journal (p.

Willows and Poplars in this country.

it happens Avith Willows less frequently than is generally supposed.
I was surprised, therefore, to come upon a passage in Linnaeiis's 
' Anta?uitates Academirae ' (vol.
i. p.
100), which speaks of the seminal 
fertility of Willows and Poplars as a thing to be guarded against.
" Ambulacra ex Popnlo vel Salice formare cupiens, solos mares assumat ; 
si enim feinina?
terrae mandentur, multiplicantur, ita ut neinus loco 
ambulacri forment." The advice, however, might merely be an as- 
sumption deduced from the trees being monrecions.
It may, perhaps, 
be a piece of evidence on the other side that De Candolle (' Physiologic 
Vciietale.' ii.
734) remarks, ' Nous posscdons depnis pen les deux sexes dn 
Saule plenrenr (voyez Spenner, PI.
Prib.
iii.
p. 1061), raais lis n'ont pas 
encore produit de graines." However, that Willows are hybridizable is 
proved by the existence of a book, by Max Wichura, entirely devoted to 
the experimental investigation of the subject (' Die Bastardbefruchtung 
. • .
der Weiden,' ISfio).
Mr. Darwin, quoting from it, remarks in the 
'Origin of Species' (4tii ed.
p. 813), "It is known that hybiids raised 
from very distinct species are sometimes weak and dwarfed, and perish at 
an early age, of which fact Max Wichura has recently given some striking 
cases with hybrid Willows." And in his 'Animals and Plants under 
Domestication ' (vol.
ii.
267), he mentions that " Max Wichura united six 
distinct species of Willows into a single hybrid" (by successive crosses).

I noticed about a month ago in one of the tlower-beds, which occupy 
the site of the old reservoir near Grosvenor Gate, Hyde Park, a single seed- 
ling plant of Salix (Jr/prea, L.
This was then about a foot high.
1 did not 
think from its appearance and regularity of growth, vertical as well as lateral, 
that this could be a willow-cutting which had been stuck in to protect 
some young plant, and which had subsequently taken root on its own ac- 
count.
But the plant is easily found if any l)otanist cares to investigate 
the subject further, as the site of the old reservoir does not occupy many 
roods of around.

Middlesex Plants.
— Between Primrose Hill and King Henry's "Road 
I have noticed this year many luxuriant plants of Rnmex pulustrls, a well- 
known but somewhat rarely-occurring meuiber of the London flora.
Near the same place I also found single individuals of Bromiis arvensis 
and Gallmoga parrAJlora.
The occurrence of the last plant is important, 
although it was very far from obvious how its seed had been brought 
there.
If it once gets a firm footing north of the Thames it must, judg- 
ing from its abundance in the neighbourhood of Kew, become one of the 
commonest London weeds.
Between the Adelaide Eoad and Belsize 
Park I have seen this season Bromus secalinus, CUenopod'uim olidum, and 
Lathyrus Aphaca.
This last plant has also occurred this year on the site of 
the Exhibition, South Kensington, where Medicago falcata and Centanrea 
amara have also turned up for the first time.
According to Dr. Boswell- 
Syme, all the Centanrea Jacea he has seen from the neighbourhood of 
London belongs to the form amara.
The Exhibition ground has pro- 
duced abundance of other forms of this plant, but I have not met with 
amara before.

Monstrosity of Viola sylvatica (p.

— Since I took a speci- 
men of the crested Viola to Kew, 1 have been able to collect some curious 
facts on the same subject, which I think worth recording.
From Mr.
Wollaston I have received accounts of two other instances of crested Viola 
that have come under his notice.
One grew in the garden of the late 
Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston, Staflbrdshire, on the corm of Filix-mas 
cridata ; the other in Mr. Wollastou's own garden, very close to PolypoJiiim.

Here there are three 
instances, from Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, and Kent, of the Viola be- 
coming crested wlien growing near crested Ferns.
Scolopendrinm endivee 
folium was first raised at Mr. Young's, at Taunton.
He asserted that it 
was a hybrid bi tween a common Scolopendrinm and an Endive growing 
together.
I suppose no one would believe this, and he was far too good 
a botanist to believe it himself; but it may be another instance of a 
plant copying its neighbour.
I was this week in the garden of Captain 
Jones, of Clifton.
He rears a large number of Fern monstrosities, with 
whicli he is very successful.
But 1 was surprised to find in his houses 
that the air is apparently so charged witli monstrosities that even his 
normal plants acquire abnormal habits.
Thus, his Jsploduni Nidus has a 
bifid frond ; the pinnules of his Woodwnrdia radicans are crested ; and his 
Blechinim anslrale is sagittate.
From all these facts, it seems very pro- 
bable that contiguity has some influence on the forms of plants.
The 
subject is a very interesting one, but 1 am too ignorant in the science of 
vegetable teratology to do more than record the facts.

So far as the neighbourhood of Plymouth 
is concerned, my experience confirms Mr. Watson's statements as to its 
great rarity in the south-west of England, since I never met with it any- 
where here until recently, when I discovered it in two pastures enclosed 
from Crownhill Down, near Plympton.
In one it grows plentifully, but 
in the other only sparingly.

The study of the life-history of the above common spe-

are now mere collectors and systematists.
Nolte has described and 
figured, in his essay on Stratiotes and Sagittaria, corm-like tubers, closely 
similar to those of the latter plant, in Alisma, which do not seem to have 
been observed, or at least properly understood in this country.
Like 
those of S'jgitturia, they are buds remaining dormant through the winter, 
and containing a store of nutriment, to be employed in the development 
of the new plant from the tuber iu the next year.

THE LOCAL FIELD CLUBS OF GREAT BRITAIN.
By James Britten, F.L.S.
VIII.
The Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club.
Tliis very important body was established in 1851 for the practical 
study of the natiu-al history of Herefordshire and the adjoinino- districts ; 
taking its name from the valley of WooHiope.
At the date of the forma- 
tion of the Club scarcely anything was known of the fanna or flora of the 
county, and for several years it contined its work to cataloguing the 
various natural productions of the district; the results of these observa- 
tions being referred to in the successive annual addresses of the Presi- 
dents.
The work already achieved by the Club is so important and so 
comprehensive, that it would be impossible to give any account of it in 
detail ; the following observations are, therefore, merely descriptive of the 
botanical portion, it being remembered tliat almost every other branch of 
natural history has met with similar attention.
For the particulars we 
are mainly indebted to Dr. Bull, of Hereford, a very energetic member of 
the Club, and one to whom it owes no small portion of its success.
The first botanical paper was read in 1853, by Flavell Edmunds, Esq., 
" On the Distribution and Causes of Colour iu Plants ; " the next was 
an important one, on " The Mistletoe in Herefordshire," by Dr. Bull, 
which has been printed in extenso in our pages,* and, therefore, requires 
no further remark.
It was not, however, until 1866 that the Club came 
prominently into notice.
In that year the first of the annual volumes of 
Transactions, to which it mainly owes its reputation, was issued.
These 
volumes, occu))ying as they do a position midway between the more 
strictly scientific Transactions of the Tyneside Naturalists and the pro- 
ceedings of such societies as the Manchester Field-Naturalists, are of con- 
siderable importance as favourable illustrations of "popular science;" 
while the local bearing of their contents renders them quite in keeping 
with the scope of a local society.
They are so large, and so fully illus- 
trated, that it is a matter of surprise how they can be produced at the 
cost stated in the balance sheet.
The way in which this is managed is 
worthy of note, and may give a hint to other local clubs.
In 186G 
an arrangement was made with tiie proprietor of the ' Hereford Times,' 
whith has a large circulation in the West of England, that the pro- 
ceedings of the Club should be reported in full as ordinary news, and 
that the type employed for this purpose should be reset in octavo 
shape for the Transactions.
In this way the proceedings were widely 
published, created great interest, and encouraged the study of natural 
history among the public throughout the district (thus fulfilling one great 
object of sucli a Club) ; and the Club had only to pay for the time occu- 
pied in resetting, etc., with such additions and illustrations as might be 
thought necessary.
From this date an account of the proceedings' was 
always published, in which all the papers read appeared at length ; and, 
it being found that an ordinary reporter was scarcely equal to the task, 
the work was undertaken by Dr. Bull, who is also the able editor of the 
yearly volumes.

publication of the year, however, was the first part of the " Flora of Here-

It consists of a description of 
the districts into which the county has been divided, with an excellent 
map; a sketch of the geology, by the Rev. W.

" Illustrations of the Edible Fungi of Herefordshire," by Dr. Bull, with 
original drawings on stone, coloured by some ladies of the county.
These 
illustrations have been continued from year to year, three coloured plates 
appearing in each volume.
Although all the species noticed are more 
or less common, and the papers might therefore equally illustrate the 
Fungi of any other county, it is to them that the origin of the 
repute the Club has now attained in fungology may be mainly attributed.
In 1868 Dr. Bull, representing the Club, took the first prize at the 
Royal Horticultural Society's show for the best collection of edible 
Fungi ; ami in the same year a special meeting, to l)e held on(;e every 
season for a " foi'ay among the funguses," was established.

Many of the above papers are illustrated liy coloured plates, and it may 
be observed that all other branches of science are equally well represented

It is a practical testimony to the local estimation in 
which the Transactions are held that the earlier volumes have long been 
out of print, and it is now scarcely possible to obtain a complete s^t.
If 
we might offer a hint, it would be that a larger edition of future volumes

SUGGESTIONS ON FRUIT CLASSIFICATION.
By Alexanuek Dickson, M.D., 
Regms Professor of Botaiitj iit the Uuiversiti/ of Glasgow.
{Read at the Meeting of the British Association, at Edinburgh, August 8, 1871.) 
Dr. Dickson referred to the confessedly unsatisfactory state of fruit- 
classification, and to the very unnecessary extent of the existing termi- 
nology, which is further complicated by a considerable amount of variance 
among botanists as to the precise application of several of the terms em- 
ployed.
He was of the opinion, wliicii lie believed to be a growing one 
among botanists, that the most convenient method of classitication was, 
in the first place rigorously to restrict the dctinition of a "fruit" to the 
mature or ripe pistil, excluding froui that delinition those modifications of 
accessory parts or organs which, in many cases, are correlated therewith ; 
and, secondly, to base the primary classification upon the general character 
of the modification und(;rgone by the parts of tiie pistil in ripening, treat- 
ing as of minor importance the characters involved in the (lescri[)ti(jn of 
the llower, such as the superior or inferior position of the ovary, etc.
T'he classification which Dr. Dickson suggests for tin; consideration of 
botanists approaches most nearly to that indicated by Schneht in his 
' (jlrniidriss,' of which, indeed, it may be viewed as a modification and 
expansion.

As this last group is very

Dr. Dickson prefers to consider berries, drupes, and 
achenes severally, as forms of equal value with capsules or scliizocarps, 
and therefore would divide fruits into five groups, viz.
Capsules, Schizo-

As relVactory 
exceptions, however, may be mentioned those cases where the seed, minus 
its testa, is the part ultimately disseminated ; for example — in Oxalis 
where, on dehiscence of the capsule, the elastic testa becomes ruptured, 
violently expelling the body of the seed with the tegmen ; or in the 
so-called drupaceous seeds {e.
ff.
in P/inica), which are doubtless devoured 
by birds ; and, after digestion of the pulpy testa, the body of the seed, 
will) the hard tegnien, is evacuated, and dissemination occurs.
Or, again, 
such a drupe as the Apple, where the induriition of the endocarp is slight, 
we have the fruit behaving as a berry, and dissemination taking place by 
means of the seeds.
Some botanists may, perhaps, be surprised to note the omission of the 
terms Siliqua and Silicnla, so universally employed to designate the fruits 
of CruciferfB.
A little reflection, however, is sufficient to make it evident 
that, if distinctions so triHing in character as those which separate these 
fruits from other valvular capsules were co;isistently carried out in practice, 
the terminology would become altogether intolerable.
A similar argu- 
ment may be adduced in favour of the suggestion made in the foregoing 
table, as to the propriety of devising some common term which will 
supersede those of Follicle and Letjiiine.

Since the publication of the fifth volume of the ' English Flora' in 1836 
— the work of the Uev. M.
J. Berkeley, which comprehended all the species 
that had been discovered in this country up to that time, and in which 
the characters, together with synonyms and references to figures, were of 
the most complete kind, — little lias been done, in a systematic wav to 
enable botanists of moderate means to pursue the study of mycoloo-y.
Without access to libraries such as that of Kew or the British Museum, 
a considerable outlay has been necessary to obtain the books containiuo- 
the requisite information ; many of these are very scarce, and the subjects 
treated of ordy in detached papers in the transactions of the learned socie- 
ties of our own or other countries, and therefore inaccessible to the o-eue- 
rality of students.
The only work comprising all the species indigenous 
to Great Britain that has appeared since tiiat time, viz.
the ' Outlines of 
British Kungology,' by the author of the first-named work, was published 
in 1860, but it was so restricted by the publishers as to be of service 
only to those who possessed the works of Fries and other writers, so far 
as the more minute forms are concerned, since it contained specific cha- 
racters of the larger species only, with short descriptions of the fiimilies, 
orders, and genera, accompanied by a list of the remaining species.
During the eleven years that have elapsed since that period, numerous 
additions have been made to our Flora by a constantly increasing number 
of observers.
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we can now an- 
NEW PUBLICATIONS.
313 
nouiice the completion of the ' Handbook of l^ritish Fungi.' by Mr. M.
C. Cooke, tlie well-known vvritei* on the subject, in the issue of the second 
volume of his work.
The author has deterred his introductory matter for 
the present, as the dimensions of the work have alrc^ady far exceeded what 
was originally intended ; we think he has also wisely avoided " encumber- 
ing his pages with a multitude of new generic names, often fanciful, sel- 
dom necessary, and which may, at best, be regarded as transitional." In 
the primary divisions of the Hyraenomycetes he has adopted the latest 
views of Fries, witii the additions and analytical key of Mr. W.
G. Smith, 
first published in tiiis Journal, which will be found of great use in refer- 
ring each species to its proper position.
In characterizing the families, 
orders, and genera, Mr. Cooke has combined the opinions of the Swedish 
mycologist, contained in the ' Monographia Hymenomycetum Suecise,' 
with those of the author of the Outlines, with the addition of synonyms 
and references to figures ; and it may be here mentioned that the labour 
of those commencing the study of mycology will be considerably lessened 
by the characteristic woodcuts of each genus executed, we believe, ex- 
pressly for the work by Mr. W.
G. Smith, to whom the author is also 
indebted for laimerous original observations.
Another point now become 
essential to a correct description of a species has not been neglected by 
Mr. Cooke, viz.
the measurements of spores, these he has given, wherever 
they were attainable, as well in fractions of an English inch as in milli- 
metres, that again saving considerable time to the student in comparing 
specimens with French descriptions.
The Myxogasters are considered to 
belong to the fungi, agreeably to the views of most botanists, and the 
Outlines followed in their arrangement.
The work before us begins at 
this point to attain an increased value, as no specitic characters of the 
subsequent species, except of a few of the larger Elvellacei, are given in 
the Outlines.
The Splueroncmei are generally described as autonomous 
species, although doubts of their being truly such are thrown out; the 
state of our knowledge of these plants is not, however, sufficient to enable 
us, with few exceptions, to refer them to other genera with any degree of 
certainty.
The author has here adopted the sound advice of Tulasne : — 
" Multi propterea tutiorem viam sequentur f|ui, deticiente debitae, longse 
scilicet, opportuiise et assiduse observationis facultate, ea qupe seorsa seu 
discreta viderint, seorsim etiara, sicuti hactenus mos est, describent, nee 
dubia incertaque tentabunt conjugia." Favourable opportunities, time at 
our disposal, patient and repeated observations at various periods of the 
year, are requisite to form a correct opinion on these ol)scure affinities.
But there can be little doubt that if any of these presumed genera are 
merely various modes of fruiting of one and the same species, the rule 
will hold good of them all, however difficult their identification may be.
With regard to the Mucedines and Mucorini, it may be sufficient to state 
that the author follows the same course as with the former Orders, not 
entering on controverted questions.
He has, however, made a step in 
advance by introducing the Saprolcgniea?
provisionally amongst fungi.
In the ascigerous section, Elvellacei, Tuberacei, etc., all the more receht 
information is given, which may be asserted with equal truth of the 
Sphicriacei, although it does not appear why the secondary forms of fruit, 
as described by Tidasnc, are passed over in silence, as in the genera Ustu- 
lina, Nuuinnilaria, Entypa, etc., nor why certain forms are attributed to 
more tiian one perfect species, as where llciidcrtiuiiiu iiuli/ri/atlx is referred 
31-t PKOCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
to Diatrype lanciformis, p.
436, and to Massaria Argus, at p.
844, it is an 
instance where Tulasne's advice might be of service.
In this extensive 
Order, containing more than 30 genera and nearly 500 species, no attain- 
able information had need be neglected, nor anything introdnced that may 
tend to embarrass.
Of the labonrs of other writers in this section of the 
fungi, copions use has been made, references to such papers as those of 
Mr. Currey in the Linnean Transactions are invaluable in a tribe where 
such distinctive characters may be found in the size and forms of the spo- 
ridia, and where access to authentic specimens is so difficult of attainment, 
very few herbaria in this country probably possessing the ' Scleroraycetes 
Suecise' of Fries.
With all this amount of matter, and the numerous 
illustrations and copious index, contained in the two volumes before us, 
the price to subsciibers is only IDs. 6rf., an amount very inadequate to 
cover the time and labour necessarily bestowed upon them, nor at all 
commensurate with the intrinsic value of the work.
No one desirous of 
undertaking the study of mycology need now be deterred by the cost of 
books, or the dithculty of mastering the great divisions of the subject, 
the illustrations being quite sufficient to convey a general notion to the 
mere tyro.
It is to be hoped that Mr. Cooke's work will find a place in 
every botanical library, and meet with the general appreciation among 
scientific men that it so richly deserves.

"On the Flora of Greenland," by Dr. Robert Brown.
This paper con- 
sisted of (1.) A statement of the collection of Greenland plants from 
which our knowledge of the flora is derived, such as the collections of 
Vahl, Rink, Holboil, Obick (catalogued by Lange), his own collections 
in 1861 and 1867, the collections of the surgeons of whalers, etc.
(2.) The results therefrom derived.
The whole number of the Pha- 
nerogamia and Ferns is about 324 species and marked varieties.
From 
a study of its flora from all available sources, he could only confirm 
and extend Dr. Hooker's conclusions from a study of the whole Arctic 
phyto-geography.
It had many peculiarities, namely, the identity of 
the Greenland and Lapponian floras, the paucity of species, etc.
Enter- 
ing upon a consideration of Mr. Darwin's view, he considered that 
his doctrine of the Scandinavian flora being driven into all latitudes 
during the glacial period was abundantly confirmed.
Discussing the 
subject of the transporting agents employed in disseminating Green- 
land plants, Dr. Brown considered that icebergs had but a small share 
in this work, for even allowing that they conveyed a considerable 
quantity of seeds in moraine, this moraine was in almost every case 
capsized into the sea and never reached the land.
Migratory land birds 
had nuich more to do with it, and the winds no doubt carried the spores 
of Cryptogamia as well as the heavier seeds of Phanerogamia long dis- 
tances.
Speaking of the decrease of the species according to latitude, it

was mentioned that in Smith's Sound only fifty-two species were found.
Cyperacea was the largest Order.
Plants sometimes reached under fa- 
vourable circumstances as high as -iOOO ft., though more frequently 
2000 was the limit.

There was no connection between the present and pre- 
existing floras of Greenland.
The Cryptogamic plants were much less 
kuoAvn. Already 268 species of Lichens were described from Greenland, 
though many more were vet to be discovered, as Lauder Lindsay had 
found upwards of twenty species entirely new to science in his collection 
(Linn.
Trans.
1870).
UiiibUlcnria had the effect of giving an aspect to 
the scenery, but Lecidea had the largest number of species, viz., sixty- 
three.
The Mosses known from Greenland were not many.
Prof.
Lawson, 
of Oxford, only found between forty and fifty species in Dr. Brown's 
collection, though doubtless many more were yet to be discovered.
Only 
twenty-six Hepatlca were yet known from Greenland.
Tlie Al(/ft; described, 
number between forty and fifty, and left room for many new discoveries.
The Fungi were few and the DiatoraacecB were little known.
Prof.
Dickie remarked with regard to the Algrp, they were abundant not in 
species but in individuals.
DiatomacetB abounded; they largely composed 
a material obtained from cracks in the ice and resembling bread soaked in 
water, and they had also been obtained from the stomachs of moUusca.
The land flora consisted of plants of the Scandinavian type, and these 
it was well known had the widest range of all plants.
Prof.
Lawson 
thought that from birds sitting on icebergs there might be a greater 
deposit upon them ; but the birds chiefly fed on fishes and would not 
necessarily bring seeds.
The plants carried by icebergs would be chiefly 
Mosses and lower plants : these fall on glaciers from adjacent rocks and ulti- 
mately reach icebergs.
The space examined in Greenland had been very 
small.
The 270 plants chiefly represented a coast flora ; of the vegetation 
of the interior, nothing was known.
The Mosses from Greenland, princi- 
pally belonging to the genus Bn/um, were all common English forms.
The collection was probably very imperfect.
Prof.
Thiselton Dyer said 
that more exact information as to the carrying power of icebergs was 
nnich to be desired.
Darwin stated that they had been known to carry 
brushwood (' Origin of Species,' 4th edition, p.
432), but he had never 
been able to ascertain the authority on which this statement rested.
Mr. Birkbeck Nevins had never seen in Hudson's Straits either land- 
birds.
Mosses, or plants upon icebergs.
Dr. Brown, in reply, said that 
the transporting power of bergs had been much exaggerated.
For 
flowering plants it was certainly small ; as to Cryptogams it Avas different, 
since their spores might be carried considerable distances bv the wind.
Birds were the chief transporting agents of Arctic plants, all the passerine 
birds of Greenland were birds of passage.
Prof.
A. Dickson, " Sufo-es- 
tions on Fruit Classification " [printed in full at p.
309], Prof.
Dickie 
objected to the treatment of drupes in the paper.
The shallow groove in 
the fruits of the Plum, etc., was a very important point.
Prof.
Balfour 
liked the primary divisions j)roposed.
He was cpiite prepared to accept 
some improvement, but he thought that after all Professor Dickson had 
not reduced the nund)er of names very materially.
Prof.
Thiselton 
Dyer pointed out that fruit classifications had to be judged from two 
points of view.
Writers on structural botany naturally desired a symme- 
trical classification ; on the other, systematists would not use a cninbrous 
316 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
nomenclature.
What was wanted was a comproniisp, a set of terms which 
would admit of satisfactory definition from a structural point of view, and 
which would be of practical use to those who described plants.
It was 
absurd to go on loading our text-books with mere terms which taught 
nothing, and were never used.
Prof.
Lawson thought that all terms 
found in books ought to be taught to students!
If this were not done, 
they would be utterly at a loss when they came upon a term which had 
never been explained to them.
Prof.
Perceval Wright said that 
manuals of botany were regarded as too little subject to change.
They 
were very much open to improvement.
J. Birkbeck Nevins, " On tlie 
Development of the Vascular Tissue in Flowering Plants." Neil 
Stewart, " An Inquiry into the Function of Colour in Plants, or into its 
Relationship to the Manner of their Illumination during Different Stages 
of their Development." The author read, this paper, which was very 
long, in abstract.
It was difficult to obtain a clear conception of his 
views.
He was himself in doubt as to "whether he was deluded by a 
hobby, or hovering on the dawn of a new botanical philosophy." His 
notion seemed to be that the colour (and form) of flowers was controlled 
by advantage of the n flections of light from one part to another.
Dr. li.
Bi-own, '' On the Distribution of the Flora of Xorth-west America." 
The chief point brought out in this paper was that, instead of one homo- 
geneous flora to the north of Mexico and to the west of the Rocky Moun- 
tains, there were several.
The chief of these were, (I.) The flora to the 
west of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Mountains, and (2.) the flora to 
the east of that range and between it and the Rocky Mountains.
There 
were various subdivisions, but these two were the chief ones.
Then 
there was the Arctic flora by the shores of the Arctic Sea, and until you 
<;ame south of ihe range of mountains which runs up the peninsula of 
Aliask, the Athabascan, or flora of the country to the immediate east of 
the Rocky Mountains, maintained its ground.
There was an alpine floi-a 
of a similar nature on the Rocky and Cascade Mountains, though slightly 
varying according to the latitude.
The whole north-west American is 
peculiar, and, as Oersted, of Copenhagen, pointed out, of a character 
almost insular.
He diftered from Dr. Asa Gray in thinking that there 
were few .Japanese elements in the North-west American flora.

— Colonel Yule, C.B., pre- 
sided.
— Captain Miles, "On the Somali Coast." The Exports from 
Bunder Murayah are frankincense, gum arable, ' mulig,' indigo, and mats.
Indigo grows wild, and is sent to Moculla and Shehcr, where there is a 
great demand for it.
The mats are made almost exclusively of the 'ow' 
or leaf of the Donm {Hyphcene) and wild Date Palms, the latter being 
preferred ; they are dyed of two colours only, red and black ; the red dye 
is a mixture of ashes, 'fooah,' saltpetre, and camel's dung, but they are 
acquainted with several plants that produce a red dye.
' Mulig,' or as 
the Somal call it ' gero,' the fruit of the Doura Palm, is a nut with a hard 
and thick rind ; it is cut in half, dried, and strung for export.
The 
kernel is perfectly insipid, and requires an immense deal of mastication ; 
it has nothing to recommend it, but is much eaten by the natives as a

restorative.
Asclepias, Senna, and Aloe plants grow abiuulaiitly, but 
their medicinal and fibrous uses are unknown to the natives.
The most 
remarkable products of this country are its gums and resins.
Gum 
arable, tragaeanth, myrrh, and many others are produced in abundance ; 
and in no other country, except sparsely on the opposite coast of Arabia, 
does the Olibanura or Frankincense tree exist.
The Somal divide gum 
into two classes — sweet and bitter; and to the former belong gum arable, 
mastic, 'luban,' mayeti, etc., and to the latter myrrh and ' hodthai.' 
There are, at least, three species of Acacia, producing the sumugh or 
gum arable, and they are all very abundant ; the bark is cut three times 
only by the natives for the gum to exude ; if cut more frequently the tree 
dies.
I was told that the tree is cut only in this and the neighbouring 
province of Wursum-Galli ; in the west the gum is allowed to exude 
naturally.
The ' hodthai ' is a gum of peculiar quality ; the tree is a 
thorny Acacia, not unlike the ' babool,' but has a thorny bark.
The 
gum is not exported, and the only use it is put to, is by men, to whiten 
their shields, and by women to cleanse their hair.
The tree producing 
the Olibanura or Frankincense, which is called by the Somal ' Beyu,' grows 
only on the limestone ranges of this and the opposite coast.
There are 
four different species of the tree, producing two different kinds of gum, 
bedwi or sheheri the best, and mayeti.
Numbers of the Soinfd go across 
to Hadhramaut.
for the purpose of gathering the frankincense, paying the 
Arab tribes for the privilege, the latter never attempting to collect it them- 
selves.
The Somalies never settle there, selling the gum at Moculla and 
Sheher, until they have amassed a competence.
Tlie Arab ' luban ' is 
considered inferior to the African, which is termed ' asti ' by the Aral)s ; 
probably the tree was imported into Arabia with the Myrrh-tree 
in very remote times.
The mayeti is exported chiefly to Jiddah and 
the Yemen ports ; the bedwi goes to Bombay for exportation into 
Europe.
The season for gathering the gum lasts for four months — 
from May to September; the trees may be gashed any number of 
times without injury ; but, unless rain falls soon after, the tree withers 
and dies.
The gum is gathered fifteen days after the tree is cut, and it 
then ceases to exude, and the bark, which heals rapidly, is again gashed.
The trees though growing wild are carefully watched by the Somal, and in 
some cases I am told they plant and propagate saplings in their fields; 
but this laudalde custom by which their wealth might be decupled is too 
laborious to be universally followed.
Mr. D.
Hanbm-y ol)served that, 
as stated by Captain Miles, in ancient times frankincense was held to 
come from Arabia and froui the adjacent coast of Africa ; but with 
what almost seemed to be an unaccountable confusion, but which existed 
in all the books that had appeared on the subject in the latter part of 
the last century, and iu the whole of the present up till within the 
last few years, they were taught to believe that frankincense was a pro- 
duct of India.
It was very (lesiral)le to have information on that highly 
iiit.erestiug subject.
As to the different species of Gum-trees, their infor- 
mation was very poor ; and with respect to myirli, it was even more so.
Much had been written as to Cinnamon, early authors holding that it was 
a product of Africa and .\ral)ia.
It was a very nice question, which re- 
quired elucidation, whether the Cinnamon mentioned in Holy Writ was 
the prorluct of Africa and Araliia, or whether it was merely carried thither 
from India, or froui the still remoter regions of Siam and China by w,iy

of commerce, and whether in that way the idea was promulgated that it 
was produced in the laud and districts from which it was shipped, by way 
of the lied Sea to Europe.
In answer to a question Mr. Haubiiry further 
mentioned that the common name in India of Cinnamon — ' Dar-Chiui' — 
seemed to indicate that it was originally obtained from China (Cassia), 
and not from Ceylon.
Cinnamon and Cassia were anciently hardly dis- 
tinguished.
Cinnamon was indigenous to Ceylon, but the form which 
yielded the bark was a cultivated one.

occurs in groves on little elevations in wide plauis, which were once possi- 
bly lakes.
The trees of each group are of about the saine age, the oldest 
being highest up the country.
It is possible that the seeds of the Baobab 
only germinate just a little above the level of the water.
As the country 
became drained, each elevation, on its emergence, would be stocked with 
the Baobab by fruits floating down from the older and higher groves.
Mr. Chapman measured one tree, 155 feet in circumference.

Dr. Cleghorn said that, like everything 
else done by Dr. Joseph Hooker, this investigation had been carefully and 
thoroughly carried out, and a great desideratum of botanical knowledge 
had been obtained.
The absence of Primroses, Gentians, and Anemones 
was most remarkable.
The observation on the exhausted condition of the 
forests was also noteworthy.

Mr. Robert Cross, who has been collecting seeds and plants for the Go- 
vernment East India plantations, has once more gone to South America, 
this time, on his own account, to gather Chinchona bark as a commercial 
speculation.
It would seem a pity that the services of so enterprising 
and daring a traveller should be lost to the East India plantations.
iSurely some remunerative situation could be found for one who has 
gathered, at the peril of his health and life, so much information invalu- 
able to the cultivator.
We are glad to see that the East India Office has 
published Mr. Cross's "Report on the Collecting of Seeds and Plants of 
the Chinchonas of Pitayo ; "(printed for H.M. Stationery Office, 1871.
8vo.
52 pp., with three plates), from which it appears that the splendid 
('hinchona forests of Pitayo are fast disappearing.
Little of this bai-k 
goes to England, the greater quantity to France and Germany, especiallv 
to France, " whose agents have nearly demolished forests which, if pro- 
perly managed, would iiave paid off' tiie national debt of New (Jranada." 
Mr. Cross is of opinion that the bark sold in England as Pitayo, " and 
for eigliteen-peuce a pound," does not come from the Pitayo district, as 
genuine Fitayo fetches nearly a shilling per pound on the spot.
The 
three plates accompanying the report represent hieroglyphics, resembling 
those discovered by Seemann in Veraguas, and showing that the district 
was inhabited at a very early period.
On August 20th, at the advanced age of eighty-four, died James De 
Carle Sowerby, the eldest son of James Sowerby, well-known as the artist 
of the original figures of ' English Botany,' published in the years from 
1790-1814.
In his earlier years the late Mr. Sowerby was a devoted 
mineralogist, and especially studied the chemistry of minerals, the results 
of his investigations being published in his father's ' British Mineralogv ' 
and ' Exotic Mineralogy.' He afterwards took up the subject of fossil 
conchology, and contributed various papers to the Royal, Linnciin, and 
Geological Societies: from the last he received in 1840 the " Wollaston 
jMind " in aid of his studies.
To the general public, however, he was

best known from his connection witli the Eoynl Botanic Society.
When 
this was founded in 1839 Mr. Sowerby was appointed secretary, and he 
held tlie office till within a year or two of his death.
He strove to render 
the Gardens usefvd as well as attractive; and teachers of botany in the 
medical schools of London have good reason to be orateful to him for tlie 
attention he paid to their wants, the main snpply of illustiative specimens 
being derived from the Eegent's Park Gardens.
Mr. Sowerby inherited 
his father's artistic skill, and it is to his pencil that we owe most of the 
plates of the ' Supplement to English Botany.' He also wrote a few of 
the descriptions in vols.
i. and ii.
When this Avas commenced in 1829, 
Mr. Sowerby was connected with his brother, Mr. C.
E. Sowerby, in the 
proprietorship.
The death of the latter in IS-tS brought the third volume 
to a premature close, but in conjunction with the late Mr.

\V.
Salter, 
Mr. Sowerby brought out volume iv.
and a fragment (six numbers) of

The original drawings of all these plates, with the exception of those of 
the fifth volume, were in 1862 secured for the Botanical Department of the 
Britisii Museum, which already possessed the drawings made for the 
original edition of ' English Botany,' by James Sowerby.
A great desideratum is shortly to be supplied.
Considerable progress 
has, we hear, been made in the printing of a second edition of Pritzel's 
indispensable 'Thesaurus Literaturae Botanicse,' now twenty years old.
The vacancjf in the Botanical Department of the Britisii Museum, 
caused by the promotion of Mr. Carruthers, has been filled by the ap- 
pointment of Mr. James Britten, late assistant in the Royal Herbarium, 
Kew.
We direct our readers' attention to the ' Herbier de la Flore Francaise,' 
by MM.
Cusin and Aiisberque, a magnificent work, illustrated with folio 
plates by a process of nature-printing.
Seven volumes are printed, and 
it is expected that thirteen more will be required to complete the book.
Mr. Hardwicke, 192, Piccadilly, the agent in this country, has copies of 
the published volumes, and will take subscribers' names.
Dr. Bretschneider, Physician to the Russian Legation at Pekin, has 
reprinted as a separate pamphlet his papers in the ' Christian Recorder ' 
(a missionary journal) " On the Study and A^alue of Chinese Botanical 
Works." Though the author modestly says that he is neitlier a botanist 
nor a sinologue, his papers contain much valuable material for a history 
of the officinal and economic plants of China.
The pamphlet is illustrated 
with facsimiles of eight rough but characteristic Cliinese woodcuts from 
the Chi-wu-miug-shi-tii-kao, the most recent Chinese botanical treatise; a 
list of sixty-one books on the subject is added.
The garden of the Royal Horticultural Society at Ciiiswick, which it 
was feared would have to be entirely given iip on the expiration of the 
lease, is to be maintained, though in a much contracted form.
Only 
about one-third of the grounds are retained, including all the fruit-houses ; 
the fine Arboretum, including many probably almost unique trees, and 
the wilderness have been given up.
The portion now retained will no 
doubt be more satisfactorily kept up, the whole garden being beyond the 
Society's powers of support.

thp: botanical history of angus.
By Mr. Robert Brown.
{A Paper read before the Edinburgh Natural History Society on 1%th January, 1702.) 
[This paper, which has never been printed, is of considerable vaUie in 
itself, and will be read with the interest which always attaches to the 
early efforts of great men.
Robert Brown was born on December 21st, 
1773, so that he was but a little over ei<?hteen when he read this essay.
It is probable that it was his first contribution to botanical science, and 
that it is the paper allude<:l to in the obituary notice in the Proceedings 
of the Linnean Society (unhappily the only life we possess of the 
greatest of modern botanists), an addition to Lightfoot's ' Flora Scotica,' 
read in 1791.
The excursion in Angus, which " did not exceed a fort- 
nigiit," must have been made in that or a previous year.
At this period 
Dr. Withering's ' Botanical Arrangement ' — the second, and perhaps best, 
edition of which was completed in 1787 (except the ' Cryptogams,' which 
appeared in 1792) — was altogether the foremost text-book on British 
botany ,- and young Brown must be considered fortunate in having, soon 
after reading this paper, become a correspondent of the careful and 
excellent author.
In the third edition (1796) we find the assistance of 
" Mr. Brown, surgeon, Edinburgh," acknowledged in the preface ; and 
in the body of the book are a good many Scotch localities contributed by 
him, some being the same as those in this paper.
We have been careful 
to print the communication just as it exists in the MS.
volume of the 
Transactions of the Natural History Society, where it was found by Mr.
Carruthers in August last.] 
Mr. President, — In the following pages I do not pretend to give a full 
account of the vegetable productions of the county of Angus ; but what I 
propose is only to enumerate some of its rarest plants, which I either met 
with myself or with regard to which 1 received credible iidbrmation.
Before, however, entering upon this subject, it may not be improper 
brieJly to point out the boundaries of this county and its relative situation 
with respect to other parts of Scotland.
Aiigusshire, therefore, is bounded 
on the soidh by the Prith of Tay, which divides it from the county 
of Fife ; on the east by the German Ocean ; on the north it is sepa- 
rated from the county of Mearns by the river North Enk, and on the 
west it is bounded by part of Perthshire and of the Grampian Moun- 
tains, many of which it includes.
To have minutely examined this 
tract of country, no less extensive than diversified in external appear- 
ance, would have required a length of time far greater than what [ 
had to bestow on such an investigation; and when it is considered that 
the time I remained in that country did not exceed a fortnight, it will 
perhaps be thought presuming to attempt even a sketch of its botanicUl 
history.
Conscious, therefore, of the numerous defects necessarily arising 
from this circumstance, I have not here proposed giving a full catalogue 
of its vegetable productions.
Confining myself, as was before remarked, 
to those rarer plants only, which I can, either from an actual examination 
vol..

[novemuer 1, 1871.] Y 
322 THE BOTANICAL HISTORY OF ANGUS.
or aiitliority in most cases unquestionable, safely mention as natives of 
Annus.
Before, however, we enter upon the investigation of the particular 
objects here to be treated of, it may not be amiss to observe that in 
different parts of this, as well as of every other country, even in situations 
almost pel fectly similar, the plants produced are by no means tlie same ; 
nor do we find that those which are common in one part of this kingdom 
are equally so in another.
It may not be improper to illustrate this by a 
few examples relative to the present case.
Ilypi^ricum pidcltrum is far 
from being frequent iu this neighbourhood, but it grows in most parts of 
Angus in the greatest profusion.
Single specimens of the Fiicns esculentus 
or F.
piiinatifidiis can hardly be met vvith on the seashores of this part of 
the kingdom.
Both these plants, however, are so plentiful in the county 
alluded to, that the collecting and selling of them, especially of the former, 
aft'ord even an almost constant employment for a particular class of the 
poorer sort of people.
Befoi-e prosecuting my subject I have only further to remark, that 
besides merely mentioning the plants as they occur, I shall, when it 
appears requisite, make a few observations on those whose Linnrean 
names do not yet seem sufficiently determined ; not that in such cases I 
can pretend altogether to clear up the ambiguity, but principally with a^ 
view to the remarks of the ingenious members of this Society.
I shall 
likewise add a few observations on such ]dants as are inserted in the 
' Flora Scotica,' either from dubious authority or where no particular 
place of growth is mentioned.
I shall now proceed, therefore, to the enumeration proposed, taking tlie 
plants as tliey stand in the Liinifean system ; beginning with the Utrkn- 
laria minor, which grows plentifully in pools of stagnant water near 
Forfar.
In other parts of Scotland this plant is very rarely to be met 
vvith ; the oidy place mentioned in the ' Flora Seotica ' is some peat pits 
near Kirkmicliael in Dumfriesslnre.
Schcenns Mcirhcus, which is not mentioned in the ' Flora Scotica,' grows 
in marshy ground north-east from Forfar.
The spot in which it grows 
was formerly a small loch, which has lately been drained for the sake of 
its marie, and since that period the plant has never been observed in 
flower, but is in a very weak state.
Scirpiis sylvaticns is likewise to be met with in this country in ground 
which is overflowed in the winter betwixt Brechin and Montrose.
Kriophomiu ulpinum, a plant hitherto unknown as a native of Britain, 
I observed near the same place with the ScJiceniis MariscMS.
Within a 
mile of this p'are I likewise observed a species of Agrostis, which appeared 
cousiderably iliflVrent from any of those commonly described as of British 
growth.
It was then late in the season, and I did not find more than one 
specimen in flower.
Afterwards, on compiring it with some grasses 
lately sent to the Botanic Garden here by Mr. Curtis, I found it exactly 
corresponding to his Agrostis tennifoUa. As, before I could do this, it 
was necessarily much later in the season, the plants were not in flower ; 
but by the shape of the leaves from which the specific name feiiiiifolia has 
very aptly been taken, I coukl easily see the plants were jierfectly similar.
But till Mr. Cnrtis's plants flower, nothing can be said with certainty on 
the subject.
At present I shall only add that, as I am very little ac- 
quainted with the ' Flora Londinensis,' I am not certain whether or not 
Mr. Curtis has as yet published any observations on this species.
THE BOTANICAL HISTORY OF ANGUS.
323 
Bfuuuis (seculiiiiis grows in some ccjnificlds several miles south Iroiii 
Forfar.
In the 'Appendix to the Flora Scotica ' it was mentioned to 
grow in similar situations behind the Botanic Garden, but I hardly think 
it will be found there now.
Scabiosa C'o/Mwifln'fir was inserted in the ' Flora Scotica' on the authority 
of Sibbald, but no place of growth mentioned.
It has been observed 
within a mile of Arbroath, in dry pastures.
Qallnm erectum, of Hudson, I was informed, had been found near 
Brechin, but the information cannot be altogether depended upon, as I 
saw no specimens.
I thought, however, as it is not mentioned by Mr.
Lightfoot, that this information was worthy of notice.
Lys'wiachia thyrvflora grows in marshy ground beside the Schoeuiis 
Marinciis, and likewise in a similar situation betwixt Montrose and lire- 
chin.
This plant was not found by Mr. Liglitfoot, nor has it, I believe, 
been observed by later travellers in North Britain.
Eryiigiiim murilimiim, or Sea Holly, grows plentifully on the sandy 
beach near Montrose, and in many other like situations on the coast.
Ligiisticum scoticnm was likewise observed, though very sparingly, on 
the coast betwixt Montrose and Arbroath.
Slum angustifolium I observed in ditches about Forfar.
I do not men- 
tion this plant altogether on account of its scarcity, but because it has 
given rise to a mistake in the ' Flora Scotica.' This species itself is in- 
serted in that work, and a description added which is very characteristic.
But, on the authority of Mr. Yalden, the S.
latifulium is mentioned in 
the appendix as a native of Scotland, and the only place of growth assigned 
is the King's Park.
That tlie plant here called S.
latifoUum is nothing 
else than the real S.
augnstlfoHiim there can be little doubt, for Mr.
Yalden, in a catalogue which he has given of the plants in the King's 
Park, and which is published in the end of Mr. Liglitfoot's work, men- 
tions the S.
latifollani, although it is well known that the S.
anrjustifulinm 
grows plentifully in that place, and, as far as I have observed, no other 
species of this genus.
Cicuta virom is very plentiful in the ditches about Forfar, and in other 
parts of the country ; but, although it is thus frequent, I never yet heard 
of its having been the cause of any fatal accident, although one of the most 
virulent poisons of the vegetable kingdom.
In other parts of Britain it 
is providentially very scarce.
Linum Radiuliim I likewise observed in wet ground in several parts of 
the country.
Drosei-a rotnndifolia is a plant not unfrecpiently to be met with on 
marshy ground.
According to Mr. Lightfoot, the longifolia is equally 
common in Scotland, but this is far from being really the case.
It has 
of late been asserted that the leaves of the Dronera have the power, when 
a small body is applied to their upper surface, of contracting and enclosing 
the substance so applied, by this means in many cases proving a trap to 
those insects which happc^n to light upon them.
The examination of this 
curious fact is certainly well worth the attention of the naturalist.
In 
the second edition of Withering's ' Botanical Arrangement,' it is alleged 
that this phenomenon was observed immediately to follow the application 
of the substance.
But it appears I'rom works of a late German author 
that several hours generally elapseil before the leaf was completely folded 
together.
The same author observes that when an insect is placed u|)ou a 
Y 2 
324' THE BOTANICAL HISTORY OF ANGUS.
leaf it naturally endeavours to escape, but is prevented by the viscid juice 
which is secreted by the long hairs on its upper surface.
In a short 
time these hairs begin to be bent inwards, and "radually clasp the insect, 
which about this time is found dead, not so much in all probability from 
the pressure of the hairs, which cannot be great, but rather from the 
nature of the fluid which they exude.
After the hairs have thus enclosed 
the animal the leaf itself begins to contract, and by very slow degrees at 
last covers its prey.
Although I by no means pretend to deny the fact 
alleged by Dr. Withering, which was related from the actual experiment, 
yet I am rather inclined to give more credit to the German author's 
experiments.
In a few trials which I made myself no contraction fol- 
lowed after a very considerable time, nor did I at all observe it.
But it 
must be owned that as these w ere made with a pin instead of an insect, I 
cannot pretend to contradict the fact, but rather to blame the mode in 
which the trials w'ere made.
For it is well known to every one who has 
seen this plant in the growing state thai many of its leaves are generally 
folded, and if these are opened there is always found some substance 
enclosed.
If, theiefore, the Drosera is endowed with such a power (and 
there is the strongest reason to believe it is), we will have some difficulty 
in accounting for it on principles merely mechanical.
1 now proceed 
with my enumeration.
J/nicH.s articnlatiis, viviparm, I observed growing plentifully in wet 
ground near Forfar.
In one case I saw the viviparous germen taking 
root, and in several instances these viviparous plants llowered when one 
half inch in height.
AfhiduH Ui:n-iirsi and Epilubium alpinum.
Both grow on many of the 
Grampian Mountains.
DifnithiiH deltoldes I likewise observed in several parts of Angus, and in 
one found a variety of it with a stem not divided as is generally the case, 
but simple, and supporting only one flower.
Is it not probable that this or 
some other variety of the same species is the plant mentioned by Sibbald 
as growing on a hill near Perth, and inserted in the ' Flora Scotica' under 
the name of Bianthus areiiarius ?
To satisfy myself concerning this I 
examined a hill in the vicinity of Perth (whether the same as that meant 
by Sibbald I am uncertain), and actually found the Bianthus deltoides 
and a variety with a white flower.
I apprehend, therefore, that the 
Dlanthus arenarius should be excluded from the ' Flora Scotica.' 
Si/eite amoena, as it has commonly been called by the botanical "\\riters 
of this island, grows plentifully along the coast.
It is, however, very 
difl'ei-cnt from the plant so named by LinntBus, as evidently appears from 
comparing it with tlie specific character and short description which that 
author has given of his plant.
It seems upon the whole very surprising 
that this name should have been applied to a plant so totally different in 
respect of characteristic distinctions, and almost im|)ossil)le to assign any 
reason for such a conduct which has been almost universally adopted in 
this country.
It should, however, appear by the ' Hoi tus Kewensis ' 
that this plant is nothing else than the variety of the Cncuhahis Belieii, 
wdiich grows on the seacoast, mentioned by the older botanical authors.
But that it is more than a variety seems to me perfectly evident, as I 
have seen the plant cultivated without any alteration being produced.
It 
even belongs to a different genus.
But this will serve to show in a 
manner how artificial and with vNhat impropriety the &ilene and Cucubalus

are separated, for in a strict propriety they only constitute along with the 
LycJmis one genus.
But setting asitle this last, it is evident that the two 
former might easily be joined without the least violence to the Liunaeriu 
system.
The Citcnbalus viscosus Avas said to have been found on the coast near 
Montrose, but I suspect the Sileiie nntans has been mistaken for it, as 
is now found to have been the case in England.
The iS".
mUam has, I 
believe, never been found in Scotland, at least it is not mentioned in the 
' Flora Scotica.' 
A species of Arenaria was observed on the Castlehill of Forfar, by Mr, 
Lightfoot, and by him thought to be the A.
laricifolia of Liunseus.
But 
from the figures referred to in the ' Flora Scotica,' it seeius quite a differ- 
ent plant ; but whatever it might have been, it is periiaps now lost to Scot- 
land, as the greater part of the place on which it was said to grow has of 
late been cultivated, and the little that remains in its natural state I ex- 
amined carefully, but without finding this or any such platit.
Sed/tm Telephinm has been observed in some cornfields in tlie northern 
parts of this county.
Sedum anglicum, of Hudson, I observed on rocks near Dundee.
It 
may not here be improper to remark, that there is at least some room to 
suppose this plant the S.
annuum of Linn?eus, as both authors refer to 
the same figure, viz.
that given by Dillenius in Ray's ' Synopsis.' I 
should have been more confident in my assertion had I not observed that 
both plants are mentioned as growing in Kew Gardens.
But I am even 
still inclined to think that some mistake has crept into the work in which 
this is to be seen, or if the plants are really distinct, it is evident that the 
synonyraa have beeu misapplied.
Spergula saginoides grows in sandy ground near Forfar.
This plant 
was called S.
laricina, by Hudson and Lightfoot, and observed by the 
latter in the isle of Bute.
It agrees perfectly well with the specific cha- 
racter either of the one or other of these plants.
Spiraea Filipendula grows on rocky ground near Dundee.
TurrUlH Jdrsuia is likeways to be foiuid on several of the lower hills of 
Angusshire.
I was likeways informed, from good authority, that the 
T. glabra had been found a few miles west from Montrose.
'J'his plant 
has never yet been found in Scotland, and is even very rare in England.
The variety of Erodimn cicntariam, with a white fiower, grows not UU/- 
commou on the seacoast.
Perhaps it may be more than a variety, at least 
if it is only so, tlie differences are permanent and unalterable by cultiva- 
tion.
Although most authors have supposed these to arise from the iw- 
fluence of the sea.
But as I have observed them uncliangeable by cul- 
ture I cannot accede to tliis opinion.
Besides, I have frequently had 
occasion to see plants of this and of the couunon E.
cicnlariiiiii growing 
side by side; and we may add to tins, that the former is known to grow 
in the King's Park, a place which we may safely suppose to be altogether 
removed from the infiuenoe of tiie sea, and it may likewise be observed 
that in the place now mentioned the E.
cicidarliim does not grow.
Upon 
the whole, this plant has certaiidy equal pretensions to a separate specific 
character from the E.
cic/Uariin//, as the; E.
pimpintdli/o/iiim of Mr.
Curtis and others.
Orohiis sylvaticus has been observed in some shady woods near Airly 
Castle.
326 THE BOTANICAL IIJSTORY OF ANGUS.
Astragalus (jlycyphyllus I observed on the coast betwixt Montrose 
and Arbroath.
A species of this genus which Hudson, and after him 
Mr. Lightfoot, have taken for the A.
arennrius, of Linnajus, grows plenti- 
fully along the whole coast.
It is now found to be widely different from that 
plant, but what its proper name should be seems not yet fully determined.
Retzins, in his ' Observaliones Botanicfe,' remarks that it is very nearly 
allied to the Adragalm danicns, but yet seems different.
In the second 
edition of ' Withering's Botanical Arrangement,' this name is given it, 
but with some impropriety, as Uetzius's plant is annual, while the plant 
found in this country is perennial.
In the ' Hortus Kewensis' it has been 
called Jstrar/aliis hypoglottis, but it does by no means altogether corre- 
spond with the specific character which Linn?eus has given to that species.
Considering this diversity of opinion, I should be led to imagine that 
this plant is as yet undescribed, or if at all described, it is certainly but 
id characterized, or distinguished from those to which it is most nearly 
allied.
For it is certain that it very well expresses the specific characters 
of several species of Astragalus.
Trifollum medium grows by the sides of hedges in several parts of Angus.
Concerning this plant likeways there has been a considerable diversity of 
opinion.
In the tirst edition of the ' Flora Anglica' it is called the Trifo- 
Uum medium, the name which it should still retain.
In the second edition 
of the same work, and in the ' Flora Scotica' it has, however, been named 
Trifolium alpestre.
Jacquin, in his ' Flora Austriaca,' has made it a new 
species, giving it the name of Trifoliam Jlexnosum, which is adopted in the 
second edition of ' Withering's Botanical Arrangement.' But in a paper 
wrote by Afzelius, and published in the " Transactions of the Linnean 
Society," it is proved that the plant in question is nothing else than the 
Trifolium medium of Linnaeus.
Ilyuseris rdiuin/a grows in several cornfields about Forfar.
It was in- 
serted in the ' Flora Scotica' on Sibbald's authority, but no place of growth 
mentioned.
I observed likeways a variety of the Carduus Marianus, with leaves 
altogether green, about a mile from Dundee.
Solidago cambrica was observed in the western parts of Angus.
Ac- 
cording to Lightfoot, it is only a variety of Virga-aurea, produced bv the 
particular soil in which it grows.
But since that period cultivation has 
ascertained them specifically distinct.
Doronicum.
Fardalianches grows in shady ground several miles west 
from Montrose.
This plant has never yet been found in England, but 
was observed in Scotland by Mr. Lightfoot in some parts of Annandale; 
as he always found it near buildings, however, he concludes that it has 
probably escaped from gardens.
But in the place which I now mention 
this could not possibly have happened ; and I likeways met with it in 
Perthshire, in a situation which confirms me in this opinion ; and besides, 
it may be remarked, that it is a plant very rarely, if ever, to be found in 
gardens, at least in this age.
I would, therefore, upon the whole, suppose 
this plant to be an original native of this country ; though it may be 
found in situations which may lead to the opinion of its having escaped 
from gardens.
Antliemis tinctoria was a few years ago observed in some cornfields 
al)0ut Forfar, but cannot now be found.
It is not at all mentioned by 
Lightfoot, and is very scarce in iLngland, nor is it in all probability an

Sparfja niiim natans o;ro\vs in pools of stai^nant water a mile east from 
Forfar.
According to Hudson, it is a variety of his Sparganium siwplex, 
bnt there can be little doubt that they are perfectly distinct species.
Ccirex limosa likeways grows near tlie same place.
It is said in the 
'Flora Scotica ' to grow near Crief; but tlie figure referred to by Mr.
Lightfoot evidently represents the Curex panicen, as has already been ob- 
served in the ' Botanical Arrangement.' 
Salix arenaria, of Lightfoot, I observed plentifully in loose sandy 
ground near Montrose.
It is, however, perfectly distinct from the plant 
so called by Linnpeus, as appears from comparing it with that author's 
description.
The S.
arenaria, of Linnseus, is about the height of a man, 
but this plant is only about 10 inches in length and lies close to the 
ground.
As we know the- vast changes produced by a diversity of soil on 
this genus of plants, which iiave never yet ijeen systematically arranged, 
I am not altogether certain whether this plant may not be a variety of the 
S. repens, but I am rather inclined to believe them specifically distinct.
I was informed that the Eqiiisdum hi/ewale grows in the western part 
of Angus.
It is inserted in the ' Flora Scotica,' but no place of growth 
mentioned.
Filnlaria glohuUfera I observed in ground that is overflowed in the 
winter, near Belmont.
It is likeways inserted by Mr. Lightfoot ; but 
neither authority given nor place of growth mentioned.
With these remarks I beg leave to conclude my paper, which, it must be 
owned, in very few parts admits of discussion ; on this account I should 
certainly not have presumed to lay it before the Society, had I not thoutrht 
that the narration of facts of such especially as tend to illustrate in any 
degree the natural history of the country which we inhabit, was perfectly 
consonant with the views of this institution.
[The "authority," several times mentioned in the above essay, is doubt- 
less George Don the elder.
It is probable that he was Kobert Brown's 
companion in some of his excursions.
In Headrick's ' General View of the 
Agriculture of Angus' (1813), Don published an "account of the native 
plants " of the eountry ; Galium erectiiin and Tiirrilis glabra (see above) 
are both included in this list, and he there (p.
20) claims the discovery of 
Eriophorum alpinuw, in 1791, for himself, adding that it was " the first 
and only time it has been found in Great Britain ; he also mentions that 
ScJioenus Mariacun formerly gi'cw there, but does not mention Lysinuichia 
thyrsifora, which Brown collected wilii the others.
This may perhaps in- 
dicate that the two botanists indtipendently found species in tlie same 
year.
In the 15ritish Museum iierbarium, however, are specimens of the 
Eriuphoruin with a ticket in Brown's hand, running thus, " Shell Marie 
Moss of Restcnet, a mile east of Forfar, July, 1 793 .

Brown in com- 
pany with George Hon." This does not tally witii Don's remark about 
"the first and only time;" and it is possiijle that the species was really 
collected by l^rown and Don ii\ company, in 1791, the date " 1793 " on 
Brown's ticket being an accident, (\w.
perhaps to having l)ren written 
long after the date, as the writing ieems to indicate.

FUNGI PARASITIC ON VACCINIUM VITIS-ID.EA.
By W.
T. Thiselton Dyek, B.A., B.Sc.
Certain gall-like bodies occurring on Rhododendron ferrngineum, as to 
the origin of which opinions are somewhat divided, have recently been 
the subject of some discussion in the pages of the 'Gardener's Chronicle.' 
In the number for August 5, tlie Eev. M.
J. Berkeley remarks in reference 
to them, " Mr. Broome has recently sent from Perthshire a thinner but 
similar substance on Vaccbiinm Fitis-Idma covered with a similar bloom.
There is no reason to suppose this is an insect product." 
About the mi(hlle of the same month I met with plants of Facclni/im 
FUis-Idcea, affected in the way described near the Trossachs, and therefore 
in the same county in which Mr. Broome also met with it.
I submitted 
a specimen to Mr. Berkeley, who informed me that it was the result of 
" some species of Ancomyces, probably the same which accompanies or 
causes the gall-like bodies on Rhododendron ferrugbieum.'''' These he had 
already attributed (Gard.
Chron., July 22, p.
944) to an Ascomyces, simi- 
lar to that {A.
deformans, Berk.) which produces blister in Peach-trees.
Happening to show a Vncclnlnm aft'ected in this way to Dr. Ascherson, 
of Berlin, he at once identified it as the effect of a fungus, Exobasidium 
Vacrinii, Woronin, and informed me that it was frequently met with in 
Germany.
In Rabetdiorst's ' Fungi Europeei,' there are authentic speci- 
mens from AVoronin, gathered near St. Petersburg.
The fungus was, 
however, originally described by Fuckel in the ' Botanische Zeitung ' 
for 1861, p.
251, and he figures (tab.
x. t.
7) a portion of the affected 
Vacclniimi, and also the spores.
He gave it the name of Fiisidiiim Vac- 
cirtu, and published specimens with that name in his ' Fungi Khenani ' 
(n.
221).
I learn from Mr. Cooke that the same plant was collected a 
quarter of a century ago by Dr. Greville, and named in MS.
Gylindrosporium 
deformans, but not described.
In 1867, however, Woronin published an ela- 
borate paper, illustrated with beautiful plates, contained in the fourth volume 
of the ' Berichte iiber die Verhaudlungen der Naturforschenden GescUschaft 
zu Freiburg im Breissgau,' (pp.
397-416, t.
v. vi.
vii.) in which 
he states (p.
400) that while entirely agreeing with Fuckel that the dis- 
eased state of the Vaccinium is produced by a parasitic fungus, and not 
through the punctures of insects, he considers the fungus to be alto- 
gether different from a true Fusidium.
He also remarks that while 
Fuckel had met with the fungus on both Facciniam Fitis-Idaa and F.
Myrtillns, he has only succeeded in finding it on the first of these plants.
Woronin represents in his figures the fungus as attacking, besides the 
leaves, the twigs (f.
11, 12, 13), and also the fiowers (f.
16, 17, 18).
The 
parts aft'ected become much hypertrophied, of a pinkish-white colour, and 
with a fiocculeut-looking surface.
In a microscopic examination of a 
section, the intervals between the cells are seen to be densely filled with a 
mycelium from which clavate cells (dasidia) are protruded throiigh the epi- 
dermal layer of the part of the plant aflPected.
These basidia bear the spores 
on short stalks.
As remarked by Woronin (1.
c. p.
412) Exobasidium must 
necessarily be included amongst the Hymenomycetes.
" It stands in the 
same relation to the Hymenomycetes {Basidiomycetes) as the genus Exo- 
ascus \_Ascomyces'\ to the Dlscomycetes (Ascomycetes).* Fuckel only

fi^-iires tlie spores, and did not observe the basic) i;i from which they pro- 
ceed ; he therefore phiced the funi>-iis in a Hyphoinycetal j^enus.
He has, 
however, accepted VVoroniu's observations, and siibstitnted Eaohasidinm 
in his ' Beitrage zur Kenntniss der ilheinischen Pdze,' p.
26, for the name 
nnder wiiich he first described the species, and places it amongst the 
Auriculurini.
The following are all the at present known localities for this plant ; it 
probably only requires looking for to be found in many others.
St.
Petersburg (VVoronin); North Germany, frequent (Rabenhorst, Fungi 
Europsei, sub n.
13S4) ; Khine Valley near Oestrich and Black Forest, 
not far from Friburg (Woronin) ; Scotland, I'erthshire (Broome) ; Balloch- 
buie Forest, Braeinar (E.
M. Parkhurst).
Another fungus, Cnlyptospoi-a Gfjeppertiana, Kuhn (' Hedwigia,' 1869, 
pp.
81, 82), affects the branches of Faccinuim Fitls-Idrea in a very curious 
way ; Rabenhorst remarks that in the neighbourhood of ileichenhall 
(Bavaria), where it is found, the Exobasidiuni, so frequent in North 
Germany, appears to be absent.
This has not been met with in Britain, 
but should be looketl for.
In the Trossachs I also found a species of RJi/jfisina, parasitic upon V.
Vitis-Id^a.
This has not apparently been described, but it is in too im- 
mature a state to admit of determination.
Provisionally it may be re- 
ferred to R.

FURTHEE OBSERVATIONS ON PROTANDRY AND 
PROTOGYNY.
By Alfred W.
Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S.
I have been able to make a few more observations during the past 
summer and winter, on the relative period of the maturing of the nuile 
and female reproductive organs in continuation of those already puijlislied 
in the 'Journal of Botany ' for October, 1870 (Vol. VIII.
p. 315), which 
it may be worth while to record.
The observations were made this year, 
in the latter part of August and early part of September, and in the 
southern counties of Cornwall, Devon, and Surrey.
Not having my pre- 
vious paper at hand, I noted down my observations independently, and 
only compared them subsequently.
liy far the majority of the species 
observed I hnd placed under tlie same head as last year; but the lines 
separating the three groups of Prolandrous, Synacmie, and Protogynous 
ilowcrs (to adopt the nomenclature then suggested) not being an absolute 
one, a few have passed over, as 1 should have ex|)ected would be the case, 
from a group to an adjoining one.
Thus Putodllla Turmeutilla, Riihiis 
frnticosus, D'u/itnlls picrpiiren, and Euphrasia nJficinaHs, set down, in 1870, 
as synacmie, I find noted, in 1871, as jjrotandrous ; while, on the other 
band, Ficia Cracca, Circcea lutetlana, and Convolvulus sepintn, previously 
recorded as protandrous, are now thought to be synacmie.
In two species 
only is there a still wider divergence in my observations than tins — 
Spiraa Ulmaria and Enjlkraa Centaiirium.
The specimens examined of 
these plants last year were distinctly protogynous ; while during the pre- 
sent year, on the other hand, the anthers appeared to reach maturity at a 
decidedly earlier period than the stigmas.
It would be very interesting 
330 ON RUBUS RAMOSUS.
to know whether this discrepancy has been noticed by otlier observers in 
this or in other species.
In E.
Centanrium and its subspecies the stamens 
have a very peculiar habit of not surrounding the pistil, bnt, when they 
are discharging their pollen, the anthers being all collected together on 
one side of the stigmas.
In Sjnr<2a FlUpendida the stamens themselves 
are so arranged as to favour cross-fertilization.
The outer rows of sta- 
mens are matured first, and while they are discharging their pollen, tlie 
inner immature stamens are folded up into a kind of cap, completely 
covering up the stigma and preventing the access of pollen.
The following comprises all the additions I am able to make this year 
to the three lists : — 
Protandrous.
Synacmic.
Protogynous.
Silene maritima.
Hj^ericum pulchrum.
Lonicera Periclymenum.
Spiiaua Filipendula.
Galium palustre.
Plaatago maritima.
Hedera Helix.
Hieracium umbellatum.
Centaurea nigra.
Convolvidus sepium.
Sen'atula tinctoria.
Veronica Chamaidrys.
Solidago Virgaurea.
Prunella vulgaris.
Jasione montana Galeopsis Tetrah.it.
Melampyrum pratense.
Lysimachia nemorum.
In many Composifce belonging to the suborder TubnUflorere, the anthers 
belonging to the perfect bisexual flowers of the disk, while protandrous as 
respects their own pistil, are developed at the same time as the stigmas of 
the female flowers of the ray.
I do not know wdiether it may have been noticed that in several 
species of Couvolviihice't the stamens are normally of unequal lengths, as 
if indicating a structural approximation to the didynamous Orders Lahiatee 
or Scropludarinere .
Jn Convolvulus arvensis the filaments appear to be 
never quite ecpial in length.
I almost invariably find two longer than the 
other three ; the anthers of one of the longest frequently resting on the fork 
of the mature bifid stigma at the time that it is dischargnig its pollen.
In 
C. sepium the filaments are usually of precisely the same length ; but in 
C. tricolor, L.
(C.
minor, Hort.), and Pharbitis Jdspida, Chois.
(^Convolvulus 
major, Hort.), the inecpiality -is quite as strongly marked.
As is likely to 
occur in cultivated plants, the variation is in these cases subject to greater 
irregularity.
In the former species I have sometimes noticed the diffe- 
rence in length to be quite as great as in most didynamous plants; in 
the latter species there appear often to be three distinct lengths, viz.
two 
long, one medium, and two short.
ON RUBUS RAMOSUS, Blox., AN UNDESCRIBED SPECIES 
OF THE NUDICAULIS GROUP.
By T.
R. Archer Briggs.
Through the kindness of Mr. J.
G. Baker, I have recently had the 
opportunity of comparing many of our Plymouth Rubi with named 
examples of foreign specimens in his herbarium from Genevier, Mercier, 
Wirtgen, and other Continental students of the genus.
One comparison 
that I have made has been between tlie Schlickund of Wirtijen and a 
ON RUBUS RAMOSUS.
331 
well-marked English Bramble of the Rhainiiifolii group, that some have 
supposed mig'ht prove identical with it, which has lji;eu named raniosns 
by the Rev. A.
Bloxam, one of the greatest British authorities on Ruhi.
; 
but which seems never to have been described, although common over 
a large tract of country around Plymouth.
I shall, in the first phice, give a description of it, drawn up from a series 
of specimens in my own herbarium, collected in Devon and Cornwall; 
then say in what respects it differs frm SchUrknuii, as represented in 
Mr. Baker's herbarium, as well as from rhnmnifulins, VV.
and N.
; and 
aft(!rwards add a list of the localities where I have seen it growing.
The 
following is the description : — 
Stem erect-arcuate, rooting at the end, round or augidar below, more 
angular towards the top, conspicuously furrowed, often purplish or 
shining in exposure, quite glabrous, or with very few inconspicuous silky 
hairs, no aciculi or setye.
' Prickles scattered, confined to the angles, from 
a long compressed base, strong, sharp, patent or slightly declining.
Leaves 5-nate, or here and there 3-nate and lobed.
Leaflets often con- 
spicuously convex above, not overlapping one another, shining, with a few 
scattered silky hairs, moderately pilose below, and sometimes white-felted 
also, coarfely serrate; terminal leaflet with a stalk at least one-third of 
its length, ovate or obovate, cuspidate, sometimes slightly cordate at the 
base ; intermediate leaflets conspicuously stalked, obovate with narrow 
base, shortly cuspidate ; basal very shortly stalked, narrowly ovate or 
obovate, with very short point ; in the case of a 3-nate leaf the side 
leaflets are much lobed and dilated on the outer side ; midribs with a few 
small hooked prickles ; petioles with slight pubescence ; stipules linear 
with silky hairs.
Flowering shoot angular or furrowed, long, with short, 
not dense, silky hairs.
Prickles few, short, hooked, those on the lower 
part of the shoot very small.
Leaves mostly 3-nate ; terminal leaflet 
obovate, shortly cuspidate, sometimes slightly cordate at the base; other 
leaflets ovate, with the outer sides much dilated and often conspicuously 
dentate or lobed, all irregularly serrate, especially towards the points, 
slightly pilose above, more so below, the upper ones of the panicle often 
white-felted also ; veins prominent.
Panicle sometimes compound, leafy 
below, of moderate length, top rounded, often flexuose or with waved 
rachis below, branches long with from 5 to 3 flowers near the top of 
each, two or three lower branches axillary sparingly pilose, the branches 
covered with ash-coloured felt.
Prickles scattered, declining, sharp, very 
few near the top of the panicle and on the branches.
Sepals ovate, with 
short linear points, rather sparingly pilose on the outside, white- or ashy- 
felted both within and without, rcflexed.
Petals broad, ovate, white or 
very light pink, nearly entire, sometimes notched at the end, claw very 
short.
Filaments white.
Styles dull brownish-pink.
Fruit poor, irre- 
gularly formed, some of the dru|)cs generally proving abortive.
From Sc/dick/imi this plant dirt'ers by being less hairy generally, more 
especially on the flowering shoots, by having no aciculi or setie, which are 
apparent both on the barren stem and panicle of the other, by having 
coarser and less regular serratures to its leaves, and by their points being 
cuspidate rather than acuminate.
Its panicle is more corymbose at the 
top, its sepals broader, and without glands.
Schlicknrui lias the sepals 
renuirkably narrower, and scattered glands appear at the back.
The 
dissimilarity of the two plants in general appearance is greater than the 
333 SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
above-named points of difFerence would seem to imply, and I am not 
disposed to consider them the same thin";; still I may be wrong in this 
opinion, as the specimens before me of ScJilicknmi, are weak and poor, and 
so the comparison has not been altogether a satisfactory one.
From R.
7-Jiamiufolins, W.
and N., it differs in havina; the barren stem 
less angular, leaves often convex above, with more glossy surface, both 
stem and panicle less prickly, especially the branches of the latter, some 
of these being without a single prickle throughout their whole length ; 
also in having the panicle considerably more lax with the flowers at a 
greater distance from the rachis, especially near the top.
The narrower 
base of the terminal leaflet of the leaves of the barren stem affords an 
additional mark for distinguishing it from the very broad cordate-leaved 
form of R.
rhnmnifolins, the R.
cordifoUus of W.
and N.
I have never seen specimens, either fresh or dried, of R.
imbricatus, 
Hort., so have no means of comparing it and R.
r-amosus, but judging 
from Professor Babington's description of it in ' Britisli Riibi' it must be 
very near the latter, although with the leaves imbricate, and tbose of the 
barren stem " opaque and pilose " above, it must differ somewhat from 
it.
R. ramosiis generally grows either in open or partially shaded spots in 
woods, as well as in thickets on their borders, and is much more of a 
woodland plant than is R.
rhamnifolius.
In the tract of country watered by the Plyra I have seen it between 
Stadiscoml)e and Plymstock ; at Derraford, Leigham, in the woods of the 
Plym valley, and other places in the parish of Egg Buckland ; in a lane 
between Elfordleigh and Newnhara Park ; near Bickleigh, etc.
In that drained by the Tavy : — between Knackersknowle aiul Tainerton 
Foliott ; at Warleigh ; Bhixton ; near Maristowe ; Denliam Bridge; 
between Horrabridge and Tavistock, etc.
In that watered by the Yealm and Erme : — at Brixton Tor; Ivy- 
bridge, and in a moist bushy flat below Pen Beacon, on the southern 
border of Dartmoor.
I have also seen it in a wood by the Tamar, close 
to Newbridge, on the Devon side of that river.
In Cornwall I have met 
with it between Pillaton Village and Clapper Bridge, on the Lynlier; as 
well as near Antony, on the road to Sheviocke ; also in this county, at a 
considerable distan(!e from Plymouth, between Looe and Morval ; between 
the former place and Menheniot; and near Probus, only a few miles from 
Truro.

and Asia Minor, which was found growing in abundance in 1865 in a 
cornfield at Ham, near Pichmond, Surrey.

"Right-handed v.
Left-handed.
— The question mooted by Mr.
R. Tucker (Jouru.
Bot. IX.
p. 216), whether a given twining plant 
should be called chxtrorsum or sinistrorsum volubiUs, is, when properly 
looked at, one of such extreme simplicity that it certainly ought not to 
have greatly exercised either mathematicians or botanists.
De Candolle, 
whom Prof.
Clerk Maxwell is stated to have accused of leading astray 
and perverting many uidiappy naturalists in 1827, thus explains the 
matter in that year : — "On determine la direction des tiges volubiles en 
supposant qu'on est soi-mciue place au centre de la spii'ale, et que la tige 
tourne autour de son propre corps " (Organ.
Veg. i.
156); and five years 
later he gave a similar explanation in his ' Fhysiologie Vegetale" (ii.
840).
But the best discussion of the point with which I am acquainted is by 
Schleiden, who states the case clearly and cogently in these words : — " I 
will here very briefly discuss the terms right and left-wound stem, in 
regard to which much confusion prevails.
The natural conception is this : 
the plant is developed from below upward, consequently it ascends; if, 
now, we use the expressions left and right concerning the plant, this can 
only have a meaning when we place ourselves in its position ; but we 
turn to the left in ascending if we have the axis of revolution to the left, 
to the right if we have it to the right.
If we refer it to the course of the 
sun, we can evidently, in regard to our northern hemisphere, only bring 
the southern half of each revolution turned toward the sun into relation 
with its course, and then the right-wound spiral would go with the sun, 
the left-wound against it.
Liniucus strangely used these terms in the 
opposite way, evidently starting from an obscure conception ; and many 
others have followed him therein.
Many have quite reversed the thing, 
called left right and right left, till the whole matter had become confused.
The reference to the course of the sun is, moreover, a very imperfect 
mark.
It appears to me, however, that left and right-Avound cannot well 
be understood in any other way than that which 1 liave given " (Princ.
of 
Sc. Bot.
233).
A screw is called " right-haiuled " in mechanics vvhen a 
line touching the thread rises to the right (Golding Bird and l?rooke, 
Elem.
Nat. Phil.
ed.
5, p.
102) ; but it is obvious that the movement of 
rotation of such a screw is to the left.
If a hollow screw of this kind — 
say a common corkscrew — be blackened inside and then rotated round a 
white stick, the marks it leaves will rise from the left to the right of the 
experimenter, though the motion of the screw itself is to the left.
In the 
same way, a person ascending a spiral staircase, the axis of which is on 
his left-hand, is always turning to the left, but he woidd pass from the 
left to the right of an observer stationed at the circumference of the stair- 
case.
Again, if the horses in a circus are riding round with their off 
legs toward the centre, they are going to the rigiit ; but, whilst traversing 
tiie semicircle nearest a spectator seated outside, they are passing to his 
left.
The error of those who advocate and follow the Linnsean termino- 
logy is that, instead of describing the actual direction taken by the stem, 
they give the apparent one as seen by au observer standing without the

spinil ; thus, in fnct, doing' that with which, as 1 gather from Mr. Tucker's 
note, Prof.
Maxwell rejjroaches his oppotients, viz., representing the re- 
flected image instead of the object.
It is manifestly contrary to reason to 
employ, when speaking of the movements of a living plant, a terminology

Finally, in his

The Marram or Mat Grass, Punmwa aretiaria, R.
et S., is one of 
the best natural sand-binding plants we have.
It is recorded that in the 
latter part of the last century, a large district on the eastern coast of 
Scotland was quite destroyed, and in the course of a few years became a 
complete desert by the advance of the sand from the shore, owing to the 
wanton destruction of the Marram that grew upon it.
On many parts of 
the coast where this grass abounds, the country people make it into mats 
or twist it into ropes.
On some parts of the Welsh coast the peasants 
plait it into mats which are used in churches, or into matting for covering 
rooms.
Johnson relates, in his ' Mercurius Botanicus ' (1641) that, in 
his time the manufacture of ropes, mats and similar articles from the 
Marram was the only handicraft known to the inhabitants of the village 
of New Ang-lesea.

Lycopodium clavatgm.
— One would scarcely expect to find Lycopo- 
dium claratum of much use as an economic plant, but besides the well- 
known application of its inflammable spores for producing artificial light- 
ning, and its use by the chemist for rolling pills in to prevent them 
sticking together, the ])lant itself makes excellent doormats, and for this 
purpose it is largely collected in Sweden.
The mats are very elastic and 
have this recommendation, that when dirty they can be very easily washed, 
upon which they recover their elasticity and dry readily.

Pandanus L'TiLis.
— The Mauritian sugar-bags, which, after being 
emptied of their contents in this country, are bought up, cleansed and 
transformed into small fish-bags or baskets, are mostly made of the leaves 
oi Piindanus utillts.
This species grows abundantly in the Mauritius, but 
owing to the trees being usually cut down every year they assume very 
different forms, frequently throwing out numerous small branches.

sequent upon the culture of the Sugar-cane in Queensland, this species of

raiidann.-i li;is lieen rccoiuiiieiidcd for introduction into some of the nu- 
merous islands bordering the Queenshuid coast.
The manufacture of the 
bags would open a new branch of industry in the colony.
Mr. Hill, the 
director of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, in advocating the cultivation of 
the plant says, " When an active demand shall arise in Queensland for 
sugar-bags we shall find that they are wanting, as also the material for 
their manufacture, unless no time be lost in rearing this valuable tree." 
Though the Mauritian sugar-bags are chiefly made from the leaves of this 
species, those of P.
odoratmiiuiis are also used, and it is not at all impro- 
bable that other species likewise lend their assistance.
The leaves of P.
driipaceits and of several others are used for thatching huts, and their 
stems for posts and supports to buildings.
Indeed, in the Mascarene 
islands which, together with the islands of the Indian Archipelago, are 
the headcjuarters of the Pandani, they are most useful to the natives.

Draba rlpestris, R.
Br., in Ireland.
— Seeing Dr. IVFoore's notice 
of the appearance of Draba rupeslris on Ben Bulben, Sligo, I think 
the following narrative may be of interest.
In August, 1869, I visited 
Ben Bulben, and brought away a number of living plants of various 
species.
Amongst these was a Bltchnmn, gathered on the gentle slope 
of the northern base of the mountain.
On reaching home I potted it, 
and last year I perceived a small plant springing from the soil, wiiich 
I allowed to grow.
In the early spring of this year it commenced to 
flower, and I found that it was a Draba ; and, knowing that D.
in- 
ca)ia was common on the Sligo mountains, I concluded that it must 
be that species.
As its growtii maturefl I fo\md that the pods were 
not twisted, and that it could not be B.
incana, but must be D.
ru- 
pestris, a plant hitherto excluded from the ' Irish Flora,' or recorded 
with a doubt attached to it.
The earth used in potting the Blechium 
was fresh peat from Bedfordshire, mixed with wliite sand from this 
neighbourhood, neither of which could have contained the seed which 
had germinated, and which must have been brought in the soil attached 
to the root of the Fern from Ben Bulben.
I have dried the plant, and 
forwarded it to the Professor of Botany, Trinity College, Dublin, to be 
placed in the herbarium of the Dublin University.

(p.

every year, but never produces the pod or seed-vessels in its native soil, 
especially in these colder climates ; because most of its nourishment is 
spent in sending forth abundance of new twigs and leaves, by which it 
overspreads the whole ground ; but if it be put into a pot, and all its 
stolons or shoots be taken off, but one or two of the strongest, then it 
will produce the pod or seed-vessel, which shall contain seed till it ripen, 
according to the observation of Dr. Morison and Dr. Tournelort." Uay 
also notices the rarity of its fruiting (Methodus Plant, p.

Bromus ramosus, HnJs.
— Without disputing the distinctness of the 
ordinary British form from the possibly not indigenous B.
asper, L., 
of Beneken, it is as well to point out, by way of warning, that the restric- 
tion in our English plant of the number of lowest branches of the panicle 
to two is not an absolute diagnostic character.
In Hooker's ' Student's 
Flora ' they are described as 2-3-nate ; and Dr. Boswell-Syme pointed 
out to me in his garden at Balmuto a cultivated tuft of the grass, in 
which this was very conspicuously shown, near Linlithgow.
I also met 
this summer with a plant in which there were four branches at the base 
of the panicles, but agreeing in other characters with ordinary raviosus.
— W.
T. Thiselton Dyer.
I have several times noticed one common form with more than two 
branches at the lowest semi-verticil.
A plant which I collected at Win- 
chester this autunui had three branches, and Mr. Warren has sent me speci- 
mens from near Shrew^sbury with tht; same number.
As I pointed out at 
p. 270, it is by the coexistence of several characters that the plants are 
distinguished; probably the relative length of the awns and palea-, and of 
the two glumes, are the best single characters.
Dr. Ascheron, of Berlin, 
informs me that the restricted £.
aaper of Beneken is really the common 
form in many parts of Germany, though so scarce in more western 
Europe.

TEMPERATURE OP PUNGI.
Last week I met with a number of specimens of the Giant Puff-ball, 
Lycoperdon (/igcndenni, while making one of my usual weekly class excur- 
sions in the neighbourhood of Cirencester.
Two of them were selected, 
a large and a small one, for museum specimens, while a portion of a very 
large one was placed by me in my l)otanical box.
Next morning, on 
opening the box, I fouiul the contents sensibly warm to the hand, and 
had no difHciilty in tracing the eftect to its cause.
The portion of Pungus 
was quite warm, and had communicated part of its warmth to the other 
plants in the box.
Unfortunately, no thermometer was at hand at the 
time, or a careful reading of the temperature would have been made.
The smaller specimen of the Puff-ball, weighing 1 lb., was taken, and 
placed in a box, where it remained all night.
Next morning, two read-

by Dutrochet in five Fungi belonging to the genera Atjaricus, Boletus, and 
J,ycoperdon.
He. however, was only able to observe an increase of from 
0"10° C.
to 045° C, The greatest increase in ray specimen was noticed 
on the first morning of the observations, at 8.45 a.m., namely 1'2° C.
The greatest temperature is evidently produced during the night, as the 
difference between the temperature of the Fungus and air rapidly dimi- 
nished, so that at 11.15 a.m. the difference was only 0"2° C.
The difierence between the morning temperatures on the first and second 
day of the observations — 1'2° and 0'9° — can be easily accounted for by 
loss from conduction, etc., biit chiefly from the loss of heat caused by the 
evaporation of Avater, the weight of the Fungus having decreased from 
16 oz.
to 13^ oz.
during the three days the experiments lasted.
The cause of the increase of temperature is due to the oxidation of the 
nutrient materials in the Fungus, a process depending on the absorption 
of oxygen, which acts on these nutrient materials, and causes various me- 
tamorplioses, an equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide being liberated.
This metamorphosis of nutrient or assimilated materials goes on in all 
plants in dayliglit as well as in darkness, and is also associated with the 
taking up of oxygen and liberation of carbon dioxide, a process which is 
now recognized by all Continental ])hysiologists as the true respiration of 
plants.
In Spirogyra we can, during the day, observe the formation of 
assimilated materials as starch in tiie cells, which contain chlorophyll.
During thenitiht the assimilated material is metamorphosed or elaborated, 
and the cell divides and converts the assimilated material, after it has

been metamorphosed, into cellulose and protoplasmic substance.
In 
Fungi the nutrient materials are probably taken up only during- the day, 
and during the night metamorphosis, or elaboration of these materials, 
takes place.
Heat is the result of the oxygenation, and, from the energy 
of the process and size of the plant, the elevation of the temperature is 
very marked.
All the temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade, 
and, as the temperatures were always carefully observed by Professor 
Church, the accuracy of the readings may be depended on.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE GLACIAL ORIGIN OF THE PEAT- 
BOGS OF THE JURA AND THE SPECIAL A^EGETATION 
THAT CHARACTERIZES THEM.* 
By Professor Charles Martens.
The first requisite for the formation of a peat-bog is an impermeable 
foundation which water does not penetrate.
Tiie configuration of the 
surface plays only a secondary part ; thus peat-bogs are found in fiat 
countries like the borders of tlie Somme, Ems, and Weser, in Schleswig- 
Holstein and Holland, as well as in the valleys of the Vosges, Jura, and 
Scotch mountains ; sometimes even they establish themselves in slight 
depressions of steeply-inclined slopes.
Besides this, rains should not be 
too uncommon, the air must be habitually humid, and the heat of summer 
not too great.
In Europe they extend from Spitzbergen to the Pyrenees 
and the North of Italy, but do not pass further south.
In the Jura the 
obstacle which prevents the downward passage of water into the lower 
strata, is a bed of glacial mud derived from the trituration of the primi- 
tive felspathic, aluminaceous, and siliceous beds ; at the epoch of the great 
extension of the glaciers of the Alps the Jura was invaded by them, being 
included within the domain of the great glacier of the Rhone.
In spite 
of tlie destruction of a great many of them, the erratic blocks which it 
laid down are still very numerous.
The Jurassic peat-mosses have then a 
glacial origin, even when they are not barred by a moraine.
Suppress 
the moraine as a barricade in a great number of cases, suppress the glacial 
mud which makes the foundation impermeable, and the peat-moss would 
not be formed, and it is the same with those that are found beyond tlie 
range of the mountain-chains in Piedmont and the north of Switzerland.

Tl'.e iloras, as we have them at present, are not all equally ancient.
They mount up to epochs more or less remote and different.
Thus the 
Mediterranean flora goes back to the Miocene epoch.
It possesses, in 
fact, existing species which have been found fossil in the Tertiary strata by 
M. Sapnrta and other observers.
Certain remarkable species, like the 
Dwarf Palm, the Laurel, the Fig, the Olive, the Carob, the Pomegranate, 
the Myrtle, Anagyris foetida, Cneorum tricoccum, Neriuni Oleander', 
Smilax aspera, have not yet been reported from the Eocene or Miocene 
beds, but their affinities point clearly to an origin at an epoch when the 
JMedilerraiiean basin had a climate much more tropical than is the case 
now.
The flora of the Jurassic tuif-bogs is of a more recent date.
Its 
z 2

boreal character and tlie nature of the soil tliat supports it, shows clearly 
that it is Pliocene and contemporary with the olacial era.
The opinion of 
the geologists and botanists wlio suppose tliat at this era the vegetation of 
the regions of tlie globe which were invaded by the ice was absolutely null, 
does not appear to me well founded.
In fact, the glacial epoch exists still 
at the two poles.
Eound the Arctic pole, Greenland, Spitzbergen, and 
Nova Zembla, are covered with masses of ice, of which the branches stretch 
down to the sea, but still they have plants growing in the intervals which 
the ice does not cover.
In Spitzbergen there are 93 Phanerogamia ; in 
Greenland, 328.
Eobert Brown, who visited the Bay of Disco, in 70° 
N. lat., collected 129 species there in the course of a single summer.
These plants are not all special to the Arctic region, but many spread out 
towards the south; and, if we glance over the catalogue of these plants of the 
Jurassic turf-bogs, we find out of a total of 179 species, 73 are actually 
Arctic at the present day; besides these, there are 1 06 species not now found 
in the Arctic regions, but all of them, except Swe/iio, are Scandinavian.
Now, when we remember that the Neufchatelois Jura is 23° of latitude 
south of Lapland, is it absurd to suppose that at the glacial epoch its cli- 
mate was not more rigorous than that of Lapland is now, and that these 
Scandinavian species, of which the centre of creation is still to deter- 
mine, existed also at the epoch when the alpine glaciers overtopped the 
Jurassic ridges ?
I have elsewhere made the calculation that if the mean 
temperature of Geneva were lowered four degrees Centigrade, the glaciers 
of the Alps would again invade the basin of tlie Leman.
If this were 
the case, the temperature of the Jurassic valleys would still be higher than 
that of Altenfiord, in 70° N.
lat., where most of the species grow which 
Ave find now in the Jurassic peat-bogs.
The plants have persisted in the 
Jura in spite of a warming of the climate, amounting to four degrees, be- 
cause they have found in the constitution and humidity of the soil, condi- 
tions of existence analogous to those with which they are surrounded in 
Lapland at the present day.
Another proof that the climate of the glacial epoch, during which the 
erratic blocks of the Jura were laid down, was not rigorous enough to 
exclude all vegetation, is found in the fact that man inhabited the basin 
of the Leman, and that of the lakes of Zurich and Constance, immediately 
after the glacial epoch at Vierier, Meilen, and Schussenried, where we find 
worked Hints and reindeer bones in the alluvium of the terraces just above 
tiie glacial beds.
But if, as I have always believed, the old alluvium of 
Switzerland is contemporaneous with the same deposit in the plains of 
France, w^here incontestable proofs of the existence of man have been ob- 
tained, I do not despair of hearing that the Swiss geologists have found 
human bones and worked flints either in the midst of the glacial beds or 
even in the old alluvium on which they rest.
But to return to our plants.
By the area of their geographical distri- 
bution, they furnisii us with an argument wliich is not without value.
Spread through northern Europe, many of them stop at the Pyrenees and 
Alps.
In North America they stop generally at the fortieth degree of 
latitude.
Now these are the extreme limits of the great extension of 
glaciers of which the Arctic pole and the great European mountain-chains, 
situated at the north of 42°, were the principal centres.
The plants, 
therefin-e, grow now in the very regions then invaded by the glaciers.
We may say, perhaps, that the vegetation of the Jurassic turf-bogs, is 
NEW PUBLICATIONS.
341 
rot nn exceptional vegetation in this chain of mountains, and if it be ex- 
clusively Scandinavian, that of the whole Jurassic flora is equally so.
But 
in answer to this objection, read the list in Tliurmann's ' Essai Ph\to- 
staticfue of the characteristic mountainous plants of the chain ; of these, 
there are 142 species mentioned, out of which only 66 exist also in 
Scandinavia.
The presence of these Arctic species in the Jurassic turf- 
bogs, is then a confirmation of the opinion that they existed in the Jura 
at the "ilacial era.
All, in fact, can support a temperature lower than that 
of the Jurassic peaks, for all ascend higher in the Alps, and they can ac- 
commodate themselves to a more temperate climate, for I have gathered 
tliem nearly all in the north of Norway at the sea-level.
Another conse- 
quence of these facts is, that the vegetation of all the peat-mosses of the 
plains of northern Europe, of the Vusges, the hills of Anvergne, the Alps 
from France to Austria, and even of the Pyrenees has the same origin.
Por long botanists have been' struck with the uniformity of their vegeta- 
tion, and attributed it to a similarity of physical conditions.
This ex- 
plains why the plants stfiy there, but it does not explain why we always 
get the same species over a space equal to a quarter of the area of the 
whole terrestrial globe.
Identity of origin can alone explain this identity 
of vetictable forms.

By the Rev. W.
A. Leighton, F.L.S. 12ino.
Shrewsbury, 1871.
Within the last ten years no less than three Synopses, or systematic 
enumerations, of the British Lichens have been published in this country, 
viz.
Mudd's 'Manual of British Lichens,' in 1861; the Rev. J.
M. 
Crombie's ' Lichenes Britannici,' in 1870; and the work whose title 
heads the present remarks, in 1871.
The significance of this circumstance 
must be interpreted by the correlative fact that, between 1844, when the 
second edition of the well-known ' English Botany' of Smith and Sowerby 
was issued, and 1861, no work of a similar kind had appeared ; for Leigh- 
ton's ' British Species of Angiocarpous Lichens ' (1851), and other mono- 
graphs of his, referred only to certain groups ; while Lindsay's ' Popular 
History' (1856) did not profess to be a conqjlete or systematic Lichen- 
flora, being intended simply as an Introduction to the study of the 
liritish Lichens.
The three works first above mentioned, especially as 
compared with those which appeared prior to 1850, mark an era in British 
lichenology, in so far as they are all the fruits of the application of the 
hiicrosco/je to the detinition and classification of genera and species.
This 
instrument was virtually unknown to, or unapplied by, the authors of 
the various Lichen-floras of Britain — of England, Scotland, or Ireland 
— before the year 1850 ; the only artificial aid to the naked eye in the 
examination of external or internal characters being, up to that date, the 
common pocket lens.
The result of the introduction of the microscope iu 
the examination and determination of Lichen-species lias not been altoge- 
ther an advantage.
It lias destroyed the comparative sinq)licity of classi- 
fication and nomenclature, and has snbstitutcsd, for the intelligible arrange- 
ments of Aeharius, Fries, and Schiurer, tlie confusingly elaborate "systems" 
of Massalongo, Korbcr, and Nylander.

scopical or internal, too little of general or external, characters.
In par- 
ticular, too much consideration is given in classification to the character of 
the sporidla [which, by the way, in Leighton's ' Lichen-tlora ' are called 
spores, — a term of doubtful propriety, considering the close alliance be- 
tween Fungi and Lichens, and the desirability of a uniform nomenclature 
of the same classes of organs or bodies in these two great cryptogam ic 
families] ; too little allowance is made for the wonderful variations of the 
sporidla in many, if not most.
Lichen-species.
Chemical characters are, however, the last fashion of the day among 
lichenographers.
After having differentiated species and genera to a mis- 
chievously elaborate extent, according to the varying characters of the 
sporidla, they are being further subdivided according as the thallus, apo- 
thecia, or hymenial gelatine give this or that reaction with hydrate of 
potash, hypochlorite of lime, or solution of iodine.
\\\ no work that has 
come under our notice is so much attention devoted, we believe un- 
necessarily so, to these so-called " chemical characters " as in Leigh- 
ton's ' Lichen-flora.' Thus he subdivides the genus Cladonia according 
to the very variable chemical reactions of its species.
By such characters 
he separates sylvatica from rangiferina, and pnngens from furcata.
For a 
similar reason he divorces cana horajul/ata in the genus Alectoria I The 
specific diagnosis of Pertusaria faginea, L., is based on chemical reactions 
alone, for we are told " spores not seen " (p.
242).
Some of the marked 
irregularities of chemical reaction in Lichens, as applied to the diagnosis 
or definition of species, he himself not only admits, but is compelled to 
point out.
Thus, under the head of Umbilicaria erosa, Web.
(p.
158), he 
remarks, " In all our British specimens the reaction is medulla K — G 
red ; but in Fellm.
92, and specimens from Dr. Nyiander and Dr. T.
M. 
Fries, the reaction is medulla K yellow C — ." A similar irregularity is 
noted under Parmelia conspersa, Ehrh.
(p.
135) : " Weddell, in Lich.
Prom.
Publ., says that in P.
conspersa the medulla, when moistened with 
K, becomes yellow, but almost immediately afterwards becomes red.
This 
I am able to confirm fully, so far as regards foreign specimens ; but on 
British specimens the yellow reaction takes place, but not always the red." 
These are mere illustrations of what constantly happens throughout the 
whole family of Lichens !
Li truth, the reaction-test, introduced by Ny- 
iander and adopted by Leighton, is so little to be trusted, that its results 
vary, not only in the hands of different experimenters manipulating the 
same species, but in those of the same observer, operating on the same 
specimen at difierent dates !
Still more, then, is variation in result to be 
looked for in different specimens of the same genus, gathered under dif- 
ferent circumstances of soil and climate.
At present there seems no limit 
to the differentiation of Lichen-genera and species, and the necessarily 
involved multiplication of names, by the adoption of new " characters " 
that are trivial because they are inconstant.
Classification is based on no 
single, uniform, or intelligible principle.
Differentiation is determined 
sometimes by one character, sometimes by another, — the determining 
characters differing extremely in value, if sometimes they possess any 
value at all !
Small genera are divided, while large ones are left intact, 
though the characters of the species of the latter are infinitely more varied 
than those of the former.
In short, the whole system of arrangement is 
eminently arbitrary and artificial, complex and confusing.
In Leighton's 
Lichen-flora, for instance, while there is only one species of Usnea, there

are four of RamaUna ; Gladonla and Sllcla are each split up into three 
genera ; while the intricate genus Lecidea is left with the enoraious num- 
ber of 233 species !
Our recent British Lichen-floras are all based on the classification and 
nomenclature of Continental lichenographers ; and not a few of the addi- 
tions that have been made of late years to the number of British Lichens 
owe their names and descriptions to Dr. Nylander, of Paris, having been 
originally recorded in the llegensburg weekly botanical gazette called 
the ' Flora.' The British works in question necessarily, therefore, partake 
of the vices of the Continental systems on which they are based.
Thus, 
Leighton's ' Lichen-iiora ' — as do also Mudd's Manual and Crombie's 
Enumeration — illustrates the tendency of the modern school of licheno- 
graphy towards extreme differentiation; excessive and unnecessary elabora- 
tion ; mischievous multiplication of species and genera, and necessarily of 
names ; incessant changes of name, especially of species and varieties ; the 
nomenclature of inconstant and trivial varieties, instead of describing the 
general range and direction of variation ; the substitution of mere " spe- 
cific diagnoses " (so-called) for full descriptions ; the supercession of pri- 
mary external by secondary internal characters ; the adoption of inconstant, 
and therefore trivial, characters as a means of distinctive diagnosis ; the 
production and muUiplication of mere collectors and labellers, instead of 
biologists.
Hence, with all their excellences, we doubt whether such 
works as Leighton's ' Lichen-flora' are calculated to attract and multiply 
students of lichenology.
It seems to us hopeless to expect to increase the 
ranks of British lichenologists until we attain a greater measure of simpli- 
fication and intelligibility in our classification and nomenclature of the 
British Lichens.
Nor is such simplification to be expected till we revert, in 
some measure, to the arrangements that existed in the ^sre- microscope era 
of lichenology ; readopt the simpler classification and nomenclature of 
Acharius, Fries, and Schserer ; arrange and name according to naked-eye, 
external, general characters, so far as is possible, while not omitting any 
important natural character from the full descriptions of the species ; 
retluce the number of species to one-fourth or one-fifth by the adoption of 
type- or aggregate-species ; abolish the separate nomenclature ami rank of 
inconstant forms or varieties ; and work upon some uniform rule as to 
names.
Moreover, it must ever be borne in mind that lichenology docs 
not consist in the mere collecting and ticketinf/ of a aeries of specimens !
Our lichenologists are too much ?,\\\\'^\^ (jatherers and labellers!
I'hat 
herbarium is usually considered the most valuable, which contains the 
largest number of species and varieties, and especially of new or rare ones ; 
whereas that is really, in our opinion, the most interesting and useful 
collection that contains the greatest number of wc/Wrt/Zow^/or/y/A' of common, 
and especially of economical, species.
He is not the most usefully accom- 
plished naturalist who has gathered the greatest number of species or varie- 
ties, that prove, in the hands of Continental systcmatists or nomenelators, 
to be new or rare ; but he who knows most about all the characters — 
chemical, microscopical, economical, morphological — of our more familiar 
species, such as, among Lichens, the ubiquitous " Reindeer Moss," CJa- 
donia rangiferina.
Regarding that single species alone, a volume might 
l)e compiled equal in size to Leighton's ' Lichen-flora ;' and we believe 
that the student who should make himself nnister of the contents of such 
u monograph — of the whole " luitural history " of this cosmopolitan and

useful Cladonia, — its structure, reprotl action, chemical constituents, utility 
to man and the lower animals, the role it plays in the grand economy 
of nature in northern countries, its distribution and variation-forms under 
diversities of soil and climate, altitude and latitude, — would acquire a 
more valuable knowledge of Lichens than if he merely possessed an herba- 
rium containing authentically-named specimens of all the species desciubed 
in Leighton's ' Lichen-flora,' or even if he had himself collected them, 
and got them ticketed by Leighton or Nylander.
The latest-published work on British Lichens, that of Leighton, is not, 
as it might and perhaps should have been, in all respects the best.
Thus, 
it is inferior to the ' English Botany ' in so far as (1) the former contains no 
plates; (2) the latter gives general descriptions as well as specific diagnoses ; 
while (3) the older work has the advantage, also, of greater simplicity of ar- 
rangement, there being only 41 genera and 439 species instead of 73 and 
781.
So long as there is no work giving, in addition to full descriptions 
of species, plates illustrative of the external characters as well as internal 
structure of all British Lichens, the ' English Botany ' must continue a 
standard — if not, in a sense, the standartl — work on British Lichens, to 
which all other British Lichen-floras should bear more direct and distinct 
reference than at present they do.
It seems to us extremely desirable, for 
instance, that all British Lichen-floras should, until the ' English Botany ' 
is superseded by a modern work of the same type, — a fully-illustrated 
' Lichenographia Britannica,' — give the modern synonyms of all its genera 
and species.
Certain genera have been abolished by the use of the micro- 
scope, which has shown us that they consist merely of sterile conditions 
of species of other genera, or that they really belong to the category of 
Alyrie or Fungi.
Such are the pseudo-genera Lepraria, Spiloma, Variolaria, 
and Isldinm.
But these obsolete genera are so common, that it is much 
more important for the student to know what they really are — to what 
species to refer them — than to become acquainted with the mere names of 
hosts of new or rare species, which are, in every sense, comparatively un- 
important !
And yet there is no special exposition of these old and once- 
important genera in Leighton's ' Lichen-flora,' though doubtless some 
of them are named, or otherwise referred to, under such heads as Pertu- 
saria.
A satisfactory description of the obsolete genera and species of 
the ' English Botany ' would form a most useful and attractive essay on 
certain highly interesting features of the natural history of British Lichens, 
— including, as it would, an account of (1) the secondary reproductive 
organs ; (2) various forms of hypertro])hy, or degeneration, or arrested 
development, of the vegetative system ; (3) various forms and causes of 
sterility ; (4) the border-land between Lichens on the one hand, and Alyee 
and Fungi on the other.
And this kind of information, again, would be 
infinitely more important to the student, who is more than a collector and 
labeller, than any list, with specific diagnoses, of species, and especially 
of new and rare ones !
Leighton's ' Lichen-flora ' is inferior to Crombie's ' Enumeratio ' in 
that the latter possesses an index of species, though ic is neither quite 
correct nor quite comj^lete ; while Mudd's ' Manual ' is superior in that it 
gives fi^e plates of coloured drawings of sporidia, an index of species and 
varieties, an introduction descriptive of the general structure and morpho- 
logy of Lichens, measurements of the sporidia, frequent descriptions of 
the spermogones based upon personal observation, critical and general

remarks on the species, in addition to the mere specific dino^noses, and due 
notices of the minute (microscopic) parasites — Fungi, Lichens, or Fungo- 
Liciiens — tliat so frequently infest the thallus or apothecia of certain 
Lichen-species.
It is, moreover, better " got up," printed on better 
papei-, in more legible type.
No doubt all the additions that are desir- 
able to Leighton's ' Lichen-flora' — including, for instance, an index, 
glossary, bibliography^ and hilrodnction — would seriously increase the 
size of a volume which, at present is a convenient one, as respects both 
size and siiape.
But, on the other hand, the present volume is, pro tanto, 
incomplete and defective; while it is desirable that a national work on 
such a sul)ject should, be as complete in all respects as possible.
To the 
physiologist or biologist — to tl)e scientific or philosophic botanist — the 
paucity of information regarding the spermof/u/ies, and the utter absence of 
all reference to pycnides, are serious defects ; serious even in tlieir bear- 
ing upon a classijicatioii, which might have been materially altered by full 
descriptions of the secondary reproductive organs of those species in which 
they have been discovered.
The few references that have been made to 
spermogones, or their contents, by Mr. Leigiiton appear to have been 
taken at second-hand from Continental authors, probably Nylander.
The 
following are illustrations of the few bald, unsatisfactory descriptions or 
references given.
In the Cetrariei, we are told (p.
96), " Spermo(jonia mar- 
ginal, in setuliform apiculi or black papillae." In Flatysma (p.
98), 
" Spermogonia minutely papillate or tnberculate." In the Psoromiei (p.
163), " Spermogonia with arthro-sterigmata :" in the Imbricariei (p.
121), 
" Spermogonia innate." In Rlcasolia (p.
120), " Spermogonia in mas- 
toid prominences." In TJmbilicaria and the Placodei (j)p.
154 and 
174), " Sterigmata articulate." In Psoroma, and the Pannariei and Phys- 
ciei (pp.
163, 164, and 141), " Sterigmata pluri-articnlate." In ParintUa 
(p.
122), " Sterigmata 2-5-articulated :" in the Parmellel (p.
114), " Ste- 
rigmata pluri-articulate, or with arthro-sterigmata." In only certain genera 
and their subdivisions are the characters of the spermaiin given.
In 
Platysma (pp.
98-102), the genus is subdivided into sections according to 
the character of the spermatia, — the only instance, however, in wliieh they 
are here utilized in classification.
In the Ea-Lecunorei (p.
180) w(!
are 
told, " Spermatia various in form in ditferent species ;" but the variations 
in form in the different species are not given, so that such a statement is 
almost tantamount to no information at all !
In such a Lichen-flora as Leighton's there ought be a separate sec- 
tion, treating of the vegetable Micro-parasites that so commonly infest 
the thallus and apothecia of Lichens ; so frequently produce deformities 
of their fructification ; so often puzzle the student.
Or, at least, under the 
proper s|)ecies, mention should be made of their particular parasites.
But Leighton's work contains no enumeration of, or reference to, the 
Micro-fungi, or Fungo-lichens, that are parasitic on Lichen thalli or 
apothecia; and though the British parasitic species of Micro-lichens are 
given (e.g.) under such gcmerie heads as Lecidea, Ferrucnria, and Arlhonia, 
if we turn to sueli parasite-infested species as Sticta pnlmonacea, Pelti- 
gera canina, Parmelia saxatilis, P.

The following statistics, compiled from the works quoted, will serve to 
show both the general mimerical richness of the British Lichen-flora at 
different dates, according to diflerent authors ; and tlie rate of progress in 
the addition of so-called neio species, during the last thirty years.

! 
If progress in knowledge is to be measured by the number of species 
added withni a given period to a national Lichen-flora, it must be ad- 
mitted that the progress of British Lichenology has been very great since 
1 844, inasmuch as the number of British Lichens has been, during these 
twenty-seven years, nearly doubled— the actual numbers being 781 against 
439.
Such a criterion of progress is, however, utterly fallacious." The 
first effect of such large additions, in the form of new' species, is simply 
to bewilder the student, and render the existing confusion of classification 
"worse confounded." It seems to us infinitely more important to 
arrange in a simple, intelligible way, that will attract students, existino- 
niaterials, than incessantly and inordinately to hunt after " new and rare'" 
species, as is the fashion of the majority of our Lichenologists.
But in 
saying so, we do not deny that collectors and collections have a recoo-.
iiized value, and that they are indispensable to the progress of Licheno- 
logical science.
In the hands of the philosophic botanist new species 
will be relegated to their proper rank in classification, and they will be 
made to illustrate variations of form, peculiarities of local or general dis- 
tribution, affinities of geographical floras, as well as many phenomena of 
the highest interest in the physiology, organology, and 'classification of 
Lichens.
But, notwithstanding that, during the last thirty years, we 
have learned much concerning the minute anatomy of Lichen's, and espe- 
cially their reproductive organs ; as well as concerning their chemical con- 
stituents and^ their economical applications, such a work as Leighton's 
' Lichen-flora ' really gives, comparatively, less information concerning the 
general natural history of British Lichens than did the good old ' English 
Botany,' which is so apt now-a-days to be set aside by the microsc'ope- 
proud nomenclator.
The character of many, at least, of the "new species" recorded in 
Leighton's ' Lichen-flora ' may be gathered from the following illustra- 
tions.
Of Ferrucaria polysiicta, Borr.
(p.
422), we are told " This and/«5- 
cella may be only states of the same Lichen." Then why separate them until 
they are proved, by sufficient characters, to be distinct,' and each to require

Of variety rsl/iiobola, \Nh\uh., of Verrucaria m.nr- 
gacea, Wlilub.
(p.
416), " It is often difficult to separate this variety 
from the type." Tlien why make an arbitrary division ?
LeciJea sub- 
nigrata, Nyl.
(p.
316), " vix separanda a L.
deni.fjrota,''' says Nylander 
himself, who nevertheless creates the separate species.
Lecidea circaiii- 
pullens, Nyl. is "vix nisi varietas L.
bacciUifcr/B''' (p.
336).
L. spo- 
dodes, Nyl.
(p.
261), is "closely allied to L.
deulgrata, Fr., and proljably 
a subspecies, though externally distinct." L.
houinlolropa, Nyl.
(p.
337) 
is " near to L.

pUeay Var. Jlavens, Nyl. of L.
parasema, Ach.
(p.
270), " Latet sub 
elodochroma, Ach.
(ex lib.
Ach.) a quti etiam parum diversa." Then wliy 
cumber an already complex Lichen-flora with unnecessary names and 
species?
What necessity is there for, or what advantage in, naming and 
giving separate rank to such forms, conditions, or states, of species as 
var.
terrestrls, Nyl. of Lecanora varia, or form cinerascens, Nyl., of L.
badia ?
This is a kind and degree of elaboration that is simply mis- 
chievous.
It would seem, moreover, that, in not a few cases, species are 
based on a single imperfect specimen.
This is the case apparently, for 
instance, with Pertmaria sublactea, Leight.
(p.
24.5), of which it is noted 
that the spores are " unknown :" nor were they " seen " in the case of 
P.faginea, L.
(p.
242).
In describing the " extensive portions of our country still unexplored 
as to Lichens," Mr. Leighton is in error in including " The whole of the 
north and north-western counties of Scotland, including the Hebrides, Ork- 
ney, and Shetland Isles." For so long ago as 1841, the Hebrides were 
botanically " explored " by Professors Balfour, of Edinburgh, and Babing- 
ton, of Cambridge, whose " Catalogue of the plants gathered in the islands 
of North Uist, Harris and Lewis," — including Lichens, — appeared in the 
'Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh,' in 1844 ; while, 
so lately as 1866 and 1869, the Lichen-flora of Caithness, Sutherland and 
Inverness-shires, of Orkney, Sliethmd, and the Hebrides was the subject of 
special investigation by Dr. Lindsay.
Large collections were made, and a 
list of some of the commoner species has already been published.
Indeed 
in Mr. Leighton's own work he gives a number of localities in 'Lewis' 
(the Hebrides), 'Orkney'; 'Hebrides'; ' Coygach, Sutherlandshire ' ; 
'northern parts of Scotland'; 'Long Island' (= the Lews or Lewis, 
Hebrides) ; ' Inchnadanf, Sutherland' ; ' Glen Ach-na-Sliilloch, Ross-shire' ; 
' Loch Carron' (Ross-shire) ; ' Orkney Islaiuls' ; ' Brough Head in island 
of Stronsa, Orkneys' ; and ' Lerwick, in Shetland.' There can be no doubt, 
however, that for those Lichenists, whose ambition is to collect specimens, 
in the hope of Nylander, or other Continental nomenclator, discovering 
novelties or rarities among tiieir gatherings, there is still ample scope 
in the British islands, even in the districts that have been the most fre- 
quently and thorouglily " explored." But collectors are so much more 
numerous than biologists that we would counsel the student, instead of 
hunting for " new species," to devote his attention to those that have 
been already discovered, making himself master, not only of their na,ines 
and their specific duignoscs, but of all their characters, including their 
various uses.
Such has been the activity of collectors and name-givers of 
late years, even since the issue of Crombie's 'Emimeratio' last year, that 
we can well afford to pause in our efforts to add to the number of the 
British Lichens, and cultivate a more thorough accjuaintauce with the pre- 
sent, only too numerous, meuibcrs of our Lichcn-llura.

We have often been asked by the owners of gardens, interested in 
botany, where they could find a handbook in which was gathered together 
an account of the common hardy cultivated plants of the country.
A 
little time ago it was not possible to answer the question satisfactorily, but 
now those who want such a book will find in the present work and in a 
similar one, published a year ago by Mr. Sutherland, who was formerly 
head of the herbacL^ous department at Kew, all that they can reasonably 
require.
Both the authors are men of large experience and a thorough 
knowledge of their subject practically, and the books are published at 
such a moderate price that they are likely to command a large circulation.
We trust that the publication of the two works may be taken as a sign 
that gardening taste is beginning again to flow in wider channels than 
those in which it has run during the last dozen or twenty years, for most 
lovers of British botany will agree with Mr. Robinson, when he says, " It 
is to me a cause of surprise that while we find persons going to great 
expense to build a glass box wherein to preserve a little of the pretty 
vegetation of New Holland, and other warm climates, which is of neces- 
sity always less beautiful and less satisfactory than vegetation flourishing 
in the free air, we may seek in vain in their gardens for a group of the 
noble hardy Lilies, for the vividly coloured and beautiful early spring 
flowers of northern and temperate climes, or for any interesting and 
beautiful hardy vegetation.
We live in a country which is, on the whole, 
better calculated for the successful culture of the most beautiful vegetation 
of northern and temperate climes than any on the face of the earth, and, 
at present, we take as much advantage of it as if we lived in one where 
from extremes of some sort, such vegetation could not exist, and where 
extraordinary and expensive artificial means were requisite for the enjoy- 
ment of a little vegetable beauty.
That the natives of cool latitudes are 
of an inferior degree of beauty cannot be admitted.

iiian_Y aspects of vegetation give the palm to that of the meadows, heatiis, 
and uplands of cool countries, and the high mountain sides, near the line

do not surpass in beauty Lilies and Irises, that are as easily grown as 
common Seiikale " (pp.
2-3).
The bulk of the present work is taken up with a catalogue, arranged 
in alphabetical order, of thirteen hundred species of perennial duration, 
selected from the great mass of hardy plants on account of their superior 
beauty, with a description of the general habit of each, the colour of its 
flowers, the time of the year at which it appears, the kind of soil and situa- 
tion for which each is best fitted, and the mode in which it can be most 
readily propagated.
Of course, such a list of favourite plants made by 
one man will never contain everything that another would wish to see in 
it, but the selection of genera and species has been made with great care 
and judgment.
The rest of the book is taken up with chapters of general 
directions as to cultivation,, with advice on the subject of arranging plants 
to the best advantage for display, and with copious lists of species of 
difl'erent habit, colour of flower, time of blooming, etc.
The following is

chapter on the grouping of hardy perennials : —

Unhappily the fine hardy kinds 
of Lilies are anything but as plentiful as they should be, though in a free 
rich soil they increase readily enough.

ally worked down to the edge with dwarf but beautiful kinds, like exi- 
niiinu, lo>igiJlorum, and teniti folium, a large circular oval bed might be 
made in the grass in some isolated spot which for the highest beauties of 
colour, form, and fragrance, for in fact almost every quality by which 
vegetable beauty endears itself to us, could not be surpassed by any 
arrangement of indoor or outdoor plants.

be mentioned is, that to grow Lilies well they should have three feet, or 
nearly that, of free loamy earth with a good dash of vegetable mould in

Of the catalogue we need say little beyond what is contained in the 
title, and letting our readers know that there is such a list in existence, if 
they require it.
It is intended, like tlic ' London Catalogue,' esfiecially 
for marking desiderata, and for enabling collectors to check off, in a handy 
printed list, the species they possess.
No authorities are given with the 
names, and a large number of mere garden-names are included ; but the 
duration of each species is indicated, and those that are wild in Britain 
are printed in a dill'erent type to the rest.

The part for 1870 of the Copenhagen * Botanisk Tidsskrift ' contains 
a paper by Professor Laiige on the characters derived from the shape of 
the seeds and the sculpturing of the testa, of which we should like to 
give our readers an abstract, if any of our contributors could read Danish.
It treats specially of Pyrolaceae, Droseraca, Cerastium and Pediciilaris, 
and there are plates of the seeds of twenty-five species of the last genus, 
A lecture was given at Kichmond on the last Friday in September by 
Mr. M.
Moggridge on the scenery, geology, and botany of the neighbour- 
hood of Mentone, the natural history of w hich he and his son have done 
so much lately to explore and illustrate.
The greatest height that can be 
reached by walking parties from the town, returning the same day, is the 
peak of Granniendo, 4523 feet in elevation, commanding splendid views, 
and yielding to the botanist many truly alpine plants ; whilst late in the 
spring it is dotted over with the crimson blossoms of the wild Peony 
{JPceonia feregrina).
At the sea level the olive becomes a forest tree; and 
the lemon, far more delicate, yields four crops in the year.
He has lately 
discovered in the neighbourhood worked flints, imbedded in solid breccia, 
at a depth of thirty feet, in company with the bones of the bear, hyena, 
and rhinoceros.
At the exhibition of the Royal Horticultural Society at Soutli Kensing- 
ton, in the first week of October, an interesting feature was the collectiou 
of fungi, edible contrasted with poisonous and unwholesome species, 
shown in competition this year, as in previous ones, for a prize oifered by 
Mr. Wilson Saunders.
The main exhibitors were Mr. Worthington Smith, 
Mr. English of Epping, and Messrs.
Hoyle and Austen of Reading ; the 
latter of whom took in conjunction the principal prizes.
An address on 
the subject of the suitability of fungi for food was delivered by the 
Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, and attentively listened to by a large gathering of 
ladies and gentlemen.
It was generally admitted that this year's exhibi- 
tion was a decided advance on any of its predecessors.
There is an abstract in the ' Gardener's Chronicle' for September 30 of 
an interesting series of observations by Professor Goeppert, of Breslau, on 
the protective influence as regards the temperature of the soil exercised by 
a thick layer of snow.
In February of the present year he took the 
temperature three times daily in the air and twice below the snow, and 
found that whilst the daily means oscillated between 2-8° Cent, on the 
16th instant, and 17'6° on the sixth, the average below the surface was 
1'5° on the former day and 5° on the latter.
He ascribes the loss of 
many alpine species in lowland gardens to the want of a protective layer 
of snow during the winter season.
Those interested in the subject ought 
to read the paper in detail.

Gray states that he re-examined P.

and finds the anthers are quite as much introrse as extrorse as to insertion, 
and truly introrse for dehiscence.
A transverse section removes all doubt, 
showing the connective to be posterior, and the anther, consequently, to 
be as truly introrse as possible.
Mr. MacOwan, of Gill College, Somerset East, Cape of Good Hope, who 
has been working very energetically lately in the exploration of the eastern 
tracts of the colony, and has established amongst the few Cape botanists 
an Exchange Club, on the model of our English one, writes to say that he 
wishes to be introduced to some British and European botanists desirous of 
having eastern Cape plants.
For Britain he possesses only the wreck of 
a collection almost destroyed in transit to the colony, and for western 
and central Europe nothing at all.
We hope that some of our readers 
will be able to help him, and can speak from personal knowledge of the 
excellence of the specimens he sends out.
The meetings of the Linnean Society will be resumed to-morrow, 
November 2, for the winter, beginning at the regular hour, eight o'clock.
A report of the result so far of the labours of Mr. Chalmers, who went 
out from Kew in 1868 for the purpose of establishing a Cinchona planta- 
tion in St. Helena, and improving generally its arboriculture, has been 
drawn up by Mr. J.
C. Melliss, the late surveyor of the Crown lands in the 
island, who is now in this country.
A suitable plot of land for the 
Cinchona, five acres in extent, was secured on the southern and windward 
side of the great central bridge, at an elevation of 2600 feet above the sea.
Several Cinchona plants, including some raised from seed a year or two 
previous to 1868, were placed out in different parts of the high lands, 
secluded spots, safe from the tracks of cattle, amongst the native vegeta- 
tion, being selected for them; and in the following year (1860) the 
general planting of 5 acres commenced, sufficient young plants by that time 
having been raised by seed, given to the island by Dr. Hooker.
At the 
present time the plantation presents, in a healthy thriving condition, 500 
trees of Cincliona sncciruhra and 300 of C.
officinalis, numbering in all 
800 plants; the tallest of these is a plant of C.
officinalis, raised by Mr.
Melliss, and planted out on the high land on October 14, 1868.
It now 
measures 7 feet 2 inches above the ground.
The next tallest tree in the 
plantation is one of C.
snccirubra, planted out ni May, 1869, and now 
measuring 6 feet above the ground.
About 300 of those first put out 
average a height of 4 feet 6 inches, and the remainder vary from that 
down to 6 inches.
The cultivation of the species C.
Calisaija and C.
Pahudiana has not been continued, because it was found tliat in St.
Helena they do not grow so well as the other species.
The nature of 
the ground fornnng the plantation is very steep and rugged, which 
prevents it from being planted very thickly.
It is incapable of con- 
taining more plants ; and the fact of the surrounding land being in 
the hands of private persons, who do not as yet see the advantage 
to be derived from the cultivation of this valuable plant, is the chief 
reason for the non-extension of the plantation.
The actual cost of the^le 
800 trees, exclusive of l\Ir. Chalmers' salary, and such outlay as could 
not be fairly charged against a limited number of plants, has been 
£244.

which is about the same as in three previous years.
An interesting ex- 
cursion was made to the coalfields of Indiana, which were visited by 400 
excursionists.
They travelled in eight coaches, and rested for the night 
at Terre Haute, a town of 20,000 inhabitants, where lectures were 
delivered by Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins on winged reptiles, and by Dr.
Gray on the fertilization of flowers by insects.

minster, for the competition of members of botanical, microscopical, and 
geological clubs, working-men's clubs, and the unprofessional natiu'alists 
of London generally.
The subjects selected by the prize-givers require 
from the competitors an acquaintance with the mosses, pond-niicrozoa,

ON THE BOTANY OF THE LIZARD PENINSULA.
By J.
G. Bakek, F.L.S.
Cornwall is one of those counties of Britain the distribution of plants 
within which is most imperfectly registered.
As an extreme term for the 
island both in climate and <reograpliical position it possesses a special 
interest, and ils geological character is in addition so pecidiar, that it 
would be very interesting to have its flora worked out in full detail.
It 
is likely that thei'e is not much left to be done in discovering rarities 
within its area, but a botanist, like myself — coming there from the 
eastern or central parts of the island, and knowing its flora so far as pub- 
lished records reach, the species that grow within the county as a whole, 
with a notion of comparative abundance and dispersion of the special 
rarities — finds much to interest him in seeing how abundant some of the 
specially western species are, and how many plants which he takes for 
granted are likely to be common, are found to be rare, or even altogether 
al)seut, from wide tracts.
It is as a contribution towards a Cornish flora 
of this kind that these notes are put on record.
The Lizard peninsula 
is not only the most southern, but botanieally the most characteristic 
and interesting part of the county.
The following list was made 
dnring a visit paid in August of the present year by Mr. A.
W. 
Bennett and myself under the guidance of Mr. T.
R. A.
Briggs, whose 
previous knowledge of the district, and intimate practical acquaintance 
with west-country species in a living state, enabled us to make the cata- 
logue much more complete than it wouhl otherwise have been.
The 
line of north limit within which we restricted ourselves was the 
high road that passes from Falmouth to Helston through Penryn, 
This encloses an area of something like a hundred square miles, and in- 
cludes, in addition to the Serpentine region that fills up all the southern 
part of the Lizard promontory, both a tract on the north of it, underlaid 
by sedimentary Devonian strata, and a slice out of the tract of low undu- 
lated granite hills that fills up portions of the central ridge of the county, 
and the whole of the extreme west between Penzance, St. Ives, and the 
Laud's End. The Serpentine extends from the west shore of the Lizard 
promontory at Mullion, past the north side of Goonhilly Downs, to the 
opposite shore at Manaccan, filling up an area of forty square miles.
The 
centre of this is a bare uncultivated heathery plateau, rising to not more 
than tin-ee or four hundred feet above sea-level, almost entirely destitute 
even of planted trees, but a bare unbroken waste, extending in one ])art 
nearly fi'om shore to shore, with abundance of Furze, both vernal ami 
autumnal, intermixed with four kinds of Heath, the three that grow every- 
wh(!re, and v(i(jrins more abundant than any of them, no ciliaris here at 
all, allliongh it is plentiful a little beyond our bounds about Truro, broad 
open grass-bordered roads edged with Aijroslia vulgaris, Fcdnca ovina, 
Alra caryophi/llen, and Triodia, with PUtntago marUinia and Coronopus, 
Saffhia nodosa and Anllmnis nohUls mixed abundantly amongst them, and 
peaty pools in which the streamlets that run down the shore take their 
rise, yielding plenty of Sc/.rpi/s flailaiis, Jnncnn .i//jj/i//i\, Jftdosciadiiim

itiimdattim, Mi/riopJiijUnm alteruiflorimi, Hydrocotyle, and PcpUs ; but no- 
where any scrap to be seen of Drosera, Sphagnum, or Nartliec'mm, all of 
which are coramon enough upon Dartmoor.
This curious Serpentine 
region is not drained by any streamlet, even of moderate size, but only a 
few little rills run from the central moor to flow into the hollows between 
the great sea-crags, which are very fine all round this portion of the coast, 
but often only to be seen from the sea, or at considerable risk and expen- 
diture of time from below at low tide.
On the southern and western side 
of the down, between the little villages of Lizard-town, Llandewednack, 
Cadgwith, and the three neighbouring hamlets that take their name from 
Saint Ruan, the country is to a large extent brought under cultivation to 
the very edge of the seal)ank, but even here there are no hedges, and tlie 
pastures and corn or forage fields are separated from one another only by 
walls or earthy banks, on the top of which it is the custom of the country 
to carry the footpaths.
So that it is only about the lower part of some 
of the streamlets that we get in the Serpentine tract any fruticose or ar- 
boreal vegetation, except it be a row of planted Tamarisks, or a stray 
Apple-tree, or an Elder, or planted Poplar near a house ; and even in the 
midst of summer the region looks very monotonous and dreary, with no- 
thing to check any wind that blows from east or Avest or south from 
sweeping right across it, and nothing to shelter plant or belated traveller 
from rain or storm, except a wall or earth-bank three or four feet in height, 
and not even that for miles across the open down.
In considering the 
flora of the district, these circumstances need to be prominently borne in 
mind, for not only does there result from this exposedness a great cutting- 
off of sylvan and septal species that might otherwise be expected, but 
many well-known plants put on peculiar forms, clearly in consequence of 
the peculiar circumstances under which they are placed.
Of Genista tinc- 
toria, Arenaria verna, and Spartlnm scoparium, varieties from the district 
have been named akeady, and we may instance also Anthi/lUs Vidnerarin {A.
B'dlenu) and Lotus corniculatus, as occurring with fleshy leaves, and more 
or less reddish flowers, Poterium SangnlHorha, Sanguisorba officinalis, 
Serratula tinctoria, and Centnurea nigra, reduced down in extreme cases to 
monocephalous forms two or three inches in height, and Daucus maritimus 
and Crithmum dwarfed down to a single tuft of radical leaves, with a single 
umbel nearly or quite sessile in the centre.
There is very little scope in 
the Serpentine tract for the maritime plants that affect sandy beaches.
Of 
the walls and earthbanks that border the shore, the most abundant plants 
are Armcria marilima, Cerastium tetramlrnm, Spergnlaria rupestris, Sllene 
viaritima, and Beta marithna^ with a wonderful quantity of Crithnuin and 
Ramalina scopulorum everywhere about the rocks, and on the sandy slopes 
Aira caryoplujllea.
Thymus, Jauone, Plantago Corunopus, Herniaria, Scilta 
verna and S.
autumnalis, and Seduni anglicum.
On the north of the 
Serpentine tract we pass on the north-east of Goonhilly Downs about 
Manaccan, Helford, St. Martin, and St. Anthony, into a tract of Devonian 
country where there are lanes and hedgerows, in which shade-loving plants 
like Hypericum Androsmnum, Calamintha officinalis, Aspidium angular e, 
and Nephrodium remuluni show themselves, and where Erica vagans, Her- 
niaria glabra, Arenaria verna, the Scillas, and many more special Serpen- 
tine species are left behind.
The creek that runs into the interior, south 
of Falmouth, for many miles, and nearly joins at its head the hollows 
that run down in a western direction past Helston to Looe pool would, 
ON THE BOTANY OF THE LIZARD PENINSULA.
335 
perhaps, have been a more natviral northern boundary for our list than 
the one we liave taken.
North of tlie creek, the space between the eastera 
and western shore of the promontory is not less than ten miles, and there 
is in the centre a tract of undulated s;ranite-country that stretches from 
Constantine and Helston beyond our bounds into the centre of the county, 
and on the east of this, stretching down to the shore of Falmouth, ex- 
tends a tract of still more decidedly sylvan and sheltered Devonian country 
wliich furnishes a marked contrast with the Serpentine.
Here are situated, 
on the sloping banks of a small stream, opening out towards the south- 
east to the mouth of Falmouth harbour, the garden and grounds of Pen- 
gerrick, the residence of K.
W. Fox, Esq., F.R.S., in which are cultivated 
in the open air a large number of trees and shrubs of delicate constitution, 
that cannot be grown without winter-shelter round Loudon.
We saw 
here a llhododendron, measuring ISO feet in circumference, and well- 
established trees or bushes, grown without shelter, of Erica arborea, 
Laiirun Camphora, various species of Eucalyptus, Mctrosuleros, and Mela- 
leuca, several of the long-leaved Mexican Pines and Sikkim Rhododen- 
drons, ChaiiKerops humUis, Beutltamia, Arhntas, and Pernttlya with ripe 
fruit, a tree of Pruiins Laurocerasns, 40-.50 feet high, with a trunk as 
thick as a man's body, flowering tufts of I*liorm'mm ieiiax, bushes of blue- 
flowered Ilydrangi-as growing by dozens like Willows by the stream-siile, 
Aponoijelon diduchymn producing copious flowers and fruit, acclimatized 
I'leris crelica, and IFoodwnrdia radicans, S(dnrj'mc;lla KruHssin)ia making 
itself quite at home amongst the grass of the lawn mixed with indigenous 
llypmim and PtagwcJiila, EcJwveria glauca growing out permanently in 
beds with Canarian ScmpervicHm and Cape Mesembryanlhemuvis, and many 
other interesting indications of what horticulture may accomplish in a 
climate where the thermometer seldom sinks below freezing-point, and 
bedding Geraniums {Pdanjoniam zonale) hist sometimes through winter 
witliout drooping their leaves.
In the following catalogue we have noted only those species which we 
saw ourselves in an excursion of four days' duration, during which we 
directed our attent ion specially to the dispersion of the mass of species, in 
preference to spending our time in searching minutely for rarities already 
recorded.
At the time of our visit, of course some of the early-flowering 
plants were no longer recognizai)le.
For instance, we could not make out at 
Caerthilian the three rare Trefoils {Buccoiil, atrictum, and Molh/erii) which 
grow there in company on an exposed sandy bank, and are in perfection 
in June.
I liave noted also in their regular sequence several jilants which 
we expected, i)ut failed to see, as many conunon species fall under this 
head, and there can be no doubt that the desiderata of this Lizard flora 
furnish one of its most remarkable characteristics.
It is likely that the 
plants which we failed to see are at most comparative rarities, but I hope 
that those who follow us into the district will take our catalogue as a 
basis, and place their additions to it upon record, aiul that botanists of 
the P(Miinsula, residents and visitors, will bear in memory that an interest- 
ing question in English botanical- geography, about which as yet very 
little has been said, in addition to what Mr. Watson has summarized by 
gathering together the plants of a strikingly eastern plan of dispersion 
under his Cicrmanic type of distriijiition, is how many plants common 
enough all through the centre of England run out more or less decidedly 
in the south-west.

ON SUNDANESE VERNACULAR NAMES.
By Dr. H.
C. C.
Scheffer, 
Botanical Gardens, Buitenzorg.
Dr. Seemann published in the seventh volume of the ' Journal of 
Botany ' (page 333) an article treating of vernacular names and their 
great consequence.
Of how much importance they are I can observe 
ON SUNDANESE VERNACULAR NAMES.

daily.
It lias already been mentioned by different antbors tliat the in- 
habitants of" the western part of Java (the ISundanese) are known to be 
good botanists, and tliat they use in sonie degree tiie Linnajan nomen- 
clature.
They have ordinarily names for certain groups, and for the 
species of tliese groups they have also a special name.
In the classification 
of tliese groups they often are mistaken, but this is especially the case 
with those plants that are only to be found iu tlie woods of the higher 
regions; for, as there are no villages (kampoenjj), the names of those 
plants are unknown to them.
As an illustrating instance I give the 
name of tjanl'uji (pron.
tyanteeguee), which they apply to nearly all the 
Ericaceae, to Mijrsine and Leplospermum, and perhaps to other plants 
with leaves similar to the above-mentioned.
Mr. Motley's remark, quoted by Mr. ColUns in the same volume, page 
36 1, is thus very true.
For example, the name for nearly all the Lan- 
rii/ea is koeroe (vYOii. hooroo), at 8uinatra and Haugka md(Mi/ff ; for all 
the Melastomacece, hdrhidoug ; for almost all the Perns, ^«/.oe (pron.
pakoo) ; for all the epiphytous Orchids, diiggrtk ; for several Acanthacea 
and Lablutce, djarong ; the name kiara (pron.
kee-ara) is used for many 
species of the genus Flcns ; kilampani (keelainpanee) for Ard'mu and 
Vlhiiucavdra ; kaiieka for the RldzophorecB ; pdm for Oaks.
Concerning 
Dr. de Vry's remarks, also quoted by Mr. James Collins, I must remark, 
(1) that klara is only the name for certain groups of the genus Fie us ; 
for the other groups otiier names are adopted : (2) that the Qnercus 
fusifurmis, Jungh.
{Q.
Jmujlinhnii, Miq.) does not bear the name o^ kiara.
Tliis tree, as is known, varies from the other Quercus by its peculiar 
habit and by its fruits.
It is thus not surprising that the natives 
do not recognize tliis tree as a Quercus {pasan).
Junghuhn misunder- 
stood the name, which is really tjara-anak \tjara — resembling to ; anak 
= children).
In other parts of Sunda the name is rijoeng-anak (pron.
rccyoong-anak ; rijoeug = around).
There are two causes for depreciating the value of vernacular names.
The first cause is that not all the natives know all the indigenous plants.
Must of them know the names of those common plants which are used 
for medical and culinary purposes, but only few know the plants which 
are found in the midst of tlie forest.
Besides, the natives believe it un- 
polite not to answer a question, and, to please the interrogating traveller, 
they give a name of whose exactness they are not certain.
The second 
cause is tlie small linguistic knowledge of most of the travellers.
I 
have always applied myself to a careful inquiry about vernacular names, 
and tliough 1 am already a little accustomed to the foreign Sundanese 
souiuls, 1 am often obliged to (piestion my collectors several times before 
getting certainty about the names.
One must be accustomed a long 
time to a language before being able to catch the sounds.
Usually the i\Ialayan names are given more correctly than tlie Sun- 
danese ones.
The greater part of the Europeans in the Archipelago 
speak more or less the Malayan language, but those who speak also Suji- 
danese are very few.
In consequence a great confusion is to be found 
in the Sundanese names.
For their specific names they like to use some characteristic words: for 
example, soesoe (pron.
soosoo), they use for a fruit which has the form of 
the breast of a young maiden ; cnrit (pron.
cureet), properly mouse, for a 
small sort; miujak (oil = smooth), for unarmed species of a genus that 
commonly possesses thorns (for example, Erglhrina).
360 AN AKRANGEMENT OF THE BRITISH WILLOWS.
The si2;nifieation of some names is often very obscure; in other names 
it is easy to be found, e.
g., kntoe-ioemjkoel (pron.
katootoongkool), tlie 
name of a species of Polygala of the subgenus Chamcchiixm.
Toeuylcod 
signifies to Imn over; ka is the prefix for the passive form ; /oe a very 
common reduplication.
The whole name is derived from the fact that 
the pericarp is leaning over the seeds ; the seeds are thus considered 
passive, and the plant named after the seeds.
I am persuaded that, by 
a careful study of the Sundanese language and of the names of plants, it 
will be easy to find other similar interpretations.
I cannot agree with Mr. Motley, when he says that the Sundanese do 
not possess a written language.
They employ characters which are 
nearly similar to the Javanese ones.
Their literature is not very extended, 
but they possess some manuscripts.
It would be very desirable that a general manner of spelling were 
adopted for all the vernacidar names ; for, as all the botanists have written 
them after their own pronunciation, a comparison is hitlierto impossible.
To prove this assertion, I might cite the Malayan names, collected by 
English and Dutch botanists.
The importance of this remark is very 
obvious in comparing the vernacular names of Palms, given by Griffith.
AN ARRANGEME.VT OF THE BRITISH WILLOWS.
By the Rev. J.
E. Leefe, M.A., E.L.S.
Professor Babington was so obliging, a year or two ago, as to send me 
a sketch of an arrangement of the British Willows, based upon the methotl 
of Dumortier.* Duiuortier's writings I have not seen ; but Fries in his 
Novit.
Fl. Suec.
Mantiss.
prima, p.
37, anno 1882, refers to two ar- 
rangements suggested by that botanist, of the former of which, taken 
from the nectary, he says that it is " omni atteutione iligna." I may 
remark that Koch, in his ' Commeiitatio de Salicibus Europaeis," anno 
1828, did not fail to notice that characters are to be derived from the 
nectary ; and constantly refers to the proportion between the pedicel and 
the nectary in the different species, apparently knowing nothing of 
Dumortier's observations ; and even Seringe, anno 1815, remarks that 
" Les glandes Horales ou nectaires presentent aussi quelques caractcres." 
Both Fries and Dumortier, it would seem, from Professor Babiuiiton's 
paper, adopt pretty much the same subgenera.
I hope an old-fashioned 
observer of Wdlows may be pardoned for thinking that, in a natural 
genus like Salix, it is inadvisable to distract the student's attention by 
the introduction of new subgeneric names, if it can be avoided ; and es- 
pecially of names which do not carry an obvious useful meaning on the 
face of them, but are rather a burden upon the memory.
With a view to contribute something, so far as I am able, towards 
establishing clear and workable characters in this difficult genus, I wouhl 
now beg to be permitted to make a few remarks on the sectional cha- 
racters proposed by Mr. Babington in his interesting paper.
Section 1.
FUisalix, Dumort.
Mr. Babington says, Catkins and their 
leafy stalk deciduous together.
Nectary of two pieces ; vernation convo- 
lute.
The peduncle (the leafy stalk) of the catkins in the Pentandrce, Fra- 
* Published iu this Joiu-iial, Vol. I.
(18G3), pp.
167-172.
AN ARRANGEMENT OF THE BRITISH WILLOWS.
361 
g'tles, Alhe, and Triaudree is often permanent, the catkins being separately 
detaclied.
Hence arise the short leafy branches, often seen in tlie sum- 
mer, having buds in the axils, from which the catkins have fallen.
Peduncles with buds in the axils may be expected not to be caducous.
The Penlandrne may l)e distinguished from the Frcujiles by the petioles, 
which are glandular above, and the glandular serratures in the lower part 
of the leaf, a character rarely seen in the Fragile^ or Triandrre.
The AUite 
differ in the ciliated leaves of the peduncle.
The young leaves iu all are 
inflexed.
The nectary in the PeiUdndrce, Albre, Frai/'den, and Triandrm 
is doidjle in the male, but only single in the female, according to my ob- 
servations.
The nectary in the male of aS.
alha-ccdrnlen is generally notched 
next the axis, and a single gland between the stamens and the scale.
In 
S. cnspidata, male, E.
Bot.
§uppl., I find the nectary to be deeply notched 
next the axis, and sometimiis there are two or three next the scale, the 
whole forming a sort of cup, out of which spring the stamens.
More- 
over, I see a remark in my notebook that in S.
f'nujHU, S.
alba, S.
ctvrnlea, 
and *S^.
cufpidata, male, E.
Bot. Suppl., the nectary next the scale is seated 
rather higher than that next the axis.
S. triandra, S.
nudalala, S.
cns- 
pidata, S.
peniaudra are rather large shrubs than trees.
Although the 
young leaves in FUis/illx, Uumort., Bab., are generally inflexed, yet in 
*S'.
hippo phaefoUa, Tluiil., usually placed among the Triandra:, the young 
leaves are partly reflexed, — indicating, it would seem, some affinity with the 
Viniinales or with S.
rubra, Hiids.
Section 2.
Caprisalix, Duuiort.
The characters which Professor 
Babington gives are in accordance with ray own observations.
Subsection 1.
Helice.
The young leaves in the Piirpuretx, Borr., are 
generally inflexed, except that in the male of S.
rubra, Huds., they are 
somewhat reflexed, as in S.
hippophacfoUa, Thuil., above noticed.
The 
nectary in the Pnrpuj-ere and P^imittales is single, both in the male and 
female, and placed as Professor Babington describes.
Subsection 2.
Vimen.
I And the stamens free and the nectary some- 
what elongated.
The young leaves are (piite rolled back or reflexed at the 
niargia.
The peduncle in Caprinalix, Dumort., is not persistent.
In 
Fiminahs the stipules are generally narrow and often absent.
In -S".
stipiilaris, Sm., the broad-pointed stipules almost, if they do not (pntc, 
eqiud the petiole.
In S.
Sniithlaua, E.
Bot., tlie stipules are narrow 
lunate; the leaves ovate, elongato-lanceolate.
In -S".
Siuilhiaini, VVilld., 
the leaves are more oblong ; the stipules broader and the [mbesceuce 
coarser and less silky beneath.
Subsection 3.
Vetrix, Dumort.
i. Caprcfp,.
The nectary is single, the 
peduncle is, I think, not persistent, and the vernation is dilfercnt, 1 bi'lieve, 
from that of the PurpuretB.
In the Purpurefe the young leaves are inllcxcd 
at the margin; whereas, in S.
ciiierea, S.
anrila, L., .S*.
acumiialn, Sm., 
they are distinctly reflexed, especially in the lower half; not so, I suspect, 
iu S.
caprca, L.
The style of S.
actDiiinala, Sm., is much longer than iu 
the other Cinerere.
The style in them is very short, the pedicel veyy 
long.
In the Phylicifolim and Niyrinaides, on the other hand, the style 
and pedicel are both elongated.
The stipules in the Niyricaida are 
usually hirger, more acute and conspicuous than in the hicohres.
In Mr.
Babington's group " vireiites,'" the leaves are far from being always 
smooth ; but the pubescence, though often present on the under si<le, is 
ditterent from that of the Ci/u^rete, and the young leaves are mostly in-

flexed in tlie margin, both in the Phylicifoliff and Nigricantcs ; altlioiigh 
ill S.
Jnchrfioniana, Sm., I have seen the yoniig k-aves partially retlexed, 
as in the Cinereee.
In Vetr'w, excepting- perhaps tiie group IkipJiituhha, 
the pednncle is, I believe, not persistent.

They have a tendency to turn black

I have never seen British specimens of either 8.
romicirini-

In S.
amb'ujua, male, var.
sjjcdhulata, tlie 
nectary is short and somewhat cmarginate.
iii.
Daphiioidi'ce.
In S.
renitlosa, Forbes, tlie scale is pale, rounded, 
fringed ; the nectary suipasses tlie base of the ovarium ; the style is rather 
short, bnt longer tlian the thick, yellowish-green, notched stigmas ; the 
scale has at times a brownish tinge towards the point.
In IS.
glauca, ISm., 
the ovarium is short, ovate, sessile.
The nectary surpasses the base of the 
ovarium and is rather broad and blunt.
Stigmas subsessile and divided.
The style is often short in the forms of S.
ArbuHcnla.
In S.
glauca, Sm., 
the leaves are entire at the margin ; the veins strongly prominent below, 
depressed above.
In S.
Jrbnscnla the colour of the under side of the leaf 
is generally a dnll green, and the stipules are small or absent.
The veins 
are often most conspicuous in the upper surface of the leaf, which pre- 
sents a reticulated appearance to the eye.
In S.
Arbuscula the peduncle 
is, 1 think, persistent.
iv.
Ghrym)ith(V.
The description, leaves broad, roundish, does not 
apply 10 S.
acKtifulia, W., which in haiiit and in other respects bears so 
little resemblance to S.
latiata, L., and S.
Jinstuta, L., that it ought 
surely to be placed in a ditferent section, though I am aware that Fries 
has sanctioned this arrangement from regard to the fructification only.
8. aciitifolia and S.
pomeranica a])pear to bear the same relation to the 
PrcBcoces or SessUes, that S.
alba and aS".
fnigilis do to the Pedunculatfe.
They are the arborescent species in their respective sections.
In S.
Janata 
the nectary is about efpiid to the pedicel ; the scale is very broad, some- 
what membranous in texture below, brown above ; ovary smooth ; style 
about equal to the thick upright stigmas ; scale very villous ; the young 
leaves are not reflexed, and the veins are prominent beneath.
The leaves 
are ciliated at the margin, and are often overspread with a cobweb-like 
jmbescence.
In S.
malifolia the peduncle is, I believe, persistent, and the 
under surface of the leaves is cinereous.
<S'.
lunala and *S'.
mulifolia are 
nearly related, though, as the former has sessile catkins and the latter 
pedunculate, they cannot well be placed together.
In both the stipules 
are conspicuous.
The nectary in 8.
malifolia is rather thick, short, and 
abrupt, and not equal to the smooth pedicel.
The scales are very villous 
and brown above.
The style is longer than the notched and cohering 
stigmas.
Section 3.
Cliamcelyx, Fries.
The nectary in ChanKelyx, so far as I 
have seen, is single in the usual situation, next the axis, but it is some- 
times, though not always, cloven to the base.
i. Myrunites, L.
Catkins at the end of the terminal shoot, or from a 
lateral shoot.
Aments often in appearance like a young Larch cone.
Filaments, anthers, ovaries, stigmas tinged with pale blue or violet.

of the leaves is of a metallic gTeen, bright ami shining.
In the Arhus- 
calre the young shoots are smooth; the stipules generally wanting; 
under surface of the leaves a (lull green.
In Mi/niultes tlie veins of 
the intlexed leaves are more prominent below than above ; vvliere-is in 
the Arhnacnlcd they are often more apparent above than b ilow.
Tlie 
peduncle of 8.
myi'siuiles is leafless towards the base of the amcnt.
'J'he 
serratures in S.
myrsuiUes are more conspicuous and glandular tiinn in 
the ArhHscnlfS.
S. prucumfjei/s, except in size, is very near S.

The nectary is a single, short, thick, blunt, pinkish gland.

Catkins on a leatless stalk, with a leaf opposite and 
a bud between.

iii.
Hcrhaccre.
Peduncles short, bifoliate, with roundish, crenato- 
scrrate, exstipuhito leaves, and axillary buds.
Petiole very short.
Nectary 
probably cloven.
S. Grahaiid, Borr., belongs here, and appears related to S.
rcfiisa, 
especially the form S.
Kitaihalinna, \V.
The heaves are infli;xed when 
young, almost sessile, with shallow rather remote serratures, shiiiiiig al)ove, 
paler beneath, and witii prominent veins on the under side, without sti- 
])ules.
Principal veins nearly parallel, but when held up to the light the 
leaves are seen to be reticulated with veins between.
Nectary single, but 
sometimes cloven.
The Irish Willow, the discovery of which was Te- 
conhul by Dr. Moore in the ' Journal of Botany,' is as nearly as may be 
identical with 8.
Grahnmi, Borr., and is a very interesting addition to our 
flora.
I believe Dr. Moore correctly refers S.
polarU, Forbes, S diet.
Bot.
t. 63, to S.
Grahnmi ; S.
polaris, Wahl., is very different.
In the above remarks I have confined mysc^lf almost eutircly to the 
characters of the sections which Professor Babington gives from the 
writings of Dumortier.
This arrangement may eventually be adopted, 
but the characters appear, as regards the British species, first to need 
some correction.
Mr. Babington considers the British Willows to be a disgrace to our 
flora.
The discrimination of them is really no easy matter, and allowance 
should be made for the inherent difliculty of the subject.
To be under- 
stood, the Willows should be cultivated ami observed at dilferent seasons; 
and a practised eye is more to be relied upon than the characters found 
in books.
This qualification no one ever possessed more perfectly than 
the lamented Mr. Borrer.
To a thorough knowledge of the suliject he 
added the utmost willingness to impart his knowledge to others, and to 
enrich their collections from his abundant store both of specimens and 
living plants.
No botanist ever took a more natural and comprehensive 
view of the genus.
No diff(!rence, however slight, escaped his notice or 
failed to have due weight attacluul to it.
He was one who, as he himself 
expressed it, had no theory to support, but sought only to understand 
nature.
A remark of the learned Fries will fitly conclude these observa- 
tions, which I fear have run on to too great a length, " Charactcres non 
specierum sunt criteria, sed ad species dignosceudas adminicula.
Ex his' 
niodo species agnoscuntur, ex v(!gctationis indole cognosciintur.
. .
. Mine 
Lmujuus in speciebus discernendis non charactcres sed oculorum judiciiipie 
acicm laudat."

RUBUS ADSCITUS, Genev., AND R.
MUTABILIS, Genev.
By T.
R. Archer Briggs.
Throuali the exiiniintitioii of some Continental Rnhi Ijeloiigino- to Mr.
Baker's lierhariuni, I am now able to assert tlie identity of one or two 
well-marked Brambles of the neigliboiirhood of Plymouth, that do not 
come in well under any of the " liabingtoniansie" of the Lond.
Cat., with 
named Continental forms.
The first of these that I shall notice is a 
plant named R.
adscitus by M.
Genevier, evidently of the group TUIi- 
caiiles, which is common in linsliy hedges in low situations, and in damp 
thickets about Plymouth.
It has characters so distinct and well-marked, 
that I cannot see how those adopting- Professor Babington's views can 
hesitate to regard it as a species, or those falling in witli Mr. Baker's ar- 
rangement of the Rubi.
in Hooker's ' Student's Flora,' fail to call it a sub- 
species.
It agrees so exactly both with M.
Genevier's specimens of R.
adscitus, and witli his description of it in " Kssai Monographique snr les 
•Ilnbus (In bassin de la Loire, pp.
116-118, that I give a translation of

very close to R.
afhcitns ; it is distinguished from it by its small panicle 
without large bracts, by its Howers being deep pink within, and by the 
different shape of the leaves of the stem.
Its glabrous carpels separate 
it from R.
riicemosns, and its narrowly acuminate sepals from R.

its small flowers, of a bright pink within, distinguish it from these three 
species." 
The above description does so well for the Plymouth plant, aiireeing 
with it even as to the colour of the different parts of the flower, that [ 
feel it to be quite unnecessary to draw up another from local examples.
Moreover, the fine French specimens of R.
adscitns in Mr. Baker's Iku*- 
barium, from M.
Genevier iiimsclf, have enabled me to carefully compare 
the two plants, and I without hesitation assert their identity.
A. reference to " British Rubi" shows that Prol'essor Babinuton con- 
siders R.
adacUun, Genev., and R.
c/c-ras/ts, Midi., the same, placing both, 
under the latter of these names, as a variety of R.
viUicaidis.
He, iiowever, 
expresses a (h)ubt as to the correctn(!ss of this arrangcnumt on the ground 
of the possibility of R.
dcrasus being a distinct species IVom ll.viUicnidis.
Judging from the s|)ecimen of R.
derdaiiH, Mull., fide Genevier, in Mr, 
Baker's herbarium, I do not consider it and R.
ndscitiifs the same, and a 
note by Mr. Warren, placed with the former, confirms me in this view, as 
it says " near Bellitrdi." , 
The most nuu-ked features of R.
adscU/is are its narrow, sharp, nearly 
straight prickles, its broadly oval, irregularly and de(;ply cut leaves ; its 
long, flexuose flowering shoots ; its broad, often cylindrical, panicle, with 
very blunt end, and long brandies, each dividing near the toj), at a con- 
siderable distance from the rachis, and having its terminal ilower-stalk 
shorter than the lateral ones.
The long, narrow points of the sepals,

large light pink petals, and grevish-green hue of the whole plant are also 
remarkable.
Til is J^ ramble is common and widely distributed about Plymouth, and

Mr. Bdker's herbaiinm contains a genuine specimen of the Riihiis

The points of diflerence between 
these two Brambles seem to me very considerable, and I regard the Ply- 
mouth one as much nearer the R.
uiiitaliiJis of Genevier.
It so greatly 
rcsendjles this that I shall give a translation of M.
Genevier's account of 
it, for comparison with a description of the English plant, and afterwards 
notice the points of dissimilarity between specimens of the two; those of 
R. iniitnhilis, trom Genevier himself, in IMr. Baker's herbarium; those of 
the other in my own.

certainly the position of the Plymouth plant.
The chief points of dif- 
ference "between specimens of the two are that those of R.
mniaklis i\re 
more setaceous, but less aciculate on the barren stems, the termmal 
leaflets are more frequently narrowed at the base, though occasionally 
they have the ovate form" usual in the Plymouth plant.
The leaves 
are, as a rule, larger, apparently flatter, more felted and less hairy be- 
neath, but in the latter respect' the foreign specimens vary considerably 
from each other.
The panicle of B.
mutahilis is less corymbose, rigid, 
and dense at the top ; its sepals are considerably more setaceous ; mid 
its petals, as is still apparent on some of the specimens, are bright pink, 
whilst those of the other are white.
The above differences would probably make Continental botanists un- 
willing to join the two plants together ; but I think most British ones, 
had they the specimens before them that I now have, would join with me 
in the conclusion that the Plymouth plant is R.
midabilis, Genevier.
Although spread over a considerable tract of country about Plymouth, 
and abundant in some spots, it yet must be considered local, as it is 
entirely absent from some districts", and has not yet been seen by me in 
Cornwall.
To the stations given for it by the Rev. A.
Bloxam in the 
article referred to above, I can now add the following : — 
In the tract of country drained by the Plym.
— Lower Mount Gould; 
Efford Lane ; Underwood ; near Herdwick Farm, Plyrapton ; between 
Newuhara and Crownhill Down; by Bickleigh Down, and elsewhere 
about Bickleigh.

and Tavistock, about eleven miles from the former place.

SHORT NOTES AND QUERIES.
Botanical Terms.
— There exists among English descriptive bota- 
nists some discrepancy as to the meaning of certain common terms used 
to express tiie outline' of leaves.
The terms in question are ' lanceolate,* 
' oval,' ' elliptic,' and ' oblong.' The conditions defined by the use of 
these'terms are the relative proportion of length and breadth, and certain 
forms of the base and apex.
With reference to ' lanceolate,' the defini- 
tions given by our leading systematists agree as to the proportion of 
length to breadth, that the latter must not be in greater proportion to 
the former than as 1 to 3 : but whilst some define the two extremities as 
tapering equally, others require that the base shall be broader than the 
apex, the leaf thus having a narrowly ovate form.
The definition in 
Professor Oliver's ' Lessons,' and in the introduction to the series of 
Colonial Floras, also given in Mr. Bentham's ' Handbook,' is this latter 
one ; whilst the late Professor Lindley, and the text-books chiefly in use 
in this country (Dr. Masters', Prof.
Bentley's) give the former.
In the 
practice, however, of botanists the use of this term is by no means so 
strict as their definitions.
As to the other three terms, none are defined 
in the introduction to the Colonial Floras, where it is simply said that

Prepare cast-iron label-holders with a flattened spike to keep 
them straight in the ground, and with the upper expanded portion so 
contrived as to have a sunk flat space about a quarter of an inch deep, 
and the right size for the reception of the printed label and its protective 
glass cover.
Paint this sunk space with several coats of good white 
paint, and allow it to dry thoroughly.
The next step is to unite the 
label to the glass plate witli paraffin.
The paper-label and the glass be- 
ing cut to the same size, the latter is cleaned and kept hot, — about as hot 
as boiling water, — while the label is being dipped into a bath of melted 
paraffin.
The label is then cpiickly pressed on to the hot glass, a board 
and a weight being put upon both.
When cold, the glass with its 
adherent label is placed in the sunk space of the label-holder, and 
secured with good putty.
Subsequently, a coat or two of paint on this 
putty will keep all secure.
The above directions are much easier to 
carry out than they appear to be at first sight, while several contrivances 
and precautions will suggest themselves to any one who carries them out 
on a large scale.
For instance, the glass plates may be kept hot in an 
oven, and removed with a pair of crucible tongs as wanted, while another 
pair of tongs or pincers will be useful to hold the labels during their im- 
mersion in the melted paraffin.
Here it should be stated that the best 
paraffin is that which is freest from any kind of fat or grease, and melts 
at a temperature at least above 56° Centigrade.
It might be found 
advisable to imbed the label and glass in paraffin, or to modify the plan 
of fixing the label to the glass by putting it, soaked in paraffin, between

Note on the Fertilization of Cereals.
— I am not aware of 
any observatioris on the fertilization of cereals.
This year I turned my 
attention to the subject, from being at work on the Grasses for the third 
edition of 'English Botany;' and as my residence is in the midst of corn- 
fields, I had ample op[)ortunities of investigating the subject.
In Wheat 
and Barley the stignuis receive tiie pollen from the anthers before the 
latter are protruded, and the exsertcd anthers 1 found to be always empty.
In the Oat most of the protruded anthers are empty, but occasionally 
finthers with pollen are to be found after protrusion, and sti<>nuis exposed 
at the sides of the florets, which 1 have not been able to tind in AVheat 
and Barley.
All the British forms of the Jgropyrum section of Triticum, 
and Ilordenm murirnim, maritbiium, and bulLosKin. protrude their stigmas 
and unemptied anthers in the manner usual among the EiwyaulhefP.
My observations are contined to the county of Fife, and the case of tlje 
Oat seems to show that the mode of fertilization is not always constant 
in the same species, so that observuiions are required in other places.
The question is more important than it aj)])ears at first sight.

noticed letters in the newspapers from farmers, predicting a bad wheat 
harvest because the " wind had blown ofl' the flowers." Noav, if the

Winter Fertilization.
— In the first number of ' Nature' (for Nov.
4th, 1869), I ventured a hypothesis, founded on a series of observations, 
that plants which flower in the winter have their reproductive organs 
specially arranged to promote self-fertilization.
The following fact seems 
to confirm this theory : — I recently came upon a late-flowering patch of 
Sldluria aqiiatica, Scop., on which the following observations were made 
on two separate occasions, Oct. 21st and 28th.
Plants belonging to the 
Order CaryopJiyllacece are, as a rule, so strongly protandrous (see my 
paper in the ' Journal of Botany' for October, 1870), that cross-fertiliza- 
tion is almost essential.
In the present instance, however, I found in 
almost all the open flowers, of which there were a considerable number, 
the anthers discharging their pollen at the time when the stigma was 
receptive, the stigraatic surfaces being brought into immediate contact 
with the dehiscing anthers in a singular manner.
Of the ten stamens five 
are opposite the petals, while five spring from interpetalar glands.
The 
former rested nearly horizontally on the petals ; the latter, structurally the

exterior row, because alternate with the petals, inclined forwards into the 
centre of the Howers ; and in some instances the five styles were actually 
curled round the stamens in a very singular manner.
In some flowers on 
the same plants, as is the habit with this species, the number of styles 
was reduced to four, or even three; and equally in the case of tliese'un- 
symmetrical flowers three or four of the stamens stand forward from the 
rest, to receive, as it were, the embraces of as many styles.
There were 
quite a number of flowers expanded which presented the above features.

Akrangement for Cross-Ffrtilization of the Flowers of 
ScROPHULARiA NODOSA.-^It is probable that the dichogamy of the flowers 
of Scrophiiloria has been already observed and published ; "but it was new 
to me, until pointed out this season by my assistant Dr. Farlow.
The ar- 
rangement is this : — In the freshly-opened blossom the upper part of the 
style is bent forward so as to bring the stigma now ready for pollen, just 
over the patent lower lip of the corolla ; the anthers, not yet dehiscent, 
are out of sight towards the bottom of the corolla ; the filaments being 
strongly recurved or doubled over.
In the blossom a day or two older, 
the stigma has dried up, the style become flabby, and the filaments have 
straightened so as to bring the four anthers up to the gorge of the corolla 
at the base of the lower bp, just back of the now withering stigma ; the 
transversely dehiscent anthers are now widely open.
The flowers are 
visited by honey-bees, which barely insert their heads into the gorge of the 
flowers ; the chin or throat of the bee, coming into contact with the lower 
lip of the corolla, is necessarily dusted Avith pollen from the older flowers; 
and this pollen, in the passage from flower to flower and plant to plant, is 
inevitably api)lied to the stigma of the freshly-opened flowers, which alone 
is in condition to receive it.
The nectar sought by insects is here secreted 
abundantly by the corolla, at its base on the posterior side, and to some 
extent by the disk which girds the base of the ovary ; the posterior face 
of tlu' scale, which represents the anther of the fifth stamen, is apparently 
glandular, but hardly, if at all, nectariferous.
Bees plunge their proboscis 
to the bottom of the flower.

" On the 
Floral Structure of Impatieus fiiha, Nutt., with special reference to 
the closed self-fertilized flowers," by A.
W. Bennett.
These have been, 
on the whole, well described and drawn by Professor Asa Gray in his 
• Genera of the Plants of the United States,' but the author had ob- 
served one or two additional points.
In the ordinary conspicuous 
flowers self-fertilization is absolutely prevented by a membranous wing 
attached to the staminal tube, which completely covers in the pistil, pre- 
venting the access of pollen, and they seldom bear fruit.
The minute 
closed flowers are far more numerous, and are almost invariably fertilized.
The regular calyx and corolla are thrown off from the pistil in the form of 
a cap, resembling the calyptra of a Moss, which the author suggested is 
caused by the elasticity of the filaments.
The stamens are of an altoge- 
tlier dift'erent construction from those in the conspicuous flowers, entirely 
free, strap-shaped in form and with small anthers, containing a very small 
quantity of pollen.
These never dehisce ; but, as is often the case with 
" cleistogenous " flowers, the pollen grains protrude their tubes while still 
in the anther, piercing its wall to reach the stigma.
The " cleisto- 
genous " flowers are more numerous than the conspicuous ones in the 
proportion of at least twenty to one, and are produced throughout the 
summer synchronously with them, generally on different ]Dlants, occa- 
sionally on dift'erent branches of the same plant, never on the same branch.
The author was unable to detect that the conspicuous flowers are ever 
visited by insects, and the staminal arrangement seemed to promote al)so- 
lute sterdity rather than cross-fertilization.
The paper concluded with 
some observations by Mr. Darwin, generally in accordance with those of 
Mr. Bennett, and especially on the point that the two kinds of flowers are 
distinct from the outset, and that the closed ones are not the result of 
" arrested development," as held by Professor Gray.
The paper was 
illustrated by a series of drawings.
Mr. Beutham referred to the closed 
flowers of Viola, and noticed similar conditions in Ononis minndssima and 
Salvia clandestina ; in the former of these two, the apetalous flowers, 
however, appear before the normal ones.

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES, 377 
Botanical Society of Edin burgh.
— November 2th.
— Alexander 
Bucliaii, M.A., President, iti the chair.
The President delivered an in- 
augural address, of which the following is an abstract : — 
I propose in this address to make some remarks on climate and wea- 
ther relative to the geographical distribution of plants, havini>- recently 
completed certain inquiries regarding prevailing winds and rainfall which 
are so intimately connected with the subject.
In 1847, De Can telle made 
some researches into the causes which limit vegetable species t )wards the 
north in Europe and similar regions, and arrived at the conclusion that 
every species having its northern limit in central or northern Europe ad- 
vances as tar as it finds a certain fixed amount of heat, calculated from 
that day of the year when " a certain mean temperature commences to the 
day when that mean terminates." This law he applied with great inge- 
nuity, in explanation of the northern limit of Ali/ssiim calyclnaai, Euohij- 
mus europcsan, and Blantlius Carihnsianornm.
It is evident that this law 
can be best tested by applying it to the limits of wheat, barley, the vine, 
and other cultivated species, since owing to the care taken of them by 
man in their cultivation, it' may be consideretl that it is climalic condi- 
tions alone which set the limits to their distribution.
According to 
Boussingault, wheat requires 8248° F.
from the time it begins to grow 
in spring for the proper ripening of the crop.; and moreover, this heat 
must be so distributed as to secure a mean temperature of 58° during the 
period when the seed is ripening.
This statement referred to the conti- 
nent of Europe, to which his researches were confined.
But we have 
found in Scotland that a mean temperature of 56° with the average 
amount of rain and sunshine, is sufficient to ripen wheat properly.
Not 
only so, but the crops of 1864 ripened well with a temperature as low as 
54"4 ; in this year, however, the sunshine was much above the average, 
and the mean of the day temperatures was high.
Now whatever be the 
cause, whether the longer day in Scotland, or the clear sky, or bjth com- 
bined, which brings about the above results, it is clear that in co isidering 
the infiuence of temperature on the ripening of plants, it is not merelv 
mean temperature, but the manner in which this vital element is par- 
titioned during the twenty-four hours which must be taken into aci'ount.
Now what most influences the mode in which temperature is dislribntcd 
during the day is the amount of cloud and moisture in the atmosphere, to 
a knowledge of which the rainfall through the months of the year may be 
regarded as furnishing the best available key.
Indeixl, so great is the 
direct and indirect infiuence of moisture on plants, that we shall not be 
far wrong in supposing it to be co-ordinate with that of temp 'ratiire.
De Candolle's researches applied to a region where the climates are de- 
termined rather by variations of temperature than of moisture.
Not the 
least valuable of the results he arrived at in ap])lying the law to other 
regions is this, viz.
" On the borders of the Mediterranean St^a, the limits 
appeared so often determined by the humidity, or by causes still unknown, 
that the operations of temperature always eluded my calculations." In 
the climates of this region the rainfall plays a conspicuous part, and 
hence, as was to have been expected, an assumed climatic limit to species 
which did not include the rainfall, turned out to be inapplicable to the 
facts of distribution.
Again, perennial species, especially trees and shrubs, 
are in many cases arrested, or limited, by the absolutely lowest tempera- 
tures that occur.
The great frost of Christmas 1860 brought us very 
378 PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES.
valuable information bearing on tlie point.
These low temperatures de- 
pend to a great extent, no doubt, on the latitude, but they more par- 
ticularly are determined by the state of the sky and by local situation.
If the climate is characterized by a dry calm atmosphere, the loss of heat 
by radiation during the nights of winter is great, and the temperature 
falls correspondingly low ; and owing to the greater density and conse- 
quent weight of cold air, it flows down the slopes of a country which is 
being cooled down, much in the same way as water, and settles in the 
low-lying situations.
It is well-known that it is in such situations where 
the destructive effects of fro?ts are greatest on vegetable forms.
Now 
what we wish to draw possible atlention to is this:— of the two con- 
ditions, heat and moisttu-e, we have in the distribution of rain a body of 
facts which will lead to a knowledge of the laws which regulate the dis- 
tribution of plants more quickly and more certainly than the facts of the 
distribution of temperature.
It is not merely the daily and annual fluc- 
tuations of the temperature of a climate which may be inferred from a 
knowledge of its humidity ; it is not merely the greater immediate results 
which accrue to plants arising from a change in the humidity than rises 
from a change of temperature ; but what especially concerns the question 
is this vital distinction between the two, viz.
as regards temperature, 
climates range into each .other by comparatively nice gradations, whereas 
on the contrary, the most diverse climates, as respects moisture or dryness, 
are frequently placed sharply side by side.
I have been long impressed 
with the importance of a knowledge of the rainfall viewed in these aspects, 
and have recently constructed thirteen maps, showing for each of the 
months and for the year the rainfall over the greater part of the land of 
the northern hemisphere.
The result of the whole discussion in its rela- 
tion to climate is vtry striking.
Everywhere the rainfall is dependent on 
the prevailing winds and on the configuration of the earth's surface ; and 
since the prevailing winds depend on the distribution of land and water 
over the globe with respect to the heat of the sun, it follows that the pre- 
sent climates of the earth are determined by the relative distribution of 
land and water, and that with a different distribution we should have 
different climates.
Perhaps nowhere on the globe does there exist such 
diversity of climate as in America, west of the Rocky Mountains ; and 
there is also very great diversity in India, the region of the Caucasus, and 
Spain and Portugal.
The United States of America, both the prairie and 
Alleghany regions, British America, the Mediterranean regions, Sweden 
and Norway, and the south and east of Asia, have peculiar and well- 
marked climates.
Not only so, but even in Russia, there are great dif- 
ferences arising from the different way in which the rainfall is partitioned 
through the months, especially from May to August.
Now it is in those 
regions which present climates the most diverse from each other, and 
many of them sharply defined, that the geographical distribution of plants 
may be best studied, because these climates afibrd the conditions best 
suited for tracing the influence of climate in this distribution, and in the 
changes it eflects, or does not effect, on the habits and different organs of 
the plants themselves.
But to develope this part of the subject so as to 
arrive at some really scientific knowledge of the laws regulating the dis- 
tribution of plants, it is absolutely necessary that the confusion in our 
present catalogues of plants be rectified, and that the areas of the distri- 
bution of species be stated with a precision much greater than has hitherto

To eflect these salutary changes, we must in- 
vite tiie aid of Local Natural History Societies ; and botanists will require 
to give their assistance in supplying us witii exhaustive monographs of 
separate genera, or other naturally allied forms.

On the night of November 1st, died, full of years, William Baxter, for- 
merly Curator of the Botanic Garden, Oxford.
Better known to a former 
generation than to the present, Mr. Baxter's reputation as a gardener and 
a botanist has been to the present race a tradition of the past rather than 
a fact of the present.
Mr. Baxter was appointed to the Botanic Garden 
as long ago as 1813, and retired in favour of his son, Mr. W.
H. Baxter, 
the present holder of the office, some twenty years since.
In 1817 he 
was admitted as an Associate of the Linnean Society, and in this present 
niontli he sank to his rest in his eighty-fourth year.
. .
. 
W' lien Mr. Baxter was first appointed to the Botanic Garden, Oxford, 
botany had sunk to its lowest level ; Sherard, Dillenius, and Sibthorp 
belonged to the past.
Dr. Williams, who held the chair in the early part 
of Baxter's curatorship, was an elegant scholar and an amiable man, but 
added nothing to botanical science ; and for practical instruction in 
botany the undergraduates of that day had recourse to the teachings of 
Mr. Baxter.
Among his pupils were many men who subsequently dis- 
tinguished themselves in various ways, and some of whom, such as the 
present Bishop of Chichester, kept up their acquaintance with their 
instructor up to recent times.
It was at this period of his career that 
Mr. Baxter edited his ' British Botany,' a work in several volumes, 
devoted to the description and illustration of British plants.
The illus- 
trations are of unequal merit, but the amount of information accumulated 
is extremely large, and bears witness, not only to great shrewdness of 
perception and accuracy of observation, but to indefatigable zeal and 
labour.
But it was in Cryptogamic botany that Mr. Baxter specially 
excelled, in this proving himself a worthy comjieer of his fellow-labourers, 
Dawson-Turner, Borrer, Burton, and others.
Even to comparatively late 
years Mr. Baxter retained, in a remarkable degree, his knowledge of 
Mosses and Kpiphyllous Fungi, gained at a time when the number of 
students in those departments of botany in this country might be counted 
on the fingers of one band, and acquired before the compound microscope 
had become the valuable instrument it now is.
But Mr. Baxter did not 
allow his botanical pursuits to interfere with his practical duties.
It is 
on record that he made great changes for the better in the garden, raised 
its level so that it was no longer Hooded, and stored it with rare plants 
to an extent that rendered the Oxford Botanic Garden one of the most 
remarkable of its time.

On tlie death of Dr. Williams, in 1834, Dr. Dnubeny was elected to 
the professorship, and immediately proceeded still further to improve, 
and, indeed, remodel the garden.
So eaoer was the Professor to com- 
mence operations, and so anxious was the Curator to carry out his views, 
that, as we have heard, on the very first nii^ht of his appointment, the 
Professor and Curator, lantern in hand, proceeded to the garden, and 
then and there projected much of the alterations that were subsequently 
carried into effect, and which, with modifications introduced by the pre-

many years, has just pidjlished an important paper on the classification of 
the Yucca.
In the first place he makes a new genus, wliich he calls 
Hesperaloe, for a plant first described by Torrey as a doubtful Yucca 
under the specific name of parvifiora, and afterwards by Gray as an Aloe 
under the name of ynccrefolia.
This has entirely the general iiabit of 
Yucca, but ditlers by its perianth-segments joined at the base, and peri- 
gynous not hy|)ogynous filaments.
Considering that Aloe is an exclu- 
sively African genus, nearly restricted to the Cape, this is probably the 
best settlement of the matter.
The genus Yucca, as thus restricted, he 
divides into two subgenera, Eni/ucca and Hesperoyncca, the former witli 
papillose and the latter with smooth filaments.
Hesperoyucca is repre- 
sented only by Y.
JlliippJci of Torrey, a plant only known in England 
by very imperfect herbarium specimens.
Euyucca he divides into three 
groups, founded on the fruit, — Snrcocarpa, with ruminate albumen, and a 
sweet, fleshy fruit like a fig {Y.
baccula, Torrey) ; Clistocarpa, with inde- 
hiscent fruit and entire albumen ; and Chenocarpa, with a three-valved 
septicidal capsule.
Considering how important a character the texture of 
the fruit gives in LUiacere, it is of great interest to find such a range 
here in combination with absolute uniformity in floral structure.
The third volume of Mr. Miers's ' (Contributions to Botany ' contains a 
complete monograph of the siiiandar and extensive Order Menispcrmacere.
The author, who had previously devoted many years of study to the 
investigation of the strnctiUH- of the group, first gave a sketch of his pro- 
posed classification in 1851 in tiie Annals of Nat. Hist., and subse- 
quently in tiie same publication, from 1864 to 1867, published the 
descriptive matter which is now collected into one volume.
No less 
than 63 genera and 337 species are enumerated and minutely described 
with that attention to the less obvious characters of the fruit and seed 
which distinguishes all Mr. Miers's work, and the text is supplemented by 
67 quarto plates, all drawn from specimens by the author iiimself, and 
full of information to botanists.
The volume must be considered one of 
the most important additions to botanical literature lately published.
' 
We are glad to know that the Rev. R.
T. Lowe's 'Manual Flora of 
Madeira ' is in active progress, and that a fourth part, carrying on the 
enumeration to the end of the Lahiatre, will shortly appear.
The fourth part, completing the volume (27th) of the ' Transactions of 
the Linnean Society ' has been issued.
It contains two important 
382 BOTANICAL NEWS.
memoirs in botany, the President's revision of the genus Cassia, and 
Dr. MasUrs's account of the Passijloracea.
Mr. Benthani's paper, 
which was read to the Society more than two and a half years ago, gives 
descrijjtion' of no less than 338 species of Cassia, in spite of the reduc- 
tiou of a large number of names to synonyms.
These are distributed 
under three subgenera well distinguished by their anthers and pods, 
Fistula, Snnia, and Lnsiorhcf/ma.
There is a large instalment of new 
species, chiefly Brazilian.
A very useful appendix — to be imitated, we 
hope, by all monographers — consists of lists of the Cassias in the chief 
published >els of plants, with references to their numbers.
A sketch of the 
distribution of the genus over the globe, viewed from the Darwinian 
stand-point, is prefixed.
Dr. Masters's paper is less occupied with 
technical (i( scriptions of species.
The author has worked up the African 
and Ameiican species (the great bulk of the Order) for the second 
volume of the ' Flora of Tropical Africa,' just published, and the ' Flora 
Brasilieiisis.' Some additional ones are given in the present memoir.
In our report of the reading of the paper (p.
24), we shortly alluded to 
the author's views as to the affinities of the Natural Order, which corre- 
sponds to the tribe Passiporere of the 'Genera Plantarum.' A complete 
catalogue of the genera (11) and species (225) of the group is given, but 
the paper is mainly composed of an account of the organography, mor- 
phology, and affinities of Passion-flowers, with interesting notes on their 
fertilization and distribution.
In ' Gardeners' Chronicle' for October 21 is a woodcut and description 
by Mr. Baker of an interesting new Saxifrage, of the Dactyloides group, 
called S.
Maweana.
It was discovered by Mr. George Maw, in tiie 
neighbourhood of Tetuan, two years ago, and introduced by him in a 
liviuj)- state to England, and was gathered again this year by that 
gentleuiati, in company with Dr. Hooker and Mr. Ball.
It has flowers 
as large as S.
granulate, and copious buds in the axils of the leaves, 
which are three-lobed only about halfway down.
If it prove quite 
hardy, it is likely, from its fine flowers, to become a great favourite for 
rockwork.
On August 31st the Worcester Naturalists' Club made an excursion 
to Broadwas, and visited Knightwick.
Near the church stands an Oak 
with Mistletoe growing on it, the only one known in Woi'cestershire, and 
making the thirteenth in England.
The tree is of moderate size, and 
probably not more than one hunch'ed years old.
At a meeting of the Winchester and Hampshire Scientific Society on 
October 16th, the President, Rev. C.
A. Johns, exhibited a specimen of 
Monzima polifolia, gathered by a lady at Bitterne, near Southampton.
Mr. Johns had seen the plant growing, but did not venture to pronounce 
it indigenous on the waste ground where it occurred.
The third fasciculus of the Rev. J.
E. Leefe's ' Salictura Exsiccatum' is 
all but completed, and the author is preparing the fourth fascicle.
We hear, through the 'Gardeners' Chronicle,' that Dr. Hooker has 
placed the Lichens collected during his Morocco expedition in the hands 
of the Rev. W.
A. Leighton, for examination and determination.
The publication is announced of a new periodical devoted to Hor- 
BOTANICAL NEWS.

ticultiire, to be called ' The Garden,' under the editorship of Mr. W.
Kobiuson.
Priiicipal Dawson's paper on the " Fossil Plants of the Devonian and 
Upper Silurian Formations of Canada," wliich was read last year before 
the Roval Society, and an abstract of which was publislied in their " Pro- 
ceedings," has been issued entire, in the form of a Report by the Geolo- 
p^ical Survey of Canada.
The memoir is illustrated by 20 plates, and 
describes no less than 120 " species" of plants older than the Carboni- 
ferous period.
Dr. Lindberg, of Helsino^fors, has published in tlie tenth volume of the 
' Acta Sooietatis 8cienti;e Fennicaj,' a critical version of all the Mosses 
that have been figured in the ' Flora Danica.' 
The Council of the Royal Society has awarded one of the Roval medals 
to Dr. John Steidiouse, F.R.S., whose researches on the acids of Lichens 
have been more than once alluded to in our pages.
Mr. Weir is distributing the sets of Mosses gathered by him in South 
America, chiefly in Brazil and New Granada, authentically named bv Mr.
Mitten according to his enumeration, published in the Journal of the 
Linnean Society.
The highest set runs up to 400 numbers.
Several 
sets are for disposal, and any of our readers who wish to subscribe should 
communicate at once with Mr. Weir, Hadley High Stone, Barnet 
Herts.
On Thursday, November 16, Mr. Raker gave a lecture on Agricultural 
Weeds, at the Pul)lic Hall, Ucigate, to the members of the Hohnesdale 
Natural History Club and Reigate Mechanics' Institute.
We extract from the ' Daily News' llie following case of poisoniui;- bv 
Fungi:— "The Rev. W.
F. Welch, vicar of Stadsett, Norfolk, has "dieil 
under painful circumstances.
He found some Fungi by the side of the 
Tiietford Road, which he presumed was (!) eatable.
He gave some to a 
Miss (jibbs, and took some home himself.
On the following day both 
Miss (iil)bs and the rev.
gentleman ate some of the Fungi, and in" a few 
hours they were seized with vomiting.
Mr. Welch appeared for a time 
to revive, but dangerous symptoms again presented themselves, and after 
a few hours of renewed suil'i-ring he died.
Miss Gibbs is recoveriiif." 
In our third volume (p.
28) will be found a notice of the raising of a 
heavy slab of paving-stone in the Goswell Road by a large mass of 
Agaricun (TrichoJoma) cartUngl tints.
Bull.
The same species lias been re- 
cently performing tlie same feat in Whitehall Gardens.
Mr. D.
Woostcr 
our informant, says, " I had several times noticed that the flagstones were 
being raised by something from beneath, and on the 13th of October I 
found three men engaged in taking up the raised flags, when masses of 
the Agaric were discovered to be the cause of the u])heaval.
Some of the 
flags raised were of good size, and must be of considerable weight." We 
may add that the Aicaricus had developed its gills and fructiflcafiftn, 
whilst the plant in the (ioswell Road was but a mass of mycelium.
In the third part of volume thirteen of the ' Nouveanx Memoires de la 
Societe imperiale des Nat. de Moscou,' M.
Kauft'mann has publislied an 
account of the Sumbul root of Persia.
This has been for some time 
known to be the produce of some umbelliferous plant.
A living root has

been obtained at Moscow, and has now produced flowei's and fruit in the 
botanical gardens there.
M. Kauffmann considers it the type of a new 
genus, whicli he has named Eiiryangium, tlie pUmt he names E.
Sumbul.
The paper is illustrated by two folio plates.
