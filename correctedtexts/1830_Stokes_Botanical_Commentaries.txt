" The sciences thus extended exceed/* says a cele- 
brated mathematician, " (he faculties of an individual.
Their immense sphere can be embraced only by a great 
literary body, which in its totality as in avast sensoriuin 
unites all conceptions, all views, all thoughts, which feels 
neither the infirmities of human nature nor the decay 
of the senses nor old age, but ever young ever activ 
incessantly investigates the properties of bodies, discovers 
the powers which lie concealed in them and presents 
them to man prepared for use." "Mais ainsi etenduesles 
sciences excedent les facultes d'un seul homme.

grand corps literaire qui dans son ensemble, comme dans

Literary societies possess the means of pursuing many

which individuals cannot.

employing a society in a philosophical enquiry, but the 
benefits arising from their activ cooperation in their 
endeavours to ascertain the figure of the earth, are a 
demonstration that when they act in a body they do not 
cease to be philosophers.
Many objects of enquiry present themselves to the 
minds of individuals which they do not pursue from the 
shortness and uncertainty of life or a doubt of continued 
residence.
Who would not wish to know how Lichens 
Fuci Sertulariae and Corals grow, but the Lichen which 
excites the wish grows perhaps on a distant mountain or 
adheres to a mass of rock too large to be portable, and 
if markd some geologist breaks it off with his hammer.
When will some observer resident on the sea shore relate 
the growth of the Fuci which vegetate between high and 
low water mark.
When will some zoologist take lodg- 
ings for a summer at Red Wharf bay near Beaumaris 
in Anglesey to observe in Elliss aquatic microscope the 
growth of Sertulariae.
If a society possessd of a 
garden would invite the travelling botanist to send spe- 
cimens of lichens growing on rock they may be deposited 
in their garden and their dimensions given in their cata- 
logue and their growth become the subject of future his- 
tories.
I have often observd posts and rails in a state 
of decay coverd with Lichen fraxineus and prunastri 
and have wished to know their age.
When will a botanic 
farmer begin with his next wooden fence and mark month 
after month the progress of vegetation til it decays, 
recording the growth of its inhabitants in another 
" journal of a naturalist." 
There is no point on which naturalists are less agreed 
than the nature of species and varieties ; but as our

Let those who cultivate

with specimens in flower and fruit, to compare with the

produce new varieties, and unfold to us some of the 
operations by which the present race of Roses Brambles 
Apples Primulas and Violets may have been produced.
No 
plant affords so many varieties as the apple and pear, their 
varieties being almost equal to the seminal individuals.
What are the causes of so many varieties, pollen ?
soil ?
climate?
grafting?
Plants may be increased in size by 
grafting.
The crimson variety of Rosa semperflorens 
(Chinese Rose) which is a dwarf, probably made so by the 
Chinese gardeuers, rises to the top of the 2nd story of the 
house at Pitmaston near Worcester, as tall as an accom- 
panying plant, of the pink variety, in consequence, as Mr.
Williams informd me, of being grafted on Rosa mos- 
chata.
1 have since seen the 2 varieties growing to the 
same height.
Let it be grafted on the pink variety and 
R. canina.
Plants may be renderd dwarf by grafting.
Pear 
trees grafted on quince stocks are smaller.
A ringd 
branch of the Winter Bergamot pear blossoms earlier 
and loses its leaves sooner than the rest of the branches, 
and its fruit is smaller.
Let a graft of such a branch be 
inserted into a free stock and another into a quince stock.
By the latter method, dwarf fruit trees are probably pro- 
duced.
Let the pink variety of Rosa semperflorens be 
grafted on the crimson.
Mad. de Genlis in her life relates 
that in Suabia she saw roses grafted on apple trees.
Let 
the apple tree be grafted on the rose.
If the seeds of the apples of one tree were sown in dif- 
ferent soils and distant climates we may possibly learn 
what changes soil and climate produce.
A pippin of a 
Nonpareil sown by Mr. Malkin of Chesterfield on grit- 
stone 15 years ago has produced a large shining rosy

produce of the other pippins sown in Herefordshire 
Devonshire Ireland Normandy and New England.
Let 
the trial be made, but let the seeds be the produce of 
flowers coverd with gause to prevent the access of in- 
sects which might convey to the stigmata the pollen of 
some other variety, which may have been the case in Mr.
Malkins experiment.
In experiments where seeds are sown let the soil be 
previously exposed to the heat of an oven that all seeds 
or portions of roots contained in it may be deprived of 
life, and the plants must be ticketted with pieces of lead 
stampt with arabic numerals in a regular series, enterd 
into a journal, and each metallic label fastend to the 
stem of the plant by brass wire.
Every label in a gar- 
den should have a distinct number.
If a plant dies its 
successor should have a new label, and in the book of 
numberd labels it should be stated whence the new plant 
was obtained* 
Another series of experiments is wanted to ascertain 
the best method of restoring to fertility a precious variety 
of fruit become unproductiv.
In my early youth I tasted 
Golden pippin cider from one of the largest casks in a 
cider warehouse, preferable to all the rest, but now the 
fruit is said to be with difficulty obtaind even for the 
desert, and Squash perry more grateful to my palate 
than Champagne is said to be scarcely known beyond 
the county where it is produced.
Mr. Knight considers 
varieties as individuals whose duration is limited, (but 
what is the extreme extent of the life of a bulbousrooted 
plant }) and says that they are approaching to their end, 
and Mr. W.
Salisbury that their sterility is occasiond by 
neglect.
I have attributed it to grafting, alleging that the 
Codlin, one of the oldest of our apples, propagated by

suckers, and our grapes by cuttings are as productiv and 
well tasted as ever, but we have no complaints of degen- 
eracy in peaches nectarins apricots plums and eatable 
pears, though all grafted, perhaps because they are under 
the care of gardeners, whereas the Squash pear Red 
streak and Golden pippin apples ceased to afford a plen- 
tiful supply of cider and perry under the management of 
Herefordshire and Gloucestershire orchadists who stil 
allow mistletoe and lichens to grow undisturbd on the 
branches of un pruned trees.
The fine perry, called Tain- 
ton Squash is however stil sold by the Gloucester cider 
merchants, the bottled 8 years old at about a pound a 
doz.
and the trees which produce it may be seen I am 
told at Tainton about half way between Gloucester and 
May bill, on the road to Newent, probably on red clay.
Good new cider made in the same place sold in 1829 at 
1 s a gallon.
The greater part of the Champagne drunk 
in England is said to be manufacturd from it by French 
wine merchants.
Some fruit trees as the Winesour plum are generally 
barren, but on particular soils abundantly prolific, as at 
Sherborn in the west riding of Yorkshire on magnesian 
limestone, and on argillaceous strata at the foot of chalk in 
the east riding.
Let the orchards where these Golden pip- 
pins Redstreak apples and Squash pears grow be carefully 
ezamind, and if in grass let the soil be ploughed and kept 
in tillage with a succession of manures such as dung lime 
and bone dust, and let grafts be inserted on stocks raised 
from their own pippins and on varieties most nearly al- 
lied to them.
Let the Squash be grafted on every kind 
of perry pear and the Golden pippin on every kind of 
cider apple and on a crabstock, on which Mr. Knowlton 
informs me it acquires red cheeks.
If these expedients 
fail let them be propagated by layers, and planted in the

cestershire Somersetshire Devonshire Normandy Ireland 
and the United States.
The cliraat of the last is so fa- 
vourable to the peach of Persia that their trees are raised 
from the fruit, and grafting little if at all practisd.
If 
countries so distant are equally favourable to the peach, 
others may perhaps prove as propitious to the Squash 
pear Golden pippin and Red streak apples as Hereford- 
shire and Gloucestershire once were.
Mr. Knowlton is 
of opinion that the sterility of some of these varieties is 
owing to their not having been grafted before the trees 
L<et the plants peculiar to the islands of the Atlantic 
be kept in greenhouses and stoves with plants of the 3 
continents of analagous geuera, and also transplanted into 
those continents and the islands of the Pacific, and their 
offspring carefully examind in the hope that new species or 
varieties may be produced.
Seeds afforded by plants 
cultivated in hothouses and greenhouses should be care- 
fully sown, and their offspring compared with the parent 
plants.
No plants growing in the pots or soil should be 
pulled up as weeds unless recognised by the gardener.
There is a plant in Darley garden oonsiderd as a hybrid, 
but if it should produce seeds in the climate where the 
genus grows spontaneously, it may perhaps vindicate its 
claim to the title of species.
Some vegetable races which we call species have lost their 
power of seminal reproduction, as several Alliums and 
Venthae, and Triticum repens.
If the mints and garlics 
are not hybrid productions, let us hope that the skil of 
the experimental gardener may restore to them their ori- 
ginal fertility by destroying their bulbs and confining 
their roots, in which last way Tournefort tells us he 
succeeded with Vinca major figured in fruit in inst.

PREFACE 
Boerhaave in (he Leyden garden confined all the ram- 
pant creepers in pots and if his successors have con- 
tinued the practice it will be desirable to know if what 
were barren have become fertile.
If these means do not 
succeed let us remove them to other climats, which may 
perhaps prove to be their birth place, for the garlics and 
mints with the domestic animals may have accompanied 
man in his migration from warmer climes.
Many questions of importance in this enquiry may be 
best solved in the gardens of individuals who cultivate 
few plants.
Let the Nut and Filberd be planted close 
together that they may intermingle branches, let the 
spikes of one be destroyed one year and those of the other 
another year and let the North Americans make the same 
experiments with the Filberd and their Corylus rostrata.
Let an arboreous European Salix of contemporaneous 
florescence, be planted near every tree of Salix babylonica, 
and let dioecious trees be planted close to analagous plants 
of the opposit sex, Aucuba japonica being accompanied 
by some congener of the male sex.
Seeds of Salix and 
Populus as soon as their oapsules expand must be sown 
in pots and carefully watched and the soil under all these 
trees regularly waterd during the season of fructescence.
Let the cultivator fix upon some species of Rosa of a 
decidedly distinct or very ambiguous charaoter such as 
arvensis canina or villosa, cover a flowering branch with 
a gause bag to exclude insects, sow the seeds and com- 
pare the progress of its offspring in the same situation 
with the parent plant, transplanting others into the most 
elevated situation the neighbourhood may afford, preserv- 
ing specimens of each years growth, and if he reside 
where different soils such as red ground limestone grit- 
stone and schistus are contiguous let plants be cultivated 
in each.

Let mules be bred between Andromeda and Erica and 
between Erica vulgaris and the other Ericas, between 
Antirrhinum Lin aria and its 5 spurrd variety, between 
Antirrhinum Linaria and A.
majus, to ascertain whether 
nature pays the same regard to the number of the divi- 
sions of a capsule and appendages of a corolla as the 
nomenclators.
Many of these questions have possibly been solvd by 
the cultivators of Roses and Pelargouiums, and the Lan- 
cashire weavers, but when gain and prizes instead of the 
love of truth or glory are the incitements to action dis- 
coveries are concealed and die with their inventor.
Our herbariums and cabinets of zoology are very im- 
perfect.
Every one who begins to collect plants should 
resolve to seize every opportunity of gathering a speci- 
men of each plant in fruit as well as flower and also in 
its first leaf, and if the fruit is of such a nature as to be 
inadmissible to an herbarium to place it in a seminarium 
of as easy access as possible.
Circumstances never led 
me to consult that of the Banksian cabinet but the works 
of the Gaertners prove its riches.
It ought to be kep t 
io the same apartment with the plants.
Specimens of phaenogamous plants ferns and fuc 1 
should be of a folio size those of Fungi in quarto and 
mosses in 8vo.
In drying them they may be moderately 
pressd between pink blotting paper by means of large 
books laid upon them.
Hard pressure makes better pic- 
tures but renders them less useful to the student.
In 
travelling I content myself with such whitybrown or cap 
paper as the country grocers furnish.
At home I dry 
the papers on a clothes horse before a raked fire, but in 
an inn I spread them on chairs and tables and on the 
floor, in winter while present in the room hanging them 
on a fender before a fire.

warm I lay each paper with a specimen upon it on the 
floor and let them remain till they begin to fade and then 
lay them one upon another again.
If travelling in any 
kind of carriage I tie them up between pasteboards and 
lay them under the cushions.
Small specimens I put 
into a pocket book and find such better preservd than any 
other.
The seeds and when small the seedvessels, wrapped 
in paper should accompany the dried specimen, the place 
and time where and when gatherd being subjoined to the 
name, with a number corresponding to another enterd 
into a catalogue of the herbarium.
The specimens of herbariums intended for public in- 
spection, such as those of Linnaeus and Banks, are 
generally pasted on paper with corrosiv sublimate in the 
paste, but if the collector intends to use them for the 
purpose of description or future illustration he will keep 
them loose, that they may be examind on both sides, and 
in the microscope.
I have been in the habit of tieing them 
between pasteboards in bundles, and have been so long 
free from the depredations of the brown dermestes, that 
I attribute my security to pressure.
It might be prefer- 
able perhaps to keep them in oblong boxes with one side 
or end falling down by a hinge, pressing them down by a 
plate of cast iron or stone.
Bankss herbarium, if I mis- 
take not, is so constructed that in case of fire it may be 
readily transported.
But our public herbariums should 
be kept in incombustible buildings, which I fear the British 
museum and the house lately occupied by Banks in Soho 
square which contains the Linnaean herbarium, are not

Chatswortb is well defended by 
buckets engines and running water within its wall*.
The 
engines should be played on the festival of the saint to 
whom the parish church is dedicated.
All subjects of natural history should if possible be 
described while recent and by daylight, particularly the 
colour of the corolla and if the collector be an artist a 
colourd sketch should be taken, as the colour of many 
flowers changes during and after drying, particularly 
blues, some changing from reddish purple to blue as 
Campanula pa tula.
Colourd outlines of many Fungi 
should accompany the dried specimens to enable the 
collector more readily to recegnise them.
I exhort all 
naturalists to use the best simple microscopes the opti- 
cians of the day can furnish, as I too frequently feel in 
consulting even good authors that they depended on 
their eyesight, and that sometimes imperfect.
The mi- 
croscopes I have used are Wilsons adapted to Elliss 
aquatic microscope, but I doubt not that improvements 
may be found in the London shops.
Mr. Parker of the 
sand pits in Birmingham has made me a circular fountain 
with upright sides of brass which I find much superior 
to the watch glass of Elliss.
Needles stuck in the 
feather ends of quils are useful in separating minute 
objects, as are pieces of strong flat clear glass to press 
objects between to discover their texture.
A naturalist 
should always study at a south window and in towns not 
forget to have it frequently cleaned.
Every naturalist, indeed every one who can write, 
should keep a journal, on paper folded in an 8vo or 
12mo form, capable of being bound up, written on one 
side, leaving the opposit page open for corrections and 
references.
Each article should be numberd in a regular

series to which at any time an index may be adapted.
This index may be continued from time to time, but to 
prevent unnecessary transcription a moveable index is 
preferable, composed of distinct labels, arranged alpha- 
betically in books.
F ull descriptions of subjects of natural 
history, cases of clients or patients, diseases and reme- 
dies may be on distinct papers and arranged alphabeti- 
cally.
Every naturalist should rise with the sun, making as 
much use as possible of the light of day and not travel- 
ling after dusk, especially in Wales where turnpike roads 
barely admitting 2 carriages, are cut out of the sides of 
hills with an unguarded precipice on one side, the surface 
of the road sloping from the hillside to the brink of the pre- 
cipice, as between Rhayader and Aberystwith.
In France 
and Ireland the maximum of ascent is limited, but in 
the turnpike road from Bala to Llangunog over the 
Berwyn mountains the steepness of the ascent is fright- 
ful.
In Utopia such things are not permitted and he who 
travels in the dark in a carriage without lights is liable to 
forfeit the value of the carriage, and the commissioners 
of roads who neglect to provide for the safety of those 
who travel upon them, are assessd double in the poor 
rates.
In ascending mountains unless in extremely fine wea- 
ther it is prudent to take a guide as mists sometimes 
unexpectedly envellop the top and render the descent 
hazardous.
A long staff armd with a short spike of iron 
is very useful in climbing mountains, and in case of great 
exhaustion lieing down horizontally as recommended by 
the experiencd Saussure will he found very beneficial.
Cold water is the best application to bruises, and is effi-

Take it out without pressure and

out fire or sun.
This is for seven yards of narrow cloth 
which will be reduced } yard.
The great coat must have 2 additional flaps in front, 
made to button, to cover the pommel of the saddle and 
wide side pockets for 2 vasculuras, and if it is desirable 
to carry dried plants an inside pocket of shalloon may 
be contrived to hold a pasteboard case.
If the weather 
be oppressively hot the rider may disengage himself from 
his great coat crossing the arms before him with a single 
knot, without any inconvenience, if care be taken that 
the skirts are not wetted in passing streams of water, 
and if geologist or mineralogist he will be soon sensible 
of the comfort of relieving his shoulders from 2 loaded 
pockets of stones.
Hats and boots are sold which are 
water proof, and there are receipts for making boots 
water proof, or on the approach of wet weather they may 
be greased with tallow and then coverd with blacking.
Whenever the sheets or bed are suspected to be damp 
it is prudent to sleep between the blankets.

ounce or 3 tablespoonfuls of sea water containing 9 grains

If such ablutions shall be 
found to preserve or restore health, long journies to the 
sea may be dispensd with.
I have no opportunity of 
trying it as a pre ser rati v against the fevers of the fenny 
counties as their effluvia have not extended to Derbyshire 
or Worcestershire since 1784 but I should recommend it 
to all exposed to marsh miasmata or the malaria of Italy.
These ablutions as well as the daily use of seawater are 
accompanied by thirst which should be relieved i>y cool 
watery and not by warm spirituous and fermented li- 
quors.
If used as a cold bath the quantity of liquid 
must be more than sufficient to wet the surface.
The affection of the stomach, which too often termi-

Hardy plants cultivated in botanic gardens would not

stream, shelterd from the north and east by a wood or 
plantation lowering clown southwards into a copse, bor- 
derd by a portion of land similar to that of rocky heaths 
and commons.
A certain breadth of the soil of the open 
ground from the top to the bottom of the hill should be 
removed and its place filld by stripes of other soils.
The 
soils most generally acceptable to plants are loam, sandy 
gravel, red clay, decayed basalt encrinitic limestone 
gritstone schistus, lias, and magnesian limestone.
Peat 
mad and sand are the abode of many plants.
Each plant 
should occupy a place as nearly similar as may be to that 
in which it was found growing, and not be plautcd ac- 
cording to a natural or artificial system, which are best 
displayed on paper and in herbariums.
These adventi- 
tious soils in a course of years may demand renewal, and 
the maritim plants in sand occasional sprinklings of 
common salt or rather perhaps seawater.
When the 
nativ soil of a species is uncertain and it does not flou- 
rish and produce seeds plants of it must be set in different 
soils and the event recorded.
The botanist who describes 
the plant found in its nativ place of growth should not 
omit to mention in what soil it grew, and he who de- 
scribes a plant found in a garden should tell us if known 
in what soil it best flourishes.
Millers dictionary is the 
best work on this subject, but some of my gardening 
friends recommend Graeffer as a manual.
The exotics in the stoves of botanic gardens at Euro- 
pean courts, should be arranged geographically, that the 
ambassadors of different nations may have an opportu-

a taste for the study of nature.
Botany is perhaps the 
key destine] to unlock the treasures of Africa, to be ex- 
plored perhaps by Mussulmans educated in a London 
university.
We have descriptions of the rarer plants of a garden 
as the Hortus elthaniensis of Dillenius, and Hortus 
upsaliensis of Linnaeus, catalogues of gardens con- 
sisting of the generic and specific characters of plants 
such as the Hortus kewensis and Boerhaaves index, and 
we have one by a gardener in Millers dictionary, but the 
Hortus or Flora or compound of both, which I wish to 
see, must be the work of one who delights in the con- 
templation of nature, who is perhaps more of a cultiva- 
tor than a botanist, who living in his garden and the 
adjoining fields, and rising with the sun is more intent 
on watching the unfolding of buds, the sleep of leaves, 
the vigils of flowers, the dissemination and germination 
of seeds, and the changes of colour in the leaves in 
autumnal decay, than in dissecting flowers fruits and 
seeds to ascertain the relation in which one plant stands 
with regard to others.
The circumstances described in 
such a Hortus ought to form a part of complete descrip- 
tions, but these are generally written when the plant in 
full beauty attracts the attention of the botanist, eager 
to comprehend its nature by a minute examination of its 
parts.
This Hortus will contain those circumstances in 
the history of plants which the professd botanist is in 
danger of overlooking.
It will record the germination 
of the seed, the form of the seminal leaves, the colour of 
the early shoots of Paeonia and Tradescantia, the 
progress of the stem and foliage of Lilium album which 
begin to fade before the flowers are in full beauty, the 
annual changes of the bulbous rooted plants, the day

evergreen fall almost unnoticd, and the hours when the 
anthodia and eorollae expand and close, when the an the - 
rae shed their pollen, when tbe germ en is distended to 
fullness, when the seedvessel disperses its seeds, when 
the leaves change colour in decay, when they finally fall, 
when the annual becomes lifeless, and the herbaceous 
stem of the perennial and biennial and the shrubby bien- 
nial stem of Rubus idaeus alike die down to the root.
Cabinets of zoology should contain not only tbe skins 
but the skeleton and alimentary canal inflated or iu spirits, 
the different sexes, and in those of birds the 1st 2nd 
in some species the 3rd plumage of each sex.
The skin should be preservd from the depredations 
of moths, by applying to the inside a solution of cor- 
rosiv sublimat by a hair pencil, folding the sides of the 
skin together, in birds placing one wing closed on the 
side of the trunk and the other wing expanded as if fly.

Let those who have time and ability imitate Miss 
Meyrick and Mr. Waterton iu their exquisit prepara- 
tions in living attitudes.
Cabinets of insects should con- 
tain the eggs, the caterpillars, the dung of some, the 
coccoon, the chrysalis, the male the female and the neuters .
In conchology the inhabitant of each shell should accom.
pany it in spirits, and in the class of intestinal vermes 
the worm of each animal should be preservd in a sepa- 
rate phial.
Each specimen should be labelld with a dif- 
ferent number and enterd into a catalogue in which the 
place and time when and where found should be recorded.
Such a cabinet will furnish us with enlarged specific cha- 
racters which may prove even superior to those of plants.

shortest, and the investigating naturalist often receives 
with gratitude illumination from Seopoli Michaux and 
Nilsson amid the obscurity of Linnaean brevity.
The 
few entomologists I have conversd with have appeared 
well satisfied with their leaders and the systems of the 
day, but when I have had occasion to investigate an in- 
sect their specific characters have appeared very inferior 
to those of the botanist.
The true entomologist will not 
confine himself to a cabinet with Fabricius, but study 
the animal in its various forms from the egg to the perfect 
insect with Godaert Swammerdam and Sepp, and his 
specific characters will not be contrasted with those of 
species of which we know nothing except their last 
stage, but with those whose entire history we are more 
or less acquainted with.
If there are no systems for the investigation of cater- 
pillars and crysalises there ought to be.
In Ornithology I have long felt the want of two sys- 
tems one of investigation consisting of the characters of 
birds as they present themselves to us without the infor- 
mation that observation and anatomy may furnish ; the 
other the system of arrangement founded on an exami- 
nation of structure.
The following is a specimen of the 
plan proposed, 
1. System of investigation.

Supra atro plumbeus, subtus ferrugineo al- 
bicio fuscoque mixtus, fasciis ferrugineis cuspidatis.

Mas supra atro-plumbeus subtus al-

culisque cordatis.
â€” Male atrous leadcolourd on the upper 
side, under side a mixture of whitish and ferruginous 
with cuspidate fasciae ; female brown on the upper side, 
a mixture of whitish and brown with cuspidate fasciae 
and cordate spots on the under side.

ing that Adanson in 1783, and M.
Afzelius in 1793, 
informd me that they saw Ilirundo rustica, the former 
near the colony on the river Senegal and the latter at 
Sierra Leone, iu that time of the year when it is absent 
from Europe, Adanson desiring me to let Barriugton 
know that L'Uirondellc was the French name for Hirundo 
rustica.
Mr. Tudsbury of Chesterfield, who resided, at 
Sierra Leone and Rio Nunez from 1821 to 1828 as 
agent to a mercantile house in London, iuforms me 
with English specimens of II.
rustica urbica and Apus 
before him, that it is seen all the year in the neighbour- 
hood of Rio Nunez aud Sierra Leone, but that they are 
less numerous in the raiuy season from June to Sept.
They iuhabit rocks from 80 to 90 miles from the coast, 
flying about rivers and lakes.

on the sea shore.
Neither did he see any nests or eggs.

nests soon after their arrival in CaflYarra, whence he 
says they migrate but whither the people of the country 
are unable to ascertain.
From the above I conclude that 
it is an inhabitant of both extremities of the old conti- 
nent, breeding in the temperat regions, from June to 
Aug. in Europe, and in Sept.
and Oct. at the southern 
extremity of Africa, both sets migrating to the equator 
in the winters of the countries where they breed, their 
migrations corresponding with those of the thrushes of 
Scandinavia.
A dead specimen of Hirnudo Apus was found by 
Tliunberg in a cave in Caffraria on the 28th of Sept.
but it was not seen by Mr. Tudsbury at Rio Nunez, 
whence I conclude that this species, more impatient of 
cold, makes the more central parts of Africa its winter 
abode.
Mr. Tudsbury appeared to be acquainted with 
Hirundo senegalensis as characterised in Linn, a Gmel.

the opportunities they possess of promoting knowledge.
Their publications become so volumnious and so expen- 
siv from their form and wasteful mode of printing, that 
they are seldom found complete except in the public 
libraries of capitals and universities.
Who besides Lin- 
naeus quotes the memoirs of the academy of sciences of 
Paris for the year 1719 for the first application to prac- 
tice of the sexual system by the excellent Vaillant Had 
the academy publisbd his observations as a sequel to the 
institutions of Tournefort the sexual system would 
probably have been unfolded at large to the world long 
before the appearance of the Flora lapponica in 1737.
To the bulk of practical botanists it may be said to be a 
buried treasure, while the 8vos of Linnaeus scatterd over 
naturalists.
Maton and Racketts british conchology

7 and 8 of Linnacan 
transactions would have made more converts to that 
branch of zoology in a distinct portable work, and the 
reader would nave had the advantage of an index in which 
the volumes of the society are deficient.
The advocates 
of things as they are may allege that we have an abridge- 
ment of the phil.
trans, but botanical descriptions do not 
bear abridgement.
The evil here complained of has been somewhat dimi- 
nished by the formation of the Antiquarian Wernerian 
Horticultural Astronomical Medico-botanical Geologi- 
cal Zoological Literary and Asiatic societies and would 
be still further lessend if each of these societies would re- 
publish all the papers in the philosophical transactions 
which belong to their respective departments.

the other hand it has been augmented by the consolidation

of Scotland Ireland Manchester Cambridge and Bom- 
bay, to say nothing of those of our transatlantic breth- 
ren published at Philadelphia and Boston.
The French have an edition of the memoirs of the 
academy of sciences in 12mo, but the most useful plan 
for the diffusion of the knowledge contained in these 
works would be a republication of the papers in 8vo 
in distinct collections on natural philosophy chemistry 
mineralogy geology botany ioology antiquities &c.
to 
be separately subscribed for, only one volume of each 
collection coming out at a time.
If a rich philanthropist were to ask me how he could 
best confer benefits on practical botanists, I should reply 
by reprinting in 8vo the letter-press of the figurers of 
plants such as the Jacquins I/Heritier Linneaus the 
son Desfontaines Rotboll Roxburgh Ruis and Pavon 
Schmidel Schriber, Vahl Willdenow, Fl. lond.

other periodical works.

man booksellers would complete the work they would I 
doubt not be amply remunerated.
The Germans having no national repository publish 
rather in distinct works, in consequence of which their 
discoveries are more widely and usefully and perhaps 
more speedily made known, the titles appearing in the 
journals and half yearly catalogues of Leipsic fair, where- 
as the contents of the different literary societies are now 
seldom if ever given in our scientific journals, as they used 
to be in the Monthly and Analytical Reviews while 
under the conduct of Griffith and Johnson, and that 
good practice has not been revived in the otherwise 
excellent work the Bulletin des sciences.

xxvjr.
A museum ought to form a part of the establishment 
of every nobleman and wealthy commoner, of the palaces 
of our bishops, of our cathedrals and academies of catho- 
lics and dissenters, as receptacles of books manuscripts 
coins inscriptions minerals plants animals, in a word of 
every thing that tends to illustrate the history of nature 
and of man.
A chaplain or curator should be ready to 
facilitate the pursuits of those who are desirous of know- 
ledge.
The British museum is the best place for the 
study of natural history for those who are obliged by 
other causes to reside in town, but London is too dear a 
place for a mere student, on which account it ought not 
to have been chosen as the seat of our 2 new universi- 
ties.
If the admirers of Willdenow unacquainted with Ger- 
man are thankful for the translation of the preface to the 
supplement to the Enumeratio of which I obtained a 
literal version from a friend, I ask them in return to pro- 
mote English versions of German prefaces to Latin 
works such as those of Suter ab Hegetschweiler and 
Spenner, and of botanic travels such as those of Linnaeus 
and Loefling.

to be 
more agreeable to facts.
Deciduous, perennial and permanent.
Deciduous 
leaves remain for about 6 months, as those of decidu- 
ous trees, perennial for a year as those of evergreens ; 
permanent as those which become a part of the bark, 
falling off only with portions of the branches as Thuia 
and Cupressus.

lower the earth.

The face of a leaf is

The back is the lower surface * 
opposit to the face, and is mostly paler.
The reverse is 
the case in Iris cepi folia.
In Juuiperus communis the 
back is green and the face glaucous.
In vertical leaves the 2 sides are similar and at right 
angles with the stem and branches.
In Viscum album both surfaces are similar.

In 
Allium Cepa the corculum lengthens becoming green, 
the end remaining in the perisperm, which last gradu- 
ally becomes soft and juicy, and may possibly afford 
nourishment to the end of the first leaf.
About the time 
that the tunic and perisperm fall off, the point of the 
second leaf makes its appearance at the end of the 
sheath of the first leaf, by which the second leaf is 
enveloped.
In the Gramina the shoot lengthens at the 
base, throwing out a little above its junction with the 
rostellum a root on each side which shoot downwards, 
above which it throws up a long straight leaf, through 
whose vagiuant transparent base are seen smaller

Number of parts in organised bodies is perhaps to 
be preferrd in classification to shape and proportion, 
making due allowance for duplicates moieties absence 
of a certain proportion of the complement of numbers 
and occasional coalescence of parts.
2 is the pre- 
vailing number in animals, 5 in plants, and so common 
in calyx that to mention it is as superfluous as to de- 
scribe the calyx and germen as green, bearing at the

7 Nov. 17.
Described as naked in the order Gymnospermia of 
the class Didynamia and the anthodial Mowers of the 
class Syngenesia.
They appear seeds in Ajuga distichn.
Obs. 10182, but in most others which I have cxanoind 
they seem to be monospermous capsules.
Those of 
Teucrium betonicum are villose, which rather inclines 
one to the opinion that what we there call a seed is a 
close capsule, 20 Mar. 17, and in Bidens pilosa Obs.
10214, the seed has two membranaceous integuments, 
the tunic lineate and the indusium obscurely reticulate, 
besides the crustaceous covering which I call a cap- 
sule not opening.
Capsules and calyces are often nervosc, but I do not m 
recollect any instance in which the tunic of a seed is 
so, except in Scabiosa bidens Obs. 10093, where it ?s 
uuinquenervose.
Ribs are discernible in the fruit of 
Salvia Verbenaca.
10 May 16, and in Polygonum Fago- 
pyrum the valves are costate with obsolete ribs parallel 
to the costa and margins.
These circumstances favour 
the opinion that they are not seeds but close capsules.
The kernels are veined in Quercus Robur.

When the girth of a long body is at an equal distance 
from its axis, but its girths taken at different distances 
unequal.
Such a body may be levigate striate sulcate 
and angular.
I have long been in the habit of making 
a distinction between teres and cylindricus, concerting 
that Linnaeus used the term teres to express the an.
nular roundness of a long substance though not of the 
same thickness throughout its length, as in a rolling 
pin used in pastry, and cylindricus where the body is 
of the same diameter throughout as in a rolling stone.
A stem may be teres attenuatus but not cylindricus at- 
tenuatus.
I have imagind that I have found these terms 
so employed in the practical works of Linnaeus.

TRANSLATION OF THE GERMAN PREFACE 
TO THE SUPPLEMENT 
TO WILLDENOWS ENUMERATIO.
The Enumeratio plantarum publishd by the never to 
be forgotten Willdenow, contains a list of the plants 
growing in the Botanic garden in the summer of 1808, 
amounting to 6351, a number which must appear as- 
tonishing to those who are acquainted with the earlier 
condition of the garden and the diHiculties attendant 
on the acquisition of so large a collection.
When Will- 
denow in the summer of 1801 undertook the charge of 
this establishment, the garden contained not more than 
1200 species indigenous and culinary vegetables in- 
clusive.
Every thing was wanted requisit for the cul- 
ture of foreign plants, there not being a single stove 
to shelter the natives of tropical climates.
In a short 
time every thing was procured.
Willdenows zeal for 
science and indefatigable activity overcoming all diffi- 
culties the garden was soon brought into full culture.
Stoves were built to receive the plants of different cli- 
mates and communications opend with nurserymen 
botanists and distinguishd travellers, and no means 
left unemployd to bring together living plants from all 
parts of the globe.
A careful employment of the various 
modes of culture enabled him to keep up an aetiv ex- 
change with other horticultural establishments, the 
garden soon containing within itself an inexhaustible 
spring capable of increasing its riches at an inconsi- 
derable ex pence, obtaining plants which otherwise must 
have been procured from nurserymen at very high 
prices, and which before had not been seen in gardens, 
and completing the series of many remarkable genera, 
such as Mesembryanthes Stapelia Narcissus Aster &c.
Nothing enables us to display the specific differences 
of plants, the true foundation of botany, so much as 
the opportunity of comparing a number of living

and afterwards the character of the genus Cactus.
In a journey through Germany Italy France Holland 
the Swiss Alps and the sea coasts of Europe he took 
every opportunity of transmitting to the botanic garden 
all the rare and undescribed plants which occurrd, en- 
couraging all his friends to similar exertions.
His rich 
herbarium supplied him with many seeds which afforded 
plants the produce of remote countries visited by 
travellers perhaps only once in a century, and he was 
particularly fortunate in his trials with the seeds of 
Filices in which his herbarium was peculiarly rich.
See his treatise on the germination of ferns in the Mag.
des Ges. natf.
Fr. II Jahrg.
p. 290.
The seeds of ferns 
found in herbariums have been seldom made to germi- 
nate, and the difficulty of raising plants from them is 
much increased by cryptogamous weeds which make 
their appearance in the pots, such as mosses Mar.
chantias and young plants of ferns either wild or 
growing in the garden.
In this way were obtained 
several remarkable vegetable forms which had never 
been seen in gardens.
The interruption which the culture of the plants 
sufferd from the neglect of the former gardener was 
amply compensated by the conduct of the present M.
Otto, a young man full of zeal for botany and horti- 
culture and who seems to live only for the preservation 
and increase of the treasures committed to his care, 
animated by a desire to anticipate the wishes of one 
who was not only his director hut instructor and pa- 
rental friend.
May the successor of Willdenow follow 
his example in cherishing this excellent man.
Immediately after the publication of the enumeratio 
another calamity befell the garden.
I was in it with 
my friend Willdenow when it happend.
In the report 
which he gave in to the academy of sciences in 1809 
he relates the circumstance.
"On the 2nd of June during very hot suffocating 
weather a hailstorm arose from the west about 4 in the 
afternoon.
The cloud separated, one part passing over 
Berlin in a southeasterly direction, the other in a

northwesterly direction over the park and Moabit.
The hailstones were pearshaped of the size of small 
walnuts.
I was myself an eyewitness of the devastation 
caused by these masses of ice.
A few moments previous 
every thing in the garden was in full beauty, most of 
the 6hrubs being in flower, and soon after all the her- 
baceous plants were laid flat on the grouud, and the 
walks strewed with leaves and broken branches of 
trees.
The glass of the stoves was shatterd into a 
thousand pieces, which tore the branches of the tender 
tropical plants destroying what had escaped the bail* 
The ground coverd with hailstones and white as in 
winter, being warmed by the heat of the day, smoked 
like a furnace, so that in a few moments this scene of 
destruction was enveloped in a thick cloud, the site 
only remaining, every thing else having become a prey 
to the storm.
Several of the labourers were hurt." 
But this loss was soon replaced, bis majesty sup- 
plying funds for the repair of the glass, and warm 
weather setting in prevented the more tender plants 
from farther injury though they were some days un- 
coverd, and many shrubs which seemed utterly de- 
stroyed put out healthy shoots, flowering for the most 
part a second time.
Besides the progressive increase of the number of 
plants, the garden was improved from year to year in 
its internal regulations, stoves being erected on a new 
construction, a separat inclosure foruid for hardy 
shrubs and trees, each perennial plant set in an appro- 
priate plot, due regard being paid to its situation, and 
every plant markd with its systematic name burnt in 
porcelain.
In consequence of these and other excellent 
regulations the garden began to enter into competition 
with the most celebrated with respect to the number of 
species, apparently approaching to perfection, when on 
the 10th of July it became as it were an orphan, by the 
death of its director.
Willdenow in the preceding winter had made prepa- 
rations for publishing a supplementary volume, for 
which purpose he subjected the garden to a careful 
revision marking those plants which had been lately 
introduced, and in the spring he employed himself in

a more accurate examination of the new species.
Ac- 
cording to the last catalogue the garden had received 
an increase of 1350 species.
I felt it therefore a duty 
to collect every thing amongst his papers relating to 
the subject, and to communicate to the lovers of botany 
the following specific characters and descriptions, the 
last labours of the excellent man whom death bath 
taken from us.

| inch long ; valves ovate, recurvate, septiferous.
Seeds roundish, pinkish rufous, one tenth of an inch 
long, microscopically pubescent, from about 6 to 8, in 
2 rows in each celL Hilum orbicular, rugose, with a 
chorazal cord running along one side of the seed to the 
end.
Perisperm globular, carnoso-corneous, white

appears, from the lower end of which bulb radicles 
snoot downwards, while from the upper end of the 
bulb a leaf shoots upwards.
This shoot is covered by 
a rind of the same colour.
The central part is whitish 
fleshy and juicy near the seed, but becomes ferruginous, 
and less juicy towards the bulb, appearing like a 
hractea at the base of the bulb.
The tough perisperm 
becomes fleshy brittle and juicy, consisting of granules 
and a colourless fluid.
