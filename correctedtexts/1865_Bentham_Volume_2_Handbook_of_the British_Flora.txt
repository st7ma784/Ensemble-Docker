CAMPANULA FAMILY.
CAMPANULACE^].
Herbs, with alternate, entire or toothed leaves, without sti- 
pules ; the flowers most commonly blue or white, either distinct, 
or collected into heads with a general involucre.
Calyx adhering 
to the ovary, with a free border of 5 teeth or lobes, sometimes 
very narrow and almost reduced to bristles.
Corolla inserted 
within the lobes of the calyx, regular or irregular, with 5 teeth or 
lobes.
Stamens 5, inserted within the corolla at its base, but 
otherwise free from it.
Anthers distinct, or rarely cohering in 
a ring round the style.
Style single, with an entire or divided 
stigma.
\ Ovary and capsule inferior, divided into from 2 to 5 
cells, with several seeds in each (or, in a very few exotic species, 
reduced to one seed).
A rather large family, widely spread over the temperate regions of 
both hemispheres, especially the northern one, and crossing the tropics 
chiefly in mountainous districts.
The insertion of the stamens within 
the base of the corolla, and not upon its tube, is peculiar, among British 
Monopetals, to this Order and to the Heath family ; and from the latter, 
Camjpanulacece are easily known by their herbaceous stems, and the 
number of stamens always equal to, never double, that of the lobes of 
the corolla.
Corolla very irregular, split open on the upper side.
Anthers 
closely cohering 1.

THE CAMPANULA FAMILY.
The Trachellum cceruleum, a south European plant of early culti- 
vation in our flower-gardens, belongs to the same family ; and the 
Australian Goodenias, Sccevolas, and other allied plants, often seen in 
our greenhouses, form a small family, which may almost be considered 
as a tribe of Campanulacece.
I. LOBELIA.
LOBELIA.
Flowers in terminal racemes, usually leafless or nearly so.
Corolla 
very irregular, more or less cleft on the upper side, with 5 lobes usually 
forming two lips ; the 2 upper lobes smallest, and erect or recurved ; 
the 3 lower ones spreading, and less deeply divided.
Anthers united 
in a tube round the style, often hairy, or the 2 lower ones bearded at 
the top.
A numerous genus, widely spread over the globe, and yet wanting 
in the greater part of the continent of Europe and northern Asia.
Several North American species, with brilliant scarlet or purple flowers, 
as well as Cape or Australian ones with blue flowers, are much culti- 
vated in our gardens.

1. Water Lobelia.
Lobelia Dortmanni, Linn.
(Fig. 604.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 140.) 
An aquatic perennial, with tufts of 
nearly cylindrical, hollow, radical leaves, 
1 to 2 inches long, forming a dense green 
carpet at the bottom of the water, each 
tuft proceeding from a small thick stock, 
with filiform creeping runners.
Flower- 
ing-stems erect and simple, rising about 
6 or 8 inches above the surface of the 
water, almost leafless.
Flowers pale 
blue, 6 or 7 lines long, drooping, in a 
simple, loose terminal raceme.
In the shallow parts of the lakes of 
northern Europe and America.
Com- 
mon in the lakes of Scotland and Ire- 
land, and, in the West of Great Britain, 
descending as far south as Shropshire 
and South Wales.

2. Acrid Lobelia.
Lobelia urens, Linn.
(Fig. 605.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 953.) 
Eootstock perennial, shortly creeping, 
with obovate or oblong radical leaves.
Stems simple or slightly branched, erect, 
1 to 1^ feet high, bearing in the lower 
half lanceolate, slightly toothed leaves, 
and in the upper part a long slender 
raceme of erect, purplish-blue flowers, 
about the size of those of the toater L.
In moist heaths, in western Europe, 
from Andalusia to western and central 
France.
In Britain, only on a common 
near Axminster in Devon, where it has 
been fast disappearing in consequence of 
enclosures, and will probably soon have 
to be expunged from our flora.

JASIONE.
JASIONE.
Flowers blue, in small, terminal, hemispherical heads, surrounded 
by an involucre of several bracts.
Calyx reduced to 5 very narrow, 
slender lobes.
Corolla regular, deeply divided into 5 narrow segments.
Anthers united at the base into a ring round the long club-shaped 
style.
Besides our British species, the genus contains two or three nearly 
allied perennials, chiefly from the mountains of central and southern 
Europe and western Asia.
The flower-heads of this genus show the 
nearest approach to Composites, from which however the many- seeded 
capsules at once distinguish it.
1. Sheep's-bit Jasione.
Jasione montana, Linn.
(Fig. 606.) 
(Eng. Bot.

Root annual or biennial, bearing in the latter case tufts of radical 
leaves which live through winter.
Stems sometimes short and decum- 
bent or ascending, sometimes nearly erect, a foot high, with a few

or less hairy.
Flower- heads, in the Brit- 
ish variety, about half an inch diameter, 
on long terminal peduncles ; theinvolu- 
cral bracts broadly ovate, the flowers of 
florets small, of a rather pale blue, on 
short pedicels.

Corolla when in bud cylindrical and curved, opening more or less into 
5 long linear segments.
Anthers free and distinct.
Style cleft at the 
top into 2 or 3 stigmatic lobes.
Capsules crowned by the spreading 
teeth of the calyx, and bursting at the sides.
A small genus, spread over Europe and Western Asia, but chiefly 
in the great central mountain-chains, ascending to great elevations.
It 
is readily known by the long, curved flower-buds.

A taller and stouter plant than the 
last, with longer and broader leaves, the 
lower ones 2 to 4 inches long and an 
inch or more in breadth, on stalks of 3 
or 4 inches ; the upper ones few, smaller 
and narrower.

CAMPANULA.
CAMPANULA.
Flowers in panicles, racemes, or spikes, sometimes contracted into 
short leafy heads, or rarely solitary.
Corolla regular or nearly so, 
bell-shaped, broadly tubular or rotate, with 5 broad or lanceolate lobes..
Anthers distinct.
Style cleft at the top into 2, 3, or 5 stigmatic lobes.
Capsule crowned by the teeth or lobes of the calyx, and opening 
laterally or at the top.
A numerous genus, widely spread over the globe, chiefly in the 
northern hemisphere or in the mountain-ranges of the hotter regions, 
with a few extratropical southern species.
Taken as a whole, it is a 
natural and readily recognized group, but diversities in the opening of 
the capsule, and several minor points, have induced modern botanists 
to subdivide it into three or more separate genera.
Their characters 
are, however, so little in accord with their general habit, that they 
may be more conveniently considered as sub-genera or sections.
Calyx- tube and capsule long and narrow.
Corolla rotate 
(Specularia) 9.
Corn C.
Calyx-tube short and broad.
Corolla bell-shaped.
Delicate, prostrate plant, with nearly orbicular, an- 
gularly toothed leaves.
Capsule opening at the 
top (Wahlenbergia) 8.
Ivy C.
Stems erect or ascending.
Upper leaves narrow or 
pointed.
Capsule opening at the sides.
Stem-leaves linear or linear-lanceolate, entire or 
nearly so.
Lobes of the corolla as long or nearly as long as 
the tube.
Annual or biennial, with slender spreading 
branches and few flowers.
The corolla rather 
large and very open 6.
Spreading C.
Erect, stiff perennial, with long racemes of rather 
small flowers .
5. Rampion C.
Lobes of the corolla considerably shorter than the 
tube 7.
Harebell C.
Stem-leaves ovate-lanceolate or heart-shaped, and 
toothed.
Flowers two or more together in the upper axils or 
in terminal heads or clusters.
Flowers closely sessile, in compact heads .
. 1.
Clustered C.
Flowers shortly stalked, in rather loose clusters 2.
Nettle-leaved C.
Flowers growing singly in the upper axils or in a 
simple terminal raceme.
Flowers (middle-sized) in a long terminal raceme, 
with short floral leaves 4.
Creeping C.
CAMPANOLACE.E.

Flowers few and large, the lower ones in the axils 
of leaves longer than themselves.
Lower stem-leaves stalked, but tapering at the 
base 3.
Giant C.
Lower stem-leaves stalked, and heart-shaped 
at the base 2.
Nettle-leaved C.
Many species of Campanula have long been favourites in our gar- 
dens for the beauty of their flowers, amongst which the most common 
are the Canterbury-bell (C.
medium), the C.pyramidalis, betoniccefolia, 
garganica, Carpatkica, persiei folia, etc.
The latter species (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2773), very widely distributed over the continent of Europe, 
and northern Asia, and easily maintaining itself w T hen once planted, has 
been inserted in our Floras, but it does not appear to have anywhere 
spread permanently beyond our gardens.
Clustered Campanula.
Campanula glomerata, Linn.
(Fig. 609.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 90.) 
Rootstock short, more or less creeping.
Stem firm, erect, a foot high or rather 
more, and hairy.
Radical and lower 
leaves stalked ; the remainder sessile, 
broadly lanceolate, clasping the stem by 
their cordate base, and roughly hairy.
Flowers sessile, in small clusters in the 
upper leaves, the upper ones forming a 
compact leafy head.
Corolla blue, about 
half an inch long or rather longer.
Cap- 
sules short and broad, crowned by the 
narrow leafy teeth of the calyx, and 
bursting open by small clefts at their 
base.
In rather dry pastures, throughout 
continental Europe and Russian Asia, 
except the extreme north.
Extends over 
the greater part of England, but is ab- 
sent from some of the western counties as 
well as from Ireland, and only pene- 
trates into the south-eastern counties of Scotland.

Linn.
(Fu 
Campanula Trachelium, 
. 610.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 12.) 
A variable species, sometimes ap- 
proaching in appearance the smaller 
specimens of the giant C, sometimes 
with the npper flowers almost contracted 
into a head or cluster like the clustered 
C. Lower leaves on long stalks, al- 
ways broadly heart-shaped and coarsely 
toothed ; the upper ones small and ovate- 
lanceolate.
Flowers large, two or three 
together in short leafy racemes in the 
npper axils or at the summit of the stem, 
or sometimes solitary, as in the giant C; 
the calyx stiffly hairy, with broadly- 
lanceolate segments.
Its stations and geographical range are 
nearly the same as those of the giant C, 
extending all across Eussian Asia, but 
it appears to be more generally diffused 
in western Europe.
It is also more com- 
mon in England, but very doubtfully 
indigenous in Scotland or Ireland.
Fl. summer.

3. Giant Campanula.
Campanula latifolia, Linn.
(Fig. 611.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 302.) 
A tall, handsome species, with nearly simple stems ; the leaves ovate- 
lanceolate, pointed and toothed, often 6 inches long and at least 2 inches 
broad, all narrow at the base, and the lower ones stalked.
Flowers 
large, blue or white, solitary in the axils of the upper leaves, forming 
a leafy raceme, the uppermost exceeding their leaves.
Capsules short, 
crowned by the long-lanceolate calyx-segments, and opening by short 
clefts at the base.
CAMPANULACEA].
513 
In the woods of northern Europe and 
Russian and central Asia, and extend- 
ing to the Arctic regions, but becomes 
rather a mountain plant in southern 
Europe.
Pretty frequent in southern 
Scotland, and northern England, but 
apparently shunning the extreme coun- 
ties at both ends of Great Britain, and a 
very doubtful native of Ireland.
Fl.
Fig. 611.
4. Creeping Campanula.
Campanula rapunculoid.es, Linn.
(Fig. 612.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1369.) 
Rootstock more creeping than in the 
other species, with a simple erect stem 
1 to 2 feet high.
Lower leaves on long 
stalks, and heart-shaped ; the upper ones 
small, ovate-lanceolate.
Flowers droop- 
ing, not so large as in the last two species, 
but varying in size ; they grow singly 
in the axils of small floral leaves, forming 
long, terminal, simple racemes.
Capsules 
nearly globular, crowned by the linear 
or narrow-lanceolate lobes of the calyx, 
and opening by small clefts at the base.
In open woods, in central and southern 
Europe and western Asia.
Having been 
early cultivated in gardens, and when 
once planted in a genial soil becoming 
often difficult of extirpation, it is doubt- 
ful how far it may be indigenous in the 
more northern stations given for it.
In 
Britain, admitted as a native of a few 
localities distantly scattered over England and Scotland, but evidently 
with much doubt.

5. Bampion Campanula.
Campanula Rapunculus, Linn.
(Fig. G13.) 
(Ehg. Bot.

Ramps or Garden Rampion.) 
An erect, stiff, but rather slender 
perennial, more or less covered with stiff 
white hairs, which almost disappear when 
cultivated.
Radical leaves oblong or 
ovate, on long stalks, and slightly cre- 
nate ; the stem-leaves narrow and mostly 
entire.
Flowers small, on short pe- 
duncles, forming long, simple, or slightly 
branched terminal racemes ; the corolla 
divided to about the middle into 5 lan- 
ceolate segments, but not near so large 
nor so open as in the spreading C.
Cap- 
sule short and erect, opening in small 
lateral clefts close under the narrow- 
linear segments of the calyx.
On banks, roadsides, and open pas- 
tures, in central and southern Europe 
to the Caucasus, becoming scarcer fur- 
ther north, and in many places pro- 
bably only escaped from cultivation.
In Britain, it used to be com- 
monly raised in kitchen-gardens for its tuberous roots, and it is uncer- 
tain whether in those localities in southern England, where it is now 
undoubtedly wild, it should be held as a true native or merely esta- 
blished through cultivation.

Radical leaves obovate 
or oblong, and stalked ; the stem ones few, narrow-lanceolate or linear, 
nearly entire.
Flowers few, rather larger than in the Harebell C, in 
a spreading panicle ; the corolla much more open, of a more purplish 
colour, and divided to the middle into 5 broad, pointed lobes.
Cap- 
sule obconical, erect, and opening in short clefts close under the long, 
linear segments of the calyx.

A perennial, with a slender, creeping 
rootstock, often very intricate ; the ra- 
dical leaves, which mostly die away at 
the time of flowering, orbicular or heart- 
shaped ; those of the stem all narrow- 
lanceolate or linear, and entire.
Stems 
ascending or erect, 6 to 18 inches high, 
often branched, with a few elegantly 
droop ingblue flowers, in a loose raceme or 
panicle, or sometimes solitary.
Corolla 
bell-shaped, with 5 broad lobes much 
shorter than the entire part.
Capsule 
ovoid or globular, pendulous, and open- 
ing in short clefts close to the base.
In hilly pastures, on heaths, banks, and 
roadsides, the commonest species in Eu-

A little, graceful, prostrate perennial, 
with very slender, thread-like branches, 
and small, delicate leaves, mostly orbi- 
cular or broadly heart-shaped, with a 
few broad, angular teeth.
Flowers on 
long, filiform peduncles, drooping in the 
bud, nearly erect when fully out, and 
often drooping again as the fruit ripens.
Corolla not half an inch long, narrow- 
bellshaped, of a delicate pale-bluish pur- 
ple.
Capsule almost globular, opening 
in 3 valves at the top between the caly- 
cine teeth, on which account this species 
is placed by modern botanists in the 
genus Wahlenbergia.
In moist, shady pastures, and woods, chiefly along rills and banks.
Abundant in the extreme west of Europe, extending through central 
France, eastward to the E-hine.

THE HEATH FAMILY.
ERICACEAE.
Shrubs, sometimes very low, creeping, and almost herbaceous, 
or occasionally growing into small trees, with entire or toothed 
undivided leaves, and flowers usually drooping, either solitary or 
in small clusters or racemes in the axils of the leaves, or forming 
short terminal, leafy racemes.
Calyx of 4 or 5 divisions, either 
free or with a tube adhering to the ovary.
Corolla inferior or 
superior, usually ovoid or globular, sometimes small and campanu- 
late with 4 or 5 lobes, or (in the two last anomalous genera) with 
4 or 5 nearly distinct petals.
Stamens twice as many, or rarely 
the same in number as the lobes of the corolla, and inserted within 
the corolla but distinct from it ; anthers opening at the top with 
two pores, or (in Monotropd) with transverse valves.
Ovary hav- 
ing usually as many (rarely apparently twice as many) cells as the 
lobes of the corolla.
Fruit a capsule or berry, with one or several 
seeds in each cell ; the seeds very small, with a fleshy albumen.
A large Order, widely spread over the whole world (excepting Aus- 
tralia), especially in the temperate and colder regions, but not uncom- 
mon also in hilly districts within the tropics.
It is distinguished from 
all British Monopetals, except Campa?tulacece, by the insertion of the 
stamens, and from the latter Order by the shrubby habit, the shape of 
the flower, and especially by the anthers opening in 2 small terminal

The Rhododendrons, Azaleas, Kalmias, and other genera of our so- 
called American gardens, belong also to the Heath family, which com- 
prises perhaps more ornamental plants than any other Order.
The 
Ejpacrises and allied plants which, flower in such perfection in our 
greenhouses in early spring, form a closely allied family, which replaces 
the Heaths in Australia.
I. VAOCXNIUM.
VACCINIUM.
Low shrubs, with alternate leaves, and flowers usually solitary, or 
only two or three together.
Calyx with a short tube adhering to the 
ovary, and 4 or 5 small teeth.
Corolla superior, with as many teeth or 
divisions.
Stamens twice as many.
Berry globular, with several 
seeds (or at any rate, several ovules, in the young state) in each cell.
A numerous genus in mountainous districts or boggy heaths, over a 
great part of the globe, now usually considered as forming a distinct 
family, separated from that of the Heaths on account of the inferior 
ovary ; but this character, however important it may be in many cases, 
is, in this instance, very artificial.
Vaccinium has also been divided 
into numerous genera, chiefly according to the form of the corolla ; 
and many of them, including the brilliant Thibaudias, occasionally 
grown in our stoves, must undoubtedly be adopted as such, although 
their characters are as yet far from being settled.
Stems erect or decumbent at the base.

eminently Atlantic.
The greater number of species come from south- 
western Africa, where they extend but very little way to the eastward.
In Europe also Heaths are strictly western, with the exception of two

(Eng. Bot.
t. 1945.) 
Perhaps a mere variety of the com- 
mon W., and sometimes passing almost 
into the larger W.
It differs from the 
former chiefly by the style, which is 
considerably longer, although nearly 
straight, and never so curved as in the 
larger W.
The size of the flower is 
variable.
The geographical range and stations 
are the same as those of the common W., 
but it is not near so common.

4. Common Wintergreen.
Pyrola minor, Linn.
(Fig. 638.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 158 ; and P.
rosea, Eng. Bot.
t. 2543.) 
Stock perennial, slightly creeping, re- 
taining a few leaves during the winter 
intermixed with scales produced at the 
base of each year's shoot.
Leaves on 
rather long stalks, collected three or 
four together in one or two tufts at the 
top of the stock, broadly ovate or orbi- 
cular, rather thick, entire or slightly 
crenated, with a minute tooth or gland 
in each notch, scarcely visible without 
a glass.
Peduncle erect, from 4 or 5 
inches to twice that height, leafless or 
with one or two small scales.
Flowers 
drooping, in a short, loose raceme, not 
turned to one side as in the following 
species, each one in the axil of a small, 
narrow bract.
Sepals short and broad.
Petals ovate or orbicular, quite free, 
but concave and closing over the sta- Fig. 638.

Stamens shorter than the corolla.
Style scarcely protruding or even shorter than the corolla, straight or 
nearly so, with a broad, 5-lobed, spreading stigma.
In woods and moist shady places, in Europe, northern Asia, and the 
extreme north of America, becoming a mountain plant in southern 
Europe and the Caucasus.
Frequent in Scotland, northern England, 
and Ireland, more local in southern England.
FL summer.
5. Serrated Wintergreen.
Pyrola secunda, Linn.
(Fig. G39.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 517.) 
Leaves ovate, more pointed, and often 
more distinctly toothed and more pro- 
minently veined than in the common W.
Flowers smaller, and more numerous 
and crowded, and all remarkably turned 
to one side.
Sepals very small.
Petals 
free, of a greenish-white.
Style long and 
nearly straight.
The geographical range is nearly that 
of the common W., but it is more local, 
and generally more northern or more 
alpine, being rarely found in central and 
southern Europe out of the higher moun- 
tain-ranges.
In Britain, only in Scot- 
land and northern England, and very 
rarely in Ireland.

stem, resembling Broomrapes, and probably parasitical on the roots of 
trees.
Sepals 4 or 5, free or united at the base.
Petals as many, free

minal raceme.
Sepals and petals nearly 
of the same size, ovate or oblong, gla- 
brous or slightly downy inside, persist- 
ing round the capsule.
Anthers small, 
on slender filaments, opening by trans- 
verse valves.
The terminal flower has 
its parts in fours, the lateral ones in fives.
The whole plant is of a pale yellowish- 
brown colour, turning black in drying.
In Fir, Birch, and Beech woods, in 
Europe and all across Russian Asia and 
North America, becoming a mountain 
plant in southern Europe, but extends 
neither to high northern latitudes nor to

Style single, with a capitate stigma.
A widely-spread family, inhabiting chiefly the northern hemisphere, 
and especially high mountains, often at very great elevations.
A few 
species reappear in the Antarctic regions, and even within the tropics, 
but the group is there represented chiefly by the Myrsinacece, which 
scarcely differ, except in their arboreous or shrubby growth.
Both 
these families are chiefly distinguished from other regular-flowered 
Monopetals by the stamens being opposite to, not alternate with, the 
lobes of the corolla.
This character requires some care in observing 
it, especially in those species of Lysimachia which have a deeply di- 
vided, rotate corolla, and the stamens erect in the centre of the flower.

It occurs commonly in three different forms, ori- 
ginally united by Linnaeus under one botanical species, but since his 
days considered by most botanists as so many distinct and constant 
species, although more recent investigation has shown that Linnseus's 
views were correct.
The Polyanthuses of our gardens are cultivated 
varieties of the same species.
The three 
indigenous races are : — 
a. The Primrose (P.
vulgaris, Eng.
Bot. t.
4), Fig. 642.
More or less hairy.
Peduncles apparently all radical, as long 
as the leaves, each bearing a single large 
flower, with a broad flat limb.
Calyx- 
teeth narrow and pointed.
If closely 
examined the peduncles will, however, 
be seen really to spring from an umbel, 
of which the common stalk is so short 
as to be concealed by the base of the 
leaves.
— On hedgebanks and in rather 
open woods ; particularly abundant in 
Britain, and extends over central Eu- 
rope and some mountainous districts of 
southern Europe, wanting in north- 
eastern Europe, and not recorded from 
Fig. 642.

b. The Cowslip (P.
veris, Eng. Bot.
t. 5), Fig. 643.
Not hairy, but often 
covered with a minute, pale down.
Flower- stalks rising above the leaves, 
bearing an umbel of flowers.
Calyx- 
teeth usually broad and obtuse.
Co- 
rolla with a concave or cup-shaped limb, 
very much smaller than in the Primrose, 
but varying in size.
— In rather dry 
meadows and pastures, abundant over 
nearly 'the whole of Europe and Rus- 
sian Asia to the Caucasus and Altai, 
and extending much further over south- 
ern Europe than the other varieties.
Not however an Arctic plant, and, in 
Britain, not so common in Scotland as 
in England.
c. The Oxlip (P.
elatior, Eng. Bot.
t. 513), including all the intermediate 
forms which have the limb of the corolla broader and natter than 
in the Cowslip, but the flowers in an umbel raised above the ground, 
and usually above the leaves, on a common peduncle.
Calyx and 
hairiness partaking sometimes of those of the Primrose, sometimes 
of the Cowslip.
— Usually in moister and more luxuriant meadows and 
pastures than the Cowslip, in less shady situations than the Prim- 
rose, but frequently intermixed with either or with both, and passing 
gradually into one or the other.
Geographical range nearly that of 
the Coivslip, but much less abundant, except in some parts of central 
Europe.

2. Mealy Primrose.
Primula farinosa, Linn.
(Fig. 644.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 6.) 
Stock tufted as in the last, but the leaves much smaller, often not an 
inch long, glabrous above, and usually covered underneath with a white, 
mealy, minute down, also observable on the peduncle and calyx, and 
only disappearing on a few very luxuriant specimens grown in the shade.
Peduncle much larger than the leaves, with a compact umbel of small, 
pale-lilac flowers, with a yellow eye ; the lobes of the corolla rather 
narrow, and deeply notched.
In mountain pastures, in all the great mountain-ranges of Europe 
and Asia, penetrating far into the Arctic regions, and reappearing 
in Antarctic America.
Not uncommon in northern England, and,

In its native country it varies much in foliage, in the precise

in north-western England and south-western Scotland.
It has the 
pedicels usually 1-nowered in the axils of the stem-leaves, the sepals

lour.
The spur is short and obtuse, the 
lobes of the corolla unequal and broad, 
the middle one of the lower lip much 
longer and broader than the two lateral

II.
BLADDERWORT.
UTRICU LABIA.
Some exotic species are marsh plants, either leafless or with entire 
radical leaves and 1-flowered peduncles ; the European ones are all 
floating plants, without real roots at the time of flowering, but with 
long, root-like, capillary branches or rootstocks, all submerged ; their 
leaves divided into short capillary segments, interspersed with little 
bladders or vesicles, full of air.
Flowers in a terminal raceme, on a 
leafless flower-stem arising out of the water from a tuft of the floating 
branches.
Calyx deeply 2-lobed.
Corolla spurred as in Butterwort, 
but the mouth is closed or nearly so by the convex palate, the lobes 
of the lips being turned back.
Capsule globular, opening in 2 valves.
A considerable genus, dispersed over nearly the whole world.
Bladders interspersed with the leaves.
Flowers of a rich yellow, about 6 to 8 lines long.

The root-like floating branches often extend to a length of from 6 
inches to a foot or more, bearing numerous capillary, much divided 
LENTIBULACEjK.
551 
leaves, from J to 1 inch long, and more 
or less interspersed with little green 
vesicles.
Flower-stems 6 to 8 inches 
high, bearing a few rather large, yellow 
flowers.
Bracts at the base of the pe- 
dicels, and lobes of the calyx, broad and 
thin.
Corolla with a short, conical, more 
or less curved spur, and a broad, convex 
palate ; the upper lip very short, scarcely 
projecting beyond the palate ; the lower 
lip much longer, thrown back from the 
palate ; the lateral lobes turned down- 
wards.
In deep pools, and water-channels, in 
Europe, Asia, and America, from the 
Arctic Circle to the tropics.
Widely 
distributed over Britain, although not a 
common plant.
Fl. summer.

2. Lesser Bladderwort.
Utricularia minor, Linn.
(Fig. G60.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 254.) 
Differs chiefly from the common B.
in 
the small size of all its parts.
The float- 
ing branches are very slender, those of the 
flowering plant usually 2 or 3 inches 
long, but when barren often longer, and 
intricately branched ; the leaves small, 
very fine, with few forked lobes, and sel- 
dom more than 1 or 2 bladders to each, 
or often without any.
Elowers scarcely 
more than half the size of those of the 
common B., of a pale yellow, with the 
lower lip much flatter ; the spur usually 
reduced to a short, broad protuberance.
Appears to be as widely spread over 
northern and central Europe, Russian 
Asia, and northern America as the com- 
mon B., but not extending so far to the 
southward.
Rather common in Ireland and Scotland, less 
land.

THE HOLLY FAMILY.
Intermediate Bladderwort.
Utricularia intermedia, 
Hayne.
(Fig. G61.) 
Intermediate in size between the com- 
mon B.
and the lesser B., and distin- 
guished from both by the leaves crowded 
in tufts at the ends of branches without 
bladders, the bladders being few and 
placed at the ends of leafless branches.
Flowers of a pale yellow, larger than in 
the lesser B.
f with a much more promi- 
nent spur.
In central and western Europe, much 
more rare than the preceding species.
In Britain indicated in Dorsetshire, in 
Forfarshire, and in western Ireland.
Fl. summer.
I have not seen it grow- 
ing, and from dried specimens I had 
thought that the British plant so called, 
usually barren, was a variety of the 
lesser B., some of the bladder-bearing 
branches showing a few leaves.
Mr. J.
Carroll, of Cork, informs me however that it flowers abundantly be- 
tween Gralway and Clifden, and cannot be confounded with the lesser 
B., by any one who has seen the plants growing,

THE HOLLY FAMILY.
AQUIFOLIACE^S.
A small Order, widely spread over the globe, limited in Britain 
to a single genus, from which the few exotic ones differ slightly 
in the number of parts of the flower and fruit.
They all nearly 
approach the Oelastrus family, but have the petals usually united 
into a monopetalous corolla, and the stamens inserted on its base, 
without any fleshy disk round the ovary.

ILEX.
Shrubs or trees, with alternate leaves, and small flowers in axillary 
clusters.
Calyx of 4 or rarely 5 small teeth.

Ovary sessile, 4- 
celled, with one pendulous ovule in each cell, and crowned by 4 minute 
sessile stigmas.
Fruit a berry, or rather a small drupe, including 4 
stones or nuts, each containing a single seed.
The species are numerous in the warmer parts of the northern hemi- 
sphere, as well as in the tropics, but reduced to very few in the more 
temperate regions.
1. Common Holly.
Ilex Aquifolium, Linn.
(Fig. 662.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 496.) 
An erect, much branched evergreen 
shrub or bushy tree ; the leaves shortly 
stalked, ovate, thick and shining, some 
quite entire, others much waved, and 
bordered with strong, very prickly, 
coarse teeth.
Flowers white, in dense 
clusters in the axils of the leaves.
Berries 
bright red or yellow.
Common in hedges and woods in 
western and southern Europe, and in 
central Asia, from the Caucasus to the 
Himalaya, but will not bear the win- 
ters of north-eastern Europe or north- 
ern Asia.
Extends all over Britain, ex-

The Snoiv drop -tree (Halesia) from North America, and the Styrax 
from south-eastern Europe and Western Asia, both occasionally to be 
met with in our shrubberies and plantations, belong to the small Styrax 
family, which is entirely exotic.
It consists of trees and shrubs, with 
the calyx often partially adherent to the ovary, the corolla monopeta- 
lous, and stamens, although inserted on the corolla, usually more or 
less united together.

Stamens 2.
Ovary and fruit 2-celled, each cell containing 
1 or 2 seeds.
An Order widely spread over nearly the whole of the globe, readily 
known by the two stamens inserted at the base of the corolla, without 
reference to the number of its divisions.
It is commonly divided into 
two : — the Olive tribe, with the divisions of the corolla 4 or 2, and 
usually valvate in the bud, which comprises the two British genera, as 
well as the Olive (Olea) and the Lilac (Syringa), Filarea (Phillyrea) , 
Chionantkus, and Forsythia of our shrubberies ; and the true Jessamine 
tribe, consisting of Jessamine and some other small exotic genera, 
which have 5 or more divisions to the corolla, overlapping each other 
and obliquely twisted in the bud.
The seeds also have usually a con- 
siderable albumen in the one tribe and little or none in the other, but 
this difference is not constant.

A small genus, limited to the northern hemisphere, without the 
tropics.
1. Common Ash. Fraxinus excelsior, Linn.
(Fig. G63.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1692.) 
A tall, handsome tree, with opposite, deciduous, pinnate leaves, con- 
sisting of from 7 to 11 ovate-lanceolate, toothed segments.
The flowers 
open before the leaves, and appear at first sight like clusters of stamens 
issuing from opposite buds along the last year's shoots, each cluster 
surrounded by a few small, woolly scales.
On examination it will be 
found to consist of a number of pedicels, arranged in a short raceme, 
each pedicel bearing a pair of sessile anthers, with an ovary in the 
middle, ending in a straight style with a thickened stigma.
The cap- 
sules, commonly called keys, are, including the wing, about an inch 
and a half long.

XLVIL PERIWINKLE FAMILY.
APOCYNACE^.
A large tropical Order, distinguished from the Gentian family 
chiefly by the ovary completely divided into 2 cells, or more fre- 
quently into 2 distinct carpels, whilst the style, or at least the 
stigma, is entire.
It is limited in Britain to the single genus PeriivinJde, but is repre- 
sented in our planthouses by the Oleander (Nerium) from southern 
Europe, the Allamandas, Dijoladenias, etc., from South America, Man- 
devilla, and others, from tropical Asia.
The closely allied Asclepias 
family, which is entirely exotic, but includes the Periploca, Stapelias, 
Hoyas, Stephanotus , etc., of our gardens and planthouses, differs chiefly 
in the curious manner in which the anthers are connected with the 
stigma.

VINCA.
Herbs, with opposite, entire leaves, and blue, pink, or white flowers, 
growing singly on axillary peduncles.
Calyx free, deeply divided into

Corolla large, blue ; 
the tube broad, almost bell-shaped, 
though slightly contracted at the mouth ; 
the lobes broad, almost angular.
In woods and shady banks, in south- 
central and southern Europe to the 
Caucasus, but, having been long culti- 
vated for ornament, and spreading with 
great rapidity by its rooting stems, it 
has established itself much further north, 
and is found apparently wild in many 
parts of England, where, however, it sel- 
dom, if ever, ripens its seed.

erect flowering-stems ; in its narrower, ovate or oblong leaves, which 
are perfectly glabrous ; in its smaller flower, with a more open tube 
to the corolla, and shorter and broader segments to the calyx, without 
any hairs.

THE GENTIAN FAMILY.
Its geographical range is more ex- 
tended than that of the greater P., being 
undoubtedly wild much further north-

ERYTHR^A.
Annuals, with pink, or, in some exotic species, pale-yellow flowers, 
differing from Gentian by their more deeply divided calyx, their de- 
ciduous style, their anthers, which become more or less spirally twisted 
after shedding their pollen, and by the capsule in which the seed- 
bearing edges of the valves meet in the centre, so as to divide it more 
completely into 2 cells than in most others of the family.

shire and the Isle of Wight.
Fl. spring.
The British specimens belong to a va- 
riety with narrow leaves, rarely spotted, 
usually distinguished as a species under 
the name of P.
angustifolia (Eng. Bot.
t. 1628), but in many parts of the Conti- 
nent the two forms pass very gradually 
one into the other.
The broad-leaved 
variety, here figured, has been long cul- 
tivated in cottage-gardens, and has 
strayed into adjoining woods in some 
parts of the country.

Changing M.
Some exotic species are cultivated in our flower- gardens, together 
with varieties of the water M., the wood M., and the early M.
1. Water Myosote.
Myosotis palustris, With.
(Fig. 692.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1973.
Forget-me-not.) 
Perennial stock usually slightly creep- 
ing ; the stems weak, ascending, from 6 
to 18 inches high, often nearly glabrous, 
but sometimes rather thickly clothed 
with spreading hairs.
Leaves glabrous 
or with appressed hairs.
Flowers of a 
bright clear blue, with a yellow eye, 
very variable in size, but usually rather 
large for the genus.
Calyx never di- 
vided below the middle, whilst in all 
other British species it is deeply cleft.
In wet ditches, and by the sides of 
streams, in Europe, Russian Asia, and 
northern America, extending into the 
Arctic Circle.
Abundant in Britain.
Fl. the whole summer.
Modern botanists 
divide it into three : the true Forget-me- 
not, which is often nearly glabrous, with a broad flat corolla, and short 
broad teeth to the calyx ; M.
repens (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2703), which 
is more hairy, with narrower lobes to the calyx, reaching to about the 
middle ; and M.
ccespitosa (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2661), with a smaller 
corolla, with the limb often slightly concave : the first is more com- 
mon in the south, the last in the north, but they all three run so 
much one into another as not to be distinguishable with certainty- 
even as varieties.

Fig. 693.
Myosotis sylvatica, Hoffm.
(Fig. 693.) 
t. 2630.
M. rupicola, Eng. Bot.
t. 2559.) 
A perennial, like the water M.
but 
with a more tufted stock, and rather 
roughly hairy.
Calyx cleft nearly to the 
base, with narrow segments, erect when 
in fruit ; its hairs more or less spread- 
ing, and crisped or hooked when seen 
through a lens.
Corolla as large or even 
larger than in the water M., with the 
limb spread out flat.
In mountain pastures and shady situa- 
tions, common in the far north of Eu- 
rope and Asia, as well as in the great 
central chains from the Pyrenees to the 
Caucasus and the Altai.
Not frequent 
in Britain, and perhaps limited to Scot- 
land, the north of England, and Ireland.
Fl. summer.
It varies much in size and 
stature ; in lower shady situations, and 
in our gardens, the stems will attain a 
foot or more in length, with rather small 
flowers.
The alpine form, with larger flowers, is by some distin- 
guished as a species, under the name of M.
alpestris.
3. Field Myosote.
Myosotis arvensis, Roth.
(Eig. 694.) 
(Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2629.) 
An annual or sometimes biennial, with 
a weak stem often above a foot long.
It 
has the hairy foliage and deeply cleft 
calyx of the wood M., but the corolla, 
although variable, is much smaller, with 
a short, concave limb.
Calyx shorter 
than the pedicels or scarcely so long, 
even when in fruit, with narrow seg- 
ments, erect when in fruit.
On hedge-banks, in cultivated ground, 
the edges of woods, and bushy places, 
throughout Europe and central and 
northern Asia, and in North America.
The most common species all over Bri- 
tain.
Fl. all summer and autumn.
Some 
of the larger-flowered specimens are dif- 
ficult to to distinguish in the dried state 
from the smaller-flowered ones of the 
wood M.

4. Early Myosote.
Myosotis collina, Hoffm.
(Tig. 695.) 
(M.
arvensis, Eng. Bot.
t. 2558/ 
A low, much branched, hairy annual, 
seldom attaining 6 inches ; the leaves 
mostly collected in radical tufts, with a 
few at the base of the flowering branch- 
es, which consist chiefly of the slender 
racemes; the pedicels seldom above a 
line long.
Calyx, when dry, exactly like 
that of the field M., but in the living 
plant its segments are spreading, not 
erect, after flowering.
Corolla very small, 
of a bright blue, with a small, concave 
limb.
On dry, open places, in central and 
southern Europe, to the Caucasus and 
the western Himalaya.
Not so frequent 
in Britain, but apparently more so in the 
south of England than further to the 
north, and is also found in Ireland.
FL early summer^ and dies soon after.
A white-flowered and more 
permanent variety is often cultivated.
Occasional intermediate forms 
excite some doubts as to whether this be really specifically distinct 
from the field M.
5. Changing Myosote.
Myosotis versicolor, Pers.
(Eig. 696.) 
(Jf. scorpioides, Eng. Bot.
t. 480.
f. 1.) 
A little hairy annual, with a more 
simple and erect stem than any of the 
foregoing, from a few inches to near a 
foot high, with a spreading tuft of radi- 
cal leaves, and a few erect ones along 
the stem.
Elowers small and nearly 
sessile ; the calyx-segments quite closed 
over the fruit after flowering ; the co- 
rolla small, at first pale-yellow, and 
turning blue as it fades.
On banks, in meadows and pastures, 
in central and southern Europe and 
western Asia, extending northwards in- 
to Scandinavia.
Abundant in Britain.

LIIL BK00MBAPE FAMILY.
OROBANCHACEJE.
Herbs, of a brown or purplish colour, passing into yellow or 
blue, but never green, always parasitical on the roots of other 
herbs or shrubs ; the stems simple or rarely branched, erect, bear- 
ing scales of the same colour instead of leaves, and a terminal 
spike of flowers, each in the axil of a bract, similar to the scales of 
the stem, and accompanied often by a pair of smaller bracts at the

THE BEOOMRAPE FAMILY.
base of the calyx.
Calyx variously divided, usually into 2 or 4 
lobes or sepals.
Corolla broadly tubular or campanulate, often 
curved, the lobes more or less 2- lipped.
Stamens 4, in 2 pairs.
Anthers 2-celled, the cells parallel, and usually pointed at the 
lower end.
Style single, with a 2-lobed stigma.
Ovary and 
capsule 1-celled, the latter opening in 2 valves, with numerous 
small seeds attached to parietal placentas.
A small Order, spread over the greater part of the globe, but chiefly 
in temperate climates, and more abundant in the old world than in 
America.
The floral characters are nearly those of the Scrophularia 
family, with the exception of the ovary and capsule, which are never 
divided into cells, the placentas not joining in the centre.
The ab- 
sence of green leaves at once distinguishes it from all British species 
of that family.
Calyx deeply divided into 2 or 4, pointed sepals 1.

I. BEOOMRAPE, OROBANCHE.
Calyx divided to the base on the upper side, and often also on the 
lower side, so as to form 2 lateral sepals, either entire or 2-cleft, either 
distinct from each other, or more or less connected at the base on the 
lower side, and sometimes on the upper side also, by the intervention 
of a fifth lobe, and always pointed.
Habit and other characters those 
of the family.
It is the principal genus of the Order, extending over the whole of its 
geographical range.
The species are in general difficult to characterize.
Some appear to thrive only on the roots of one species, or at most two 
or three closely allied ones, whilst others will grow on a great variety 
of plants of the most remote natural affinities.
But as the particular 
stock the plant feeds on, occasions some modification in the habit of 
the parasite, it is in many cases a matter of great doubt whether the 
differences observed are owing to this circumstance or to real specific 
distinction.
It is not therefore improbable that some of the species 
here adopted, although much less numerous than those usually dis- 
tinguished, may on a more careful observation prove to be mere 
varieties of each other.
One bract only under each flower.
Plant with little or 
no blue.

1. Great Broomrape.
Orobanche major, Linn.

(Eng. Bot.
t. 421.) 
This, our largest species, as it is first 
developed is of a pale yellow, but very 
soon, assumes in every part a dingy pur- 
plish-brown colour.
Stem simple, stout, 
from 1 to 1^ or 2 feet high, much thick- 
ened at the base, with lanceolate scales, 
which are much shorter and broader at 
the base of the plant.
Flowers closely 
sessile, with one bract to each, forming 
a dense spike at least half the length of 
the whole plant.
Calyx more or less 
deeply divided into 2 or 4 lanceolate 
lobes.
Corolla f to 1 inch long ; the 
tube nearly as broad as long, curved, 
with a very oblique limb ; the upper lip 
entire or shortly 2-lobed, the lower one 
3-lobed, with the middle lobe usually, 
but not always larger than the lateral 
ones, and all the lobes toothed and wavy, although less so than in many 
species.
The upper part of the style and stamens are usually covered 
with short glandular hairs, which are wanting in the lower parts.
On the roots of shrubby Feaflower plants, scattered over nearly the 
whole of Europe.
Not uncommon in some parts of England, chiefly 
on Broom, more rarely on Furze.

The colour of the plant and size of the 
flowers are those of the greater J5., but 
the stem is seldom above 8 or 9 inches 
high ; the flowers are much fewer, and 
further apart ; the tube of the corolla 
is not quite so broad; the upper lobes 
scarcely spreading, and the lower ones 
nearly equal, and the stamens more 
hairy at the base.
The flowers are 
usually sweet-scented.
Said to grow exclusively on Galiums ; 
common on the continent of Europe, 
extending across the whole of Asia.
In

A rather smaller plant than the clove- 
scented B., which it resembles in the 
shape of the flowers, but these are nearer 
the size of those of the lesser _Z?., and the 
whole plant assumes a very red-brown 
colour.
Calyx usually divided into 2 en- 
tire sepals with narrow points, but these 
are sometimes again divided, although 
very unequally, or united in front at 
the base, as in the lesser JB.

Often small, and always more slender 
than any of the preceding species, with 
smaller flowers.
Generally of a light 
brown or yellowish colour, with more 
or less of bluish-purple in the flowers, 
although not running into the deep 
purple-blue of the two following species.
It is usually from 6 to 9 inches high, 
although some of the larger specimens 
exceed a foot ; the lower flowers of the 
spike are at some distance from each 
other.
Segments of the calyx ending

ing on a great variety of plants.
In Britain, not uncommon in south- 
ern and central England, and southern Ireland.
Fl. all summer.
It 
varies according to station, and the plants it affects.
Many of these 
varieties have been considered as species, amongst which three are 
commonly admitted into the British Floras : — O.
Picridis (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2956), a tall, very pale-coloured variety, growing on the 
Hawkweed Picris ; 0.
amethystea, assuming a bluer tint than any of 
the others, and growing on Eryngium ; 0.
Seder ce ( 0.
barbata, Eng.
Bot. Suppl.
t. 2859), not uncommon on Ivy in the south of England 
and Ireland as on the Continent.
It is said to differ from the common 
form in the yellow, not purple, colour of the stigma, and other trifling 
characters, which however do not appear to be at all constant.
6. Blue Broomrape.
Orobanche cserulea, Vill.
(Fig. 716.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 423.) 
Stem simple or rarely branched, 6 to 
9 inches high, with a light-bluish tint.
Flowers of a deep purplish-blue, with 
two small bracts at the base, one on 
each side, besides the larger bract com- 
mon to all Broomrapes.
Calyx usually 
closed at the back by a fifth tooth or 
lobe, much shorter and broader than 
the others.
Corolla- tube rather long 
and curved ; the 5 lobes, although ar- 
ranged in two lips, are less unequal, 
and less wavy than in the preceding 
species.
Chiefly, if not exclusively, on the 
Milfoil Achillea ; not uncommon on the 
continent of Europe, and in west-cen- 
tral Asia.
In Britain, only in grassy 
pastures near the sea, in Norfolk, and in 
the Channel Islands.
Fl. early summer.
The O.
arenaria, a larger plant, of a 
paler blue, parasitical on Artemisias in light, sandy soils, is said to have 
been found also in Jersey ; but all the specimens so named from that 
island which I have seen, have proved to be the blue B.

of a pale straw-colour, with smaller pale- 
blue flowers.
Stem often branched, sel- 
dom above 6 inches high.
Flowers 
shaped like those of the blue B.

like them, they have two small lateral 
bracts besides the larger one ; but the 
calyx is split at the back, and has only 
4 lobes, as in the brown Broomrapes.

Calyx persisting round the fruit, 
usually with 5 teeth or segments, sometimes fewer.
Corolla mo- 
nopetalous, usually 2-lipped, but sometimes nearly regular, with 
4, 5, or rarely more lobes, always overlapping one another in the 
bud.
Stamens usually 2 or 4, in 2 pairs, very rarely 5, inserted 
in the tube of the corolla.
Ovary and capsule divided into 2 cells, 
with several seeds in each cell.
Style simple, usually ending in a 
2-cleft stigma.
A numerous family, widely diffused over the globe, from the Arctic 
Circle to the tropics, although more abundant in temperate regions 
than in the extremes of heat or cold, and generally speaking, well 
marked by the two-lipped or personate corolla, the stamens in pairs, and 
the seeds more than one in each cell of the capsule ; but there are some 
anomalous genera in which these characters are much modified, and 
two large and natural exotic families, the Bignonia and Acanthus fami-

1. Great Mullein.
Verbaseum Thapsus, Linn.
(Fig. 719.) 
(Eng. Hot.

A stout, erect biennial, simple or 
branched, 2 to 4 feet high, clothed with 
soft woolly hairs.
Leaves oblong, pointed, 
slightly toothed, narrowed at the base 
into two wings running a long way down 
the stem ; the lower ones often stalked, 
and 6 or 8 inches long or more.
Flowers 
in a dense, woolly terminal spike, some- 
times a foot or more long.
Corolla yel- 
low, usually 6 to9 lines diameter, slightly 
concave ; 3 of the filaments are covered 
with yellowish woolly hairs, and have 
short 1- celled anthers ; the 2 longer 
stamens glabrous or nearly so, with 
longer anthers adnate to the filaments.
Capsule thick, rather longer than the 
calyx.
Common on roadsides and waste 
places, all over Europe and temperate 
Asia to the Caucasus, Altai, and Hima- 
laya, and now naturalized in America, 
ing as far north as Aberdeen.
Fl. summer.
A variety with a much 
larger and flatter corolla and longer anthers to the long stamens, not 
uncommon on the Continent, where botanists give it the name of V.

A tall biennial, not quite so stout as 
the great M., sometimes branched, and 
either glabrous or with a few glandular 
hairs in the upper part.
Leaves oblong, 
coarsely toothed or sinuate ; the lower 
ones stalked, the middle ones sessile, 
the upper ones clasping the stem or 
shortly decurrent.
Flowers yellow or 
rarely white, in a long, loose, simple ra- 
ceme ; the pedicels from 3 to 6 lines 
long, either solitary or rarely two to- 
gether in the axil of a green bract.
Hairs 
of the filaments purple.
On banks and edges of fields, in cen- 
tral and southern Europe, Russian and 
central Asia, and naturalized in North 
America, but not extending into Scan- 
dinavia.
Indicated in several counties 
of England and southern Ireland, but 
generally regarded as an introduced plant, except perhaps near the 
southern coast.

3. Twiggy Mullein.
Verbascum virgatum, With.
(Fig. 721.) 
(Eng. Bot.

This may be a mere variety of the 
moth M., but the glandular hairs are 
more abundant, and the pedicels of the 
flowers are very short, usually from 2 to 
6 together under each bract.
Apparently limited on the Continent 
to western and central Europe, and ge- 
nerally less common there than the moth 
M., although it has established itself 
here and there as a weed of cultiva- 
tion in northern as well as tropical Ame- 
rica and other distant lands.
Rather 
more frequent in England than the moth 
M., but very rare and probably intro- 
duced only in Ireland.

simple.
Leaves oblong or the lower 
ones ovate, downy, and slightly crenate.
Flowers of a clear blue or sometimes

often woody at the base, with spreading 
or ascending flowering branches, 3 or 4 
inches long.
Leaves small, obovate or

chains of Europe, extending northwards 
to the Arctic Circle, but scarcely into 
Asia.
In Britain, not very abundant, 
and only in the highlands of Perthshire 
and some adjoining counties of Scotland.

Elowering branches often solitary, al- 
ways simple, ascending, from 2 to 4 or 
even 5 inches high, and slightly hairy.
The raceme, when young, forms a short, 
slightly hairy head, and even in fruit is 
but little elongated , consisting of 4 or 5

Stems shortly creeping, very much 
branched, forming a small, flat, dense, 
leafy tuft ; the flowering branches as- 
cending, 2 to 4 or 5 inches high.
Leaves 
nearly sessile, ovate, seldom half an inch 
long, very slightly crenate, and usually 
glabrous as well as the rest of the plant.
Flowers very small, of a pale-blue or 
white, with darker streaks, sessile or 
shortly stalked, in terminal spikes or 
racemes ; but the bracts, especially the 
lower ones, are rather large and leaf- 
like, so as to give the inflorescence much 
the appearance of that of the annual 
Veronicas.
Capsule broad, and often 
rather deeply notched.
In pastures, fields, and waste places, 
in Europe and Russian and central Asia, 
from the Mediterranean to the Arctic 
Circle, and ascending to high alpine summits.

and smoother consistence, more dis- 
tinctly stalked, broadly orbicular, with 
5 or 7 coarse teeth or short lobes, the 
middle one broad and rounded ; but the 
chief distinction is in the calyx, the di- 
visions of which are broadly heart-shaped, 
not narrowed at the base.
Corolla and 
capsule nearly those of the procumbent 
V., but there are usually but 1 or 2 seeds 
in each cell.
In waste and cultivated places, in Eu-

long.
Leaves shortly stalked, ovate and 
toothed ; the lowest opposite, without 
flowers, but the greater number alter-

polita, 
with ovate sepals, and larger blue flowers ; V.

the pedicels are longer, the flowers 
larger, of a bright blue, and the lobes of 
the capsule are broad and divaricate, so 
that the whole capsule when ripe is 
about 4 lines broad and only 2 long.

annual species, but much more abun- 
dant in southern Europe and central Asia 
than in central or northern Europe.

to be half-parasiticon the rootsof grasses.
It is most frequently from 2 to 6 inches 
high, glabrous or slightly downy.
Leaves 
small, sessile, opposite, ovate, deeply 
toothed, the teeth of the lower ones ob- 
tuse, of the upper ones finely pointed.
Flowers in loose, terminal, leafy spikes ; 
the calyx with 4 or 5 pointed teeth ; the 
corolla white or reddish, streaked with 
purple, and a yellow spot in the throat, 
the tube usually shorter than the spread- 
ing lobes.
Capsule oblong.
Sometimes, 
especially in high alpine regions, the 
whole plant is but 1 inch high, with mi- 
nute, almost yellow flowers ; when luxu- 
riant it will attain 8 inches, with flowers 
near half, an inch long.
The leaves in 
some varieties are all broad, obtuse, al- 
most orbicular, and the upper ones closely imbricated ; in others they 
are all narrow, very pointed, and distant.
In pastures, throughout Europe and Russian and central Asia, from 
the Mediterranean to the Arctic regions and the highest alpine sum- 
mits.
Abundant in Britain.
Fl. summer and autumn.
The numerous 
varieties are referred, by those who have studied them most, to tw r o 
principal races, — the common JS., with a more glandular down, espe- 
cially on the calyx, the teeth of the leaves obtuse, or the upper ones 
shortly pointed, the capsule broadly oblong, and the seeds ovoid ; and 
the wood JE.
(E.
nemorosa), w 7 hich is never glandular, the teeth of the 
upper leaves at least ending in a fine point, the capsule very narrow, 
and the seeds spindle-shaped ; but many forms occur in which these 
characters are differently combined, or pass gradually into each other.

yellow, often with a purple spot on the 
upper, or upon both lips ; the tube lon- 
ger than the calyx ; the upper lip late- 
rally compressed, with a tooth or lobe 
on each side in front ; the lower lip 
shorter, with 3 spreading lobes.
Sta-- 
mens 4, in pairs, with obtuse, hairy 
anther-cells.
Capsule orbicular, flat- 
tened, with a few large, flat, usually 
winged seeds.

Mediterranean to the Arctic regions.
Abundant in Britain, often caus- 
ing mucli injury to the herbage.
Fl. summer, or sometimes later.
It 
varies much in stature, in the breadth of the leaves, in the size of the 
flower, and in the form of the teeth of the upper lip ; and botanists 
have distinguished three supposed species, — the larger R.
(R.
major, 
Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2737), with large flowers ; the lesser _K., with small 
flowers ; and the narrow i?., with linear leaves ; but further obser- 
vation has shown that these forms are neither constant, nor marked 
enough to be separated even as permanent races.

640 THE SCKOPHULARIA FAMILY.
LV.
THE LABIATE FAMILY.
LABIATE.
Herbs, or rarely shrubs, with quadrangular stems or branches, 
and leaves always opposite.
Flowers in the axils of the upper 
leaves or bracts, rarely solitary in each axil, more frequently in 
cymes, often so closely clustered that the two opposite cymes 
appear like one whorl (sometimes more correctly called a verticil- 
las ter or false whorl) of 6, 10, or more flowers, the whole forming 
usually a terminal compound spike, raceme, or panicle (more 
strictly termed a thyrsus).
Besides the pair of floral leaves or 
bracts under the whorls, there are often smaller bracts to each 
flower in the whorl.
Calyx 5-toothed, or rarely 2- or 3-lobed.
Corolla with a distinct tube and a more or less irregular 4- or 5- 
lobed limb, usually forming two lips.
Stamens 2 or 4, in 2 pairs.
Ovary 4-lobed, with one erect ovule in each lobe, and a single 
style rising from the centre, and shortly cleft to the top into 2 
stigmatic lobes.
Fruit enclosed in the persistent calyx, separating 
into 4 small one-seeded and seed- like nuts.
A vast family, spread over every quarter of the globe, and readily 
known from all Monojpetals, except the Borage family, by the 4-lobed 
ovary and the 4 small nuts resembling naked seeds in the bottom of 
the calyx ; and from Boraginece the Labiates are distinguished by their 
opposite leaves, the want of the fifth stamen, and usually by the more 
irregular flowers.
Most of the species have also a peculiar strong 
scent, either highly aromatic in many of our culinary potherbs, or as 
disagreeable iu several species of Stachys.
Distinct however as the 
whole family is, the genera into which it has been divided are much 
less so than could be wished.
Those especially which are allied to 
Stachys are separated from it by slight differences in the shape of the 
calyx and corolla, which are not always easy to appreciate.

Savory (Satureia), and Hyssop (Hyssopus) are cultivated among our 
culinary potherbs ; several species of Coleus, including the Ratcliouly, 
in our hothouses ; the shrubby JPhlomis and Leonotis, and the herba- 
ceous Rerilla, Monardas and Dracocephalums, and occasionally a few 
others, in our flower-gardens.
I. SAGS.
SALVIA.
Herbs, or, in some exotic species, shrubs, with the flowers usually in 
whorls of 6 or more, forming terminal racemes or spikes, the floral 
leaves all or most of them reduced to mere bracts.
Calyx 2-lipped, 
the upper lip entire or with 3 small teeth, the lower one 2-cleft.
Corolla 
with the upper lip erect, concave, or arched ; the lower spreading, 3- 
lobed ; the middle lobe often notched or divided.
Stamens really 2, 
although easily mistaken for 4, for the anthers have a long slender 
connectivum, having the appearance of a filament, fastened by the 
centre to the very short real filaments, and bearing at one end a perfect 
anther- cell under the upper lip of the corolla, and at the other end a 
small cell, almost always empty, and usually much deformed.
A very large genus, widely spread over the temperate and warmer 
regions of the globe, although within the tropics the majority of species 
are mountain plants.
The structure of the stamens readily distin- 
guishes them from all other Labiates.
Leaves mostly radical.
Corolla large, near thrice as long as the 
calyx 1.

LYCOPUS.
Herbs, with the habit and flowers of a Mint, but with only 2 stamens, 
and the nuts surrounded by a thickened, somewhat corky border.
Besides the British species there are but very few, dispersed over 
Europe, Asia, and America.
Perhaps indeed all but one may be mere 
varieties of the common one.

MINT.
MENTHA.
Perennial herbs, usually downy or hairy, with rather small flowers 
in dense whorls or clusters, which are either collected in terminal 
heads or spikes, or axillary and distant.
Calyx of 5 teeth, regular or 
slightly 2-lipped.
Corolla with a short tube and a campanulate 4- 
lobed limb, the upper lobe rather broader and sometimes slightly 
notched.
Stamens 4, equal and erect, the anthers 2-celled.
Nuts 
smooth, not bordered.
A natural genus, not numerous in species, but widely diffused over 
the greater part of the globe without the tropics, and most of the 
species, from the variety of situation to which they will adapt them- 
selves, vary so much as to render their exact definition almost hope- 
less.
Many of them also propagate so readily from suckers, that indi- 
vidual varieties are perpetuated so as to assume the appearance of 
species.
Almost all the species vary in the stamens, in some indivi- 
duals much longer than in the corolla, in others included within the 
tube, and often barren ; and in several species individuals occur with 
all the leaves crisped and cut, and have been published as distinct, 
under the names of M.

Nearly as widely diffused over Eu- 
rope and temperate Asia as the last, but 
rather more of a western plant.
It

An erect or ascending perennial, with 
the narrow leaves sessile or nearly so, 
and the cylindrical terminal spikes of 
the horse 3f., but the stem and leaves 
are green and glabrous, although there 
are often hairs on the calyx and bracts.
Chiefly known in Europe, Asia, and 
North America, as the common Mint of

wild in countries where it has been long 
cultivated.

varieties become nearly glabrous.
Leaves 
stalked, ovate or slightly heart-shaped.
Flowers larger than in the horse M.

pointed teeth.
In wet ditches, and marshes, and on 
the edges of streams, throughout Europe

water M., and the corn M., this plant 
has the foliage and calyx of the former, 
but the stem is less erect and often low 
and spreading, as in the corn M.

the flowers, as in the latter species, are 
all in distinct axillary whorls, without 
any terminal head or spike, or with only 
a very few flowers in the axils of the last 
pair of floral leaves.

from the corn M.
is in the more tubular, 
longer calyx, and larger flowers ; but 
immediate forms are so numerous, con- 
necting it on the one hand with the corn 
M. and on the other with the water M.,

a mere variety of the one or of the other.

perennial, more or less hairy, with a 
creeping rootstock, and annual stems, 
from 6 inches to a foot long, rarely ris- 
ing erect to the height of 1 or 2 feet.
Leaves stalked, ovate, and toothed, 1 to

The flowers are in compact heads, with a bract under each flower at 
least as long as the calyx, the whole forming terminal corymbs or 
panicles.
The calyx is also variable, in our species more regular than 
in Thyme, in some exotic ones quite as decidedly 24ipped as in that 
genus, and the lips sometimes entire.
Besides our common species, the greater number of Marjorams are 
east Mediterranean, including the sweet Marjoram of our gardens.

CALAMINT.
CALAMINTHA.
Branching, erect, or ascending herbs, with ovate, toothed leaves, and 
purplish flowers in axillary cymes, sometimes forming dense whorls, 
sometimes loose and paniculate.
Calyx tubular, with 13 longitudinal 
parallel ribs (two between the midribs of the lower teeth, and one only 
between the midribs of the upper teeth), and 5 pointed teeth ; the 3 
upper teeth more or less connected at the base into an upper lip ; the 
mouth more or less closed with hairs.
Corolla-tube usually longer than 
the calyx ; the upper lip erect and slightly concave ; the lower one 
spreading, with 3 broad lobes.
Stamens 4, in pairs under the upper lip, 
the outer ones the longest but not spreading beyond the corolla.
A considerable genus, spread over the temperate regions of the 
northern hemisphere, both in the new and the old world.
It is dis- 
tinguished from Thyme and Marjoram chiefly by the longer corolla 
and the stamens not diverging, from all the following by the arrange- 
ment of the ribs or nerves of the calyx.

An American Calamint with red flowers is occasionally cultivated in 
our gardens.
The common Balm (Melissa officinalis), which often es- 
tablishes itself for a time as an outcast from gardens, in the southern 
districts of England, much resembles a Calamint ; it is however a 
coarser plant, and is distinguished as a genus chiefly by a slight curve 
upwards in the tube of the corolla.

pean annual, with yellow flowers the size of those of the marsh S., has 
been inserted in some British Eloras, probably from having appeared 
among the weeds in some cornfield.
The S.
coccinea, from Mexico, with 
red flowers, and a few other exotic species, are occasionally cultivated 
in flower-gardens.

An annual, seldom above 8 or 9 inches 
high, with very spreading, almost de- 
cumbent branches, and covered with a 
very short, soft down.

perate Europe, from Spain to Scandi- 
navia, and eastward to south Hussia.
Very local in Britain, and chiefly, if not 
exclusively, in the north of England.

often considered as a distinct species.
It is usually a larger plant, and 
the flowers are also larger, and yellow, with a purple spot on the lower 
lip ; but in this, as in the purple variety, the size of the flower is very 
variable, and in some localities the two pass gradually one into the other.

BALLOTA.
This genus, closely allied to the shorter-flowered Stachyses, differs 
chiefly in the the calyx, which is enlarged at the top, so as to be nearly 
funnel-shaped, and, in several exotic species, has 10 or even more teeth.
The corolla, stamens, and nuts are nearly as in Stachys.
The exotic species belong almost exclusively to the Mediterranean 
region, and western Asia.

dichotomous or trichotomous panicle, or, in some exotic species, form- 
ing a single spike.
Calyx more or less expanded at the top into a dry, 
membranous, coloured, and slightly 5-lobed limb, each lobe traversed 
by a green or dark nerve.
Petals slightly united at the base, the sta- 
mens inserted at their point of union.

Fig. 815.
1. Common Statice.
Statice Limonium, Linn.
(Pig. 815.) 
(Eng. Bot.

Sea Lavender.) 
Stock short and thick, with tufts of 
radical leaves from 2 to 5 or 6 inches 
long, obovate or oblong, quite entire, 
glabrous, and narrowed at the base into 
a long stalk ; the midrib is alone pro- 
minent when fresh, but when dry the 
lateral reticulate veins branching from it 
distinctly appear.
Flower- stem erect, 
leafless, 6 inches to a foot or even more 
high, repeatedly forked, so as to form a 
broad corymbose panicle, with a mem- 
branous bract at each division.
Flowers 
numerous, in short, rather loose spikes 
at the end of the branches, with a green 
bract, coloured at the edge, under each 
flower.
Calyx green at the base, dry, 
scarious, and of a pale purple in its up- 
per part, with 5 short, broad teeth, 
which are often slightly toothed or 
jagged.
Petals of a bluish purple, at 
the time of flowering rather longer than the calyx, but the latter be- 
comes subsequently much enlarged, so as to assume the appearance of 
a corolla concealing the real one.
In maritime sands and salt-marshes, on the coasts of western Eu- 
rope, the Mediterranean, and western Asia, and apparently the same 
species on the South American and Californian sea-shore.
Frequent 
on the coasts of England and Ireland, very local on those of Scotland.

A small variety, with less compact spikes, 
has been described as a species, under the name of S.

more branched and compact.
The leaves are much smaller, usually 
scarcely one inch, and rarely two inches long, with shorter stalks, and,

very slightly downy.
Leaves very nar- 
row, 2 to 3 lines long.
Calyx enlarged 
after flowering to about 1^ lines in 
length ; the lobes stiff, erect, narrow,

2. Perennial Scleranth.
Scleranthus perennis, Linn.
(Eig. 830.) 
(Eng. Bot.

This species so much resembles the 
annual S.
that it is by some considered 
as a mere variety, but the root and tufted 
lower part of the stem will last two or 
three years.
The flowering stems, 
usually about 2 inches high, are more 
rigid, the flowers more densely collected 
in terminal cymes, and the calyx is 
rather smaller, with obtuse divisions, 
bordered by a much more conspicuous 
white edging.

GOOSEFOOT FAMILY.
CHENOPODIACEiE.
Herbs or uudershrubs, often succulent, sometimes leafless, 
more usually with alternate or rarely opposite leaves, and no 
stipules ; the small, herbaceous flowers usually in sessile clus- 
ters, either in axillary or terminal spikes or panicles, and often 
unisexual.
Perianth single, calyx-like, deeply divided into 5, or 
in some flowers fewer segments.
Stamens 5, opposite the perianth- 
segments, rarely fewer.
Ovary free, with a single ovule.
Styles 
2 or 3, either free or united at the base.
Fruit consisting of a 
single seed, enveloped in a very thin or sometimes succulent peri- 
carp, and enclosed in the persistent perianth, which is sometimes 
enlarged or altered in form.
Seed usually orbicular and flattened ; 
the embryo curved or spirally twisted, with or without albumen.
The Order is spread over the greater part of the world, and is ra- 
ther numerous in species, especially in maritime situations, or within 
the influence of a saline soil or atmosphere, where they sometimes, in 
combination with Artemisias, give a general grey aspect to the coun- 
try.
They are not easily confounded with any other British Order, 
but approach very near to the Amaranth family, which is chiefly dis- 
tinguished by the presence of 2 or 3 small bracts under each flower, and 
by the tendency of the perianth to become scarious or coloured.
Stem succulent and jointed, without leaves.

The Spinageof our gardens (Spinacia oleracea), probably from west- 
ern Asia, forms a genus closely allied to Orache, but with a differently- 
shaped fruiting perianth, and 4 styles.
One or two species of Amaranth, 
belonging to the above-mentioned Amaranth family, have occasionally 
appeared amongst garden weeds in the neighbourhood of London, but 
do not appear to have anywhere established themselves in Britain.
The same Amaranth family includes the Love-lies-bleeding and Prince s- 
feather (both species of Amarantus), the globe Amaranth (a species 
of Gomphrena), the CocFs-comb (Celosia), etc., of our gardens.
I. SAIiICORN.
SALICORNIA.
Succulent, jointed herbs, sometimes hard and woody at the base, 
without leaves.
Flowers immersed in the upper articles (or inter- 
nodes), forming terminal, succulent, cylindrical spikes, each article 
having 6 flowers, 3 in a triangle on each side.
Perianth succulent, flat, 
and nearly closed at the top ; the stamens (usually 2 or only 1) pro- 
truding through the minutely 3- or 4-toothed orifice.
Style included 
in the perianth, divided into 2 or 3 stigmas.
Nut enclosed in the 
unchanged, succulent perianth.

In its simplest form this is a glabrous, 
bright green, succulent, erect annual, 
scarcely 6 inches high, with few erect 
branches, each one terminated by a spike 
of \ to 1 inch long.
When luxuriant, 
after the first flowering, branches shoot 
out from every joint or node as well as 
from the spike itself; the lower ones be- 
come hard, and often procumbent, and 
rooting at the nodes, and the whole 
plant will extend to a foot or more ; and 
in favourable situations a few plants will 
outlive the winter, so as to have the 
appearance of undershrubs, but pro- 
bably do not last beyond the second 
year.

CHENOPODIUM.
Herbs, either glabrous or covered with a mealy dust ; the leaves 
flat and alternate ; the flowers small and green, in little sessile clusters, 
collected into spikes in the axils of the upper leaves, or forming large 
terminal panicles.

ORACHES.
ATRIPLEX.
Herbs or undershrubs, often covered with a grey or white, scaly 
meal ; the leaves flat and alternate, or the lower ones rarely opposite.
Flowers small and numerous, clustered in axillary spikes or terminal 
panicles as in Goosefoot, but always of two kinds ; in some, which are 
usually males only, the perianth is regular and 5-cleft as in Goosefoot, 
with 5 stamens ; in the females the perianth consists of two flat seg- 
ments (or rather, bracts replacing the real perianth), either free or 
more or less united at the edges, enclosing the ovary.
After flowering 
this false perianth enlarges, is often toothed at the edge, and covered 
with wart-like excrescences.
Seed usually vertical.
In some species 
there are also a few regular female real perianths, which ripen without 
enlarging, and contain a horizontal seed, as in Goosefoot.

%b& 
Fig. 848.
A most variable plant in stature, in 
the shape of the leaf, and in the fruiting 
perianth.
It is an annual, erect or pro- 
strate, dark or pale green, or more or 
less mealy-white, but never so thickly 
frosted or scaly as the frosted O.
Leaves 
all stalked ; the lower ones usually has- 
tate and sometimes opposite ; the upper 
ones often narrow and entire, or coarsely 
toothed.
Flowers clustered in rather 
slender spikes, forming narrow, leafy 
terminal panicles ; the females mixed 
with the males, or a few in separate 
axillary clusters.
Segments of the fruit- 
ing perianth united to about the middle, 
usually ovate or rhomboidal and pointed, 
often toothed at the edge and warted or 
muricate on the back, but very variable 
in size and shape, often of two kinds, a 
larger and a smaller, on the same plant.
On the seacoasts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, extending to the 
Arctic regions, besides being very common inland as a weed of culti- 
vation.
Abundant in Britain.
FL the whole season except early spring.
The principal forms, which have been distinguished as species, although 
they run very much one into another, are the following : — 
a. Hastate O.

or spreading.
Lower leaves broadly triangular or hastate, often 
coarsely and irregularly toothed.
b. Upright 0.

Leaves 
lanceolate, the lower ones broader and hastate.
c. Common O.
(A.

or decumbent.
Leaves mostly lanceolate or the upper ones linear.
d. Narrow O.
(A.
littoralis, Eng. Bot.
t. 708.) Stems prostrate.
Leaves still narrower than in the last, often toothed.
All these varieties have maritime forms, with thicker succulent leaves, 
in some specimens very green and shining, in others more or less mealy- 
white, especially the hastate variety.

Resembles some of the maritime va- 
rieties of the common 0., but is much 
more covered with a white scaly meal ; 
the leafstalks are much shorter, the floral 
leaves almost sessile, and the female 
perianths are mostly clustered in the 
axils of the leaves, whilst the male 
flowers are in rather dense spikes, form- 
ing short terminal panicles.
Leaves 
usually broadly triangular or rhomboi- 
dal, and coarsely toothed.
Fruiting 
perianths always mealy-white, rather 
thick, rhomboidal or orbicular, often 
warted : the segments often united to

Specimens are occasionally found 
with the leaves rather broader and the perianth-segments very slightly

Polygonum maritimum, Linn.
(Fig. 862.) 
(Eng. Bot.
Suppl.

When flowering the first year of it3 
growth, or when luxuriant, this species 
is distinguished from the Knotweed P.
by its thicker stems, larger and thicker, 
more glaucous leaves, larger scarious 
stipules, brown and much veined at the 
base, larger flowers, and especially by 
the nuts, often 2 lines long, projecting 
beyond the perianth, and very smooth 
and shining.
Older specimens, grown 
in dryer sands, have a woody, perennial 
stock, with short, thick branches, com- 
pletely covered by the stipules, the in- 
ternodes being all very short.
In maritime sands, on most of the sea- 
coasts of the northern hemisphere, and 
here and there also in the south.
Com- 
mon on the British coasts.
FL end of 
summer, and autumn.
It is considered 
by American botanists as a variety of the Knotweed P.
The P.
Roberti 
or P.
Bail (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2805) is rather a young or a luxuriant 
state of this plant than a distinct variety, although those names are 
sometimes given to the maritime variety of the Knotiveed P.

Leaves stalked, heart-shaped or broadly 
sagittate, and pointed.
Mowers in little 
loose clusters ; the lower ones axillary, 
the upper ones forming loose, irregular

Stem, foliage, and inflorescence of the 
climbing P., of which it may be a mere 
variety ; but it is more luxuriant, and 
the 3 angles of the fruiting perianth are 
more or less expanded into a white, 
scarious wing, which is often decurrent 
on the pedicel, the whole perianth being 
often 3 lines long.
The nut is also 
usually more shining.
In hedges, open woods, or rich, cul- 
tivated places, in Europe, Russian Asia,

Stock perennial and tuberous, with 
simple, erect, slender stems, 4 to 6 or 
rarely 8 inches high.
Radical leaves on 
long stalks, narrow-oblong or linear; 
stem-leaves few, nearly sessile or clasp-

9. Pale Polygonum.
Polygonum lapathifolium, Linn.
(Fig. 869.) 
Fig. 869.
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1382.) 
Closely resembles the JPersicaria P., 
and is probably a mere variety, distin- 
guished by the pedicels and perianths 
dotted with small prominent glands.
The colour of the plant is usually pale- 
green, the stipules seldom fringed, and 
the nuts usually concave on both sides, 
but these characters are not constant.
In cornfields and waste places, with 
nearly the same range as the JPersicaria 
P., but usually in richer soils, and does 
not extend so far north.
In Britain, 
recorded from England, Ireland, and 
southern Scotland.

slender plant, often decumbent or even creeping at the base, the stipules 
more fringed at the top, the leaves narrower, and the flowers in slender 
spikes, often 2 or 3 inches long, more or less nodding, the clusters 
of flowers almost all distinct, and the lower ones often distant and

Polygonum minus, Huds.
(Fig. 871.) 
(Eng.Bot. t.

Yery near the Wa'erpepper P., and 
probably a mere variety.
It is usually 
a smaller plant, with rather smaller 
flowers, in closer, although slender 
spikes, and has neither the glandular 
perianths nor the biting flavour of that 
species.
In ditches and waste places, on road- 
sides, etc., over the whole range of the 
Waterjpepjper P.
In Britain, not so 
common as that species, and scarcely 
extends into Scotland.
Fl. summer and 
autumn.
The smaller, most distinct form 
is usually found in dryer situations.
When growing in richer, wet situations, 
it can only be distinguished from the 
Waterpepper P.
by the absence of the 
glands on the perianth.
This form has 
been published as a species, under the 
name of P.
mite (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2867).
It is not improbable that further observation may show that 
this and the last three Polygonums are all varieties of one species.

THE DAPHNE FAMILY.
THYMELEACEiE.
A family limited in Britain to the single genus Daphne.
The 
exotic genera associated with it differ chiefly in the number of 
the stamens and in the number and form of the divisions of the 
perianth, or in the consistence of the fruit.
The species are rather numerous in southern Africa and Australia, 
including among the latter the Pimeleas of our greenhouses, with a 
few from the tropics or the northern hemisphere.

Stamens 8, inserted in the top of the tube.
Ovary free within the 
tube, 1 -celled, with a single pendulous ovule.
Style exceedingly short,

Before these leaves 
are fully out, the flowers appear in 
clusters of 2 or 3 along the preceding 
year's shoot : they are purple and sweet- 
scented.
Perianth- tube 3 or 4 lines long, 
and slightly hairy, the lobes rather 
shorter.

linear, and entire.
Male flowers very 
small, in little clusters resembling cat- 
kins.
Females crowded, although soli- 
tar}^ in each axil ; the perianth about 2 
lines long, contracted at the top, with 
the style shortly protruding, forming 
when in fruit a small yellowish or brown 
berry.
In stony or sandy places, especially in 
beds of rivers and torrents, in central 
and eastern Europe and central and Rus-

perianth.
Seed solitary, with a small, straight embryo in the top of 
the albumen.
A considerable genus, widely spread over Europe and temperate 
Asia, but chiefly abundant in southern Africa.
Some of the European 
species have been ascertained to be partially parasitical on the roots of 
other plants, to which they attach themselves by means of expanded 
suckers, like the yellow Hattle and some others of the Scroplmlaria 
family.

row-linear, or, when very luxuriant, ra- 
ther broader, and above an inch long.
Flowers small, in a terminal raceme, 
leafy, and sometimes branching at the 
base ; each flower on a distinct peduncle, 
with 3 linear bracts close under it.
Perianth cleft almost down to the ovary ; 
the tube of a greenish-yellow colour ; 
the segments white, waved or almost 
toothed on the edges, and rolled in- 
wards after flowering.

within the perianth.
Ovary and fruit inferior, 3- or 6-celled, with 
several seeds in each cell.
Albumen fleshy, with a minute embryo.
A small family, widely spread over the globe, chiefly in the warmer 
districts.
The principal genus, Aristolochia, remarkable for the tubu- 
lar perianth, often curved, terminating in an oblique, entire limb, is 
not British ; but the tall, climbing A.

ing rootstock, and very short, incon- 
spicuous stems.
Leaves usually 2 only, 
almost radical, on long stalks, orbicular- 
cordate or kidney shaped, 1 to 2 or even 
3 inches broad.
Between them is a 
single greenish-brown flower, about half

LXVL SPURGE FAMILY.
EUPHORBIACE.E.
Herbs, shrubs, or trees, much varied in foliage and inflorescence.
Flowers always unisexual, with or without a perianth.
Stamens 
various.
Ovary consisting of 3 (rarely 2 or more than 3) united 
carpels, each with 1 or 2 pendulous ovules.
Styles as many as 
carpels, entire or divided.
In the fruit these carpels separate 
from each other and from the persistent axis, and usually open with 
elasticity in two valves.
Seed with a large embryo in fleshy al- 
bumen.
A vast family, chiefly tropical, so varied in aspect that no general 
idea can be formed of it from the three genera which represent it in 
Britain, nor is the connection between these three genera easily under- 
stood without a comparison with intermediate exotic forms.
The 
structure of the ovary and fruit is peculiar to this family amongst uni- 
sexual plants.

Flowering branches or peduncles axillary, the upper ones 
in a terminal umbel of 2 to 5 or more rays, each ray or axillary pe- 
duncle usually several times forked, with a pair of opposite floral leaves 
at each fork, and a small green, apparent flower, really a head of 
flowers between the branches.
These Jlower- heads consist of a small, 
cup-shaped involucre (looking like a perianth), with 4 or 5 very small 
teeth, alternating with as many horizontal yellowish or brown glands.
Within are 10 to 15 stamens, each with a jointed filament, and a mi- 
nute scale at its base, showing that they are each a distinct male 
flower.
In the centre is a single female flower, consisting of a 3-celled 
ovary, supported on a stalk projecting from the involucre and curved 
downwards.
Style 3-cleft.
Fruit of 3 carpels, each with a single seed.

THE ELM FAMILY.
ULMACEJE.
Trees or shrubs, differing from the Nettle family in their flowers 
mostly hermaphrodite, and the ovary generally 2-celled, although 
the fruit has but one seed.
Besides the Elm genus there are but very few, either tropical or 
from the warmer parts of the northern hemisphere.

Trees, with alternate, deciduous leaves, and small flowers in clusters, 
appearing before the leaves on the preceding year's wood.
Perianth

Ovary flat, with 2 short, diverging styles, and divided into 2 cells, 
each with a single pendulous ovule.
Fruit flat, thin, and leaf-like, 
slightly thickened at the centre, where it contains one pendulous seed.
A small genus, spread over the temperate regions of the northern

A tree of considerable size and pic- 
turesque form ; the large brandies 
spreading from near the base unless when 
drawn up in its youth.
Leaves nearly 
sessile, broadly ovate, bordered with 
double teeth, and very unequal or ob- 
lique at the base, usually rough on the 
upper side and downy underneath.
Flowers reddish, in dense clusters, sur- 
rounded by brownish bracts, which soon 
fall off; the pedicels scarcely as long as 
the perianth.
Fruits green and leaf- 
like, broadly ovate or orbicular, 6 to 9 
lines long, with a small notch at the top ; 
the seed suspended in a small cavity 
near the centre of the fruit.
Chiefly in hilly districts, in northern 
and western Europe.
In Britain, it is 
the common wild Elm of Scotland, Ireland, and northern and western 
England, but seldom planted, and rare in south-eastern England, where 
a variety of the common E.

Very near the tuych E., and many botanists consider the two races 
as forming but one species.
The common E.

generally, if not constantly, distinguished by the fruit, which is deeply 
notched, the top of the seed-bearing cavity almost reaching the notch.
It is usually also a taller and straighter-growing tree, attaining in rich 
soils above a hundred feet ; the young branches are more slender, and 
the leaves usually smaller and less coarse ; but all these characters 
are very variable.

THE CATKIN FAMILY.
AMENTACE^.
Trees or shrubs, with alternate flat leaves, usually with stipules, 
and small, unisexual flowers, in cylindrical, oblong, or globular 
spikes, called catkins, which are usually dense, with closely packed, 
scale-like bracts, rarely loose, or with minute deciduous scales.
Stamens in the male catkins 2 or more (rarely united into 1) 
within each scale, usually accompanied by 2 or more smaller 
scales, either distinct or forming in a few cases an irregular or 
oblique perianth, or rarely entirely deficient.
Female catkins 
either like the males, with 1, 2, or 3 flowers within each scale, or 
reduced to a sessile bud, with 2 or 3 flowers in the centre, sur- 
rounded by the lower empty scales of the catkin ; within each 
scale are also usually 2 or 3 inner scales.
Perianth none, or 
closely combined with the ovary, with a minute, free, entire or 
toothed border.
Ovary 1-celled or several-celled, with 2 or more 
styles, always resulting in a 1-celled fruit, which is either a 1- 
seeded nut, or a several-seeded capsule opening in 2 valves.
The 
catkin-scales, or the inner scales, or both, usually persist, and are 
sometimes enlarged into an involucre, either around or under 
the fruit.
Seeds without albumen, at least in the British genera.

THE CATKIN FAMILY.
An extensive family, widely distributed over the globe, but chiefly 
in the temperate regions of both hemispheres, where it often constitutes 
a large proportion of the forest trees.
Minor differences, chiefly in 
the female flowers, have induced its division into several tribes, often 
considered as independent families, but as a whole it forms a natural 
as well as a distinct group.
Among the few British plants that have 
their inflorescence at all resembling catkins, Hippophae is readily dis- 
tinguished by the berry-like fruits and scurfy foliage, Elms by their 
hermaphrodite flowers, and Conifers by their peculiar foliage inde- 
pendently of the important character of the naked seeds.

trating into the tropics along the chain of the Andes or in the Moluccas.
Many exotic species have evergreen or entire leaves, or are mere shrubs, 
but are all readily recognized by the fruit, in which the involucre never 
so completely encloses the nut as in the Chestnut and Beech.
Among 
the most frequent in our plantations may be mentioned the evergreen

(Eig. 909.) 
A stately tree, the longest-lived among 
the natives of our islands.
Leaves de- 
ciduous, although in some varieties they 
will remain through a great part of the 
winter, usually obovate or oblong, irre- 
gularly sinuate or almost pinnatifid ; 
the lobes usually obtuse, glabrous or 
(rarely in Britain) downy underneath.
Cup very much shorter than the acorn, 
with short, obtuse, closely imbricated, 
often scarcely distinct scales.
Extends over the whole of Europe, 
except the extreme north, penetrating 
along the chain of the Caucasus a con- 
siderable way into central Asia, although 
further north it does not cross the Ural.
Fl. spring as the leaves are coming out.
It varies considerably in foliage and inflorescence, and throughout its 
range two remarkable forms appear so definite and usually so perma- 
nent that many of the most acute botanists regard them as distinct 
species.
The question of their specific identity has been much dis- 
cussed, but the arguments adduced on each side are too long to be 
here entered into, nor are they absolutely conclusive in favour of the 
view here adopted, which is nevertheless the result of a close investi- 
gation, carried on for many years in various parts of Europe.
The 
following are the two British races : —

AMENTACE^.
757 
a. Pedunculate British 0.

Leaves sessile or shortly stalked.
Fruits either clustered or spiked, 
above the middle of a peduncle varying from 1 to 5 or even 6 inches 
long.
The commonest Oak over the greater part of England and the 
lowlands of Scotland.
In the hilly parts of the west and north it is 
less abundant and less constant in its characters, and sometimes wholly 
wanting.
b. Sessile British O.
(Q.
Robur sessiliflora, Eng. Bot.
t. 1845.) 
Leaves on footstalks varying from J to 1 inch long.
Emits solitary or 
clustered, either closely sessile on the branch or borne on a short pe- 
duncle, very rarely attaining an inch.
Frequently scattered in woods 
of the pedunculate variety, and then pretty constant in its characters, 
rarely constituting the mass of oak-woods in the lower parts of Britain, 
but in JN~orth Wales and the hilly parts of northern England it is the 
commonest of the two, and very much more variable.

hairy catkins, with small, entire scales.
Stamens in the males 2, rarely

anthers, and a gland-like scale either between the stamens and the 
axis, or more rarely between the stamens and the catkin-scale, or two 
scales, one on each side, but no perianth.
Female flowers solitary 
within each scale, with a gland-like inner scale between the ovary and 
the axis.
Ovary conical, sessile or stalked, one-celled, with several 
ovules inserted on 2 short parietal placentas.
Style forked, each lobe 
entire or shortly 2-lobed.
Fruit a conical capsule, opening in 2 valves.
Seeds several, minute, with a tuft of long, white, silky hairs.
A vast genus, widely spread over the world, but particularly abun- 
dant in the northern hemisphere, from the tropics to the Arctic zone, 
ascending high upon alpine summits, and in low countries chiefly in- 
habiting wet or sandy situations.
The great variations in the shape 
of the leaves of many species, and the difficulty of matching the male 
and female specimens, or the young and old leaves of those species which 
flower before the leaves are out, have produced a multiplication of sup- 
posed species, and a confusion in their distinction, beyond all prece- 
dent.
The following fifteen are all that appear to be truly distinct 
among the British ones ; at the same time, reliable observations are 
wanting on the degree of variation of particular characters, especially

mediate forms between very dissimilar species are not unfrequent in

3. Black Poplar.
Populus nigra, Linn.
(Fig. 927.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1910.) 
A tall, quick-growing tree, readily 
assuming a somewhat pyramidal form, 
quite glabrous, with very glutinous buds.
Leaves broadly rhomboidal or nearly 
triangular, tapering at the top, the lower 
angles rounded, the edge crenated or 
serrated, green on both sides.
Catkins 
loose, about 2 inches long, the scales 
hairy only at the tips.
Stamens more nu- 
merous than in the Aspen or the white P., 
and the lobes of the stigmas shorter and 
broader.
In moist places, the borders of streams, 
etc., in central and southern Europe, 
and the more temperate portions of Eus-

In northern Europe it has 
been much planted, and is now common 
in Scandinavia as well as in Britain, 
but probably not truly indigenous even 
in southern England.

THE PINE FAMILY.
CONIFERS.
Trees or shrubs, mostly with resinous juice.
Leaves stiff, and 
in the European genera always entire, either subulate or linear, 
or short or scale-like.
Flowers monoecious or dioecious, in cylin- 
drical or short catkins, with closely-packed scales, or the females 
rarely solitary.
Stamens inserted either on the axis of the catkin 
under the scales, or the anther-cells sessile on the inside of the 
scales themselves, which then form a part of the stamens.
Ovules 
and seeds naked, that is, without ovary, style, or pericarp, either 
inserted under the catkin-scales or solitary and quite exposed.
An extensive Order, spread over the whole globe, although within 
the tropics chiefly confined to mountainous districts.
In the northern 
hemisphere they often form vast forests, and include the loftiest trees

Three species only are indigenous to Britain, but a large 
number of exotic ones are generally planted, and some to such an ex- 
tent as now to cover large tracts of country.
The very peculiar struc- 
ture of the flowers and seeds of this and the adjoining small tropical 
family of Cycadece, has induced many botanists to consider them as a 
separate class, distinct both from Dicotyledons and 'Monocotyledons.

The most commonly planted Conifers, not belonging to the above 
genera, are species of Cypress, resembling Junipers in foliage and male 
flowers, but the fruit is larger and woody, with numerous small seeds ; 
or of Tkuia, very near Cypress, but with flattened branches, and very 
small, ovate, dry cones with few seeds ; or of Taxodium, with deciduous 
leaves, and a small cone near that of Cypress; besides the Sequoias of 
California, Cryptomeria from Japan, and several others of recent in- 
troduction likely to become common in our plantations.
I. PINE.
PINUS.
Trees, with linear or subulate leaves.
Male catkins closely imbricated, 
with 2 adnate anther-cells on the inside of each scale (at least apparently 
so, for in fact the scale is the connectivum of the anther, and the 
whole catkin thus consists of nothing but closely imbricated anthers).
Female catkins short, consisting of closely imbricated scales, with 2 
ovules on the inside of each ; the for a men, or open pore at the top of 
the ovule, turned downwards.
Fruit a cone, consisting of more or less 
hardened, imbricated scales, each one covering 2 winged seeds.
A large genus, constituting the great mass of the Conifers of the 
northern hemisphere, scarcely penetrating into the tropics, and un- 
known in the southern hemisphere.

a reddish bark, and a rather dense head, but less so than in many 
other species.
Leaves stiffly subulate, evergreen, seldom above 2 
inches long, in pairs, surrounded by short, scarious scales.

sessile, ovoid, conical, recurved when 
young ; the scales hard and woody, 
much thickened upwards, with a short, 
thick point, often turned backward in 
the lower scales of one side of the cone, 
but generally disappearing as the cone 
ripens.
Seeds with an obliquely lan- 
ceolate, obtuse wing, 2 or 3 times as long 
as the seed itself.
Widely distributed over northern and 
central Europe and Russian Asia, chiefly 
in granitic or sandy soils, and in the 
mountains of southern Europe and the 
Caucasus.

Scotch Highlands, and in former times 
in Ireland ; extensively planted all over 
Britain, and quite naturalized in some 
parts of southern England.

The cultivated species of this genus are 
very numerous, belonging to the four principal sections, considered 
by some as genera, viz.
: — 1.
The true Pines, with subulate evergreen 
leaves, in clusters of 2 to 5, and hard cones with the scales usually 
thickened at the top, including, besides the Scotch P., the Pinaster or 
maritime P., the Weymouth P., the JRoman P., etc.
2. The Spruce 
Firs, with shorter, somewhat flattened leaves, arranged singly and 
often in two opposite ranks, and with thin scales to the cones, includ- 
ing the common or Norway Spruce, now almost naturalized in Britain, 
the silver Spruce, the Hemlock Spruce, the halm of Gilead Fir, the 
Douglas Fine, etc.
3. TheLarch, with short, fine, deciduous leaves, in

JUNIPER.
JUMPERUS.
Shrubs or small trees, with evergeen leaves, either small and scale- 
like, or spreading, stiff, and pointed, or both kinds on the same shrub.
Flowers usually dioecious, in minute axillary catkins ; the males con- 
sisting of broad, shield-shaped scales, with 3 to 6 anther-cells attached 
to their lower edge ; the females with imbricated, empty scales at the 
base, and 3 to 6 fleshy ones at the top, coalescing into one, and en- 
closing as many ovules, with their foramen or open pore turned up- 
wards.
Fruit a small berry, formed by the succulent scales, enclosing 
1 or 2 hard seeds.

Class II.
MONOCOTYLEDONS.
Stem not distinguishable into pith, wood, and bark, but consist- 
ing of bundles of fibres, irregularly imbedded in cellular tissue, 
with a firmly adherent rind outside.
Seeds w T ith one cotyledon, 
the embryo undivided, the young stem being developed from a 
sheath-like cavity on one side.
Besides the above positive characters, Monocotyledons may be gene- 
rally known by their simple, entire, alternate or radical leaves, with 
simple parallel veins, the base usually encircling or sheathing the stem 
or the base of the next leaf; and the parts of the flowers are most fre- 
quently in threes, the calyx and corolla, when present, being generally 
similar in appearance, forming a single perianth of six parts.
In 
several families, however, the perianth is entirely wanting, or reduced 
to a very few small scales ; in the Arum family, in Tamus, and Paris, 
the leaves are somewhat netted- veined ; and in some Naiads, and in 
Paris, and some Convallarias, they are opposite or whorled.

Flowers enclosed in a sheath 
near the base of leaves similar to the others, but usually smaller.
Within this sheath is an oblong or linear, thin, leaf-like peduncle, on 
one side of which are arranged in two rows a few sessile anthers, with 
3 or 4 sessile or nearly sessile ovaries, tapering into a deeply 2-cleft, 
linear style.
Embryo split longitudinally into 2 valves, which fold 
over a long, curved, linear radicle.

Stratiotes aloides, Linn.
(Fig. 967.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 379.

ducing at the bottom of the water tufts 
of sessile, long and narrow, more or less 
succulent leaves, bordered by small, 
pointed teeth.

either solitary or in spikes, racemes, or panicles, each one in the 
axil of a bract.
Perianth superior, irregular, with 6 usually petal- 
like segments ; the 3 outer ones, called sepals, and 2 of the inner 
ones, called petals, often nearly alike ; the third inner one, called 
the lip or labellum, differing from the others in shape or direction.
Opposite to the lip, in the axis of the flower, is the column, con- 
sisting of 1 or rarely 2 stamens, combined with the pistil ; the 
2-celled anther or anthers being variously situated on the style 
itself.
Pollen rarely granular, more frequently cohering into 1 or 
2 pairs of oblong or globular pollen-masses, tapering at one end 
into a point.
Ovary inferior, 1-celled, with 3 parietal placentas.
Capsule 3-valved, with innumerable minute seeds, resembling 
fine sawdust.
A very extensive Order, spread over all parts of the globe.
Our own 
species, and generally those of temperate regions, are terrestrial, but a 
large proportion of the tropical ones are epiphytes, growing upon the 
stems and branches of trees, but without penetrating into their tissue.
JSTumbers of these are now becoming well known, having been of late 
years extensively cultivated in our hothouses for the singularity of 
the forms assumed by the flowers, as well as for the great beauty of 
some of them.
The genera are distinguished chiefly by the form and 
relative arrangement of the anther-cells, the pollen-masses, and the 
stigma, and the shape and direction of the lip, characters which, how- 
ever essential, are in many cases as difficult to describe clearly as to 
observe accurately, especially in dried specimens.
For the beginner, 
therefore, I have endeavoured in the following table to select such 
prominent features as may guide him to the British species, indepen- 
dently of the more accurate technical characters, which may be reserved 
for subsequent study.

Leaves varying from 
nearly ovate to narrow-lanceolate, and 
often marked with dark spots.
Flowers 
in a dense oblong spike, 2 or 3 inches 
long, usually of a rather pale pink, but 
varying much in depth of colour.
Bracts

mere variety.
It is usually more luxuriant, the stem more hollow, the 
leaves larger and not always spotted, the spike longer and more leafy, 
the lower bracts, and sometimes nearly all, as long as or longer than 
the flowers, the flowers are usually deeper-coloured and less varie- 
gated, the lip toothed only or very obscurely 3-lobed, and the spur 
thicker ; but these characters are none of them quite constant.

Tubers entire.
Stem 1 to 1\ feet 
high, with 2 rather large leaves at its 
base, varying from broadly ovate to ob- 
long ; the outer leaves very few, and 
usually reduced to sheathing scales.
Flowers pure white or with a slight 
greenish tinge, rather large, and sweet- 
scented, in a loose spike from 3 to 6 or 
8 inches long, with lanceolate bracts 
about the length of the ovary.
Two 
lateral sepals spreading, the upper one 
arching over the column with the petals.
Lip linear and entire, rather longer than 
the sepals, and usually greenish at the 
tip.
Spur slender, twice as long as the 
ovary.
In moist pastures, and meadows, on 
grassy slopes and open places in moist 
woods, throughout Europe and Russian 
Asia, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Circle.
G-enerally dis- 
tributed over Britain.
Fl. all summer.
It varies much in the breadth 
of the leaves as well as of the parts of the flower, and the extreme forms 
have been distinguished as species, the name of S.
chloraniha being 
given to those in which the flowers are large, usually very white (al- 
though the name means ' green-flowered '), and the anther-cells much 
more broadly diverging at the base.
But every intermediate may be 
observed between the broad and the narrow forms.

In stature, and its small flowers with very short spurs, this species 
approaches the dwarf Orchis, but the flowers are white, and the an- 
thers are more like those of Habenaria than of Orchis.

extending into Asia beyond the Caucasus, and probably containing 
but few real species, although some botanists, availing themselves of 
the most trifling characters, observed chiefly in cultivated varieties,

THE LILY FAMILY.
LILIACE2R.
Perennial herbs, with a creeping, bulbous, or clustered root- 
stock, and either radical leaves and peduncles, or annual, biennial, 
or, in a few exotic species, perennial, leafy flowering-stems.
Flowers hermaphrodite or rarely unisexual.
Perianth inferior, 
petal-like, with 6 divisions.
Stamens 6.
Ovary free, 3-celled, 
with several ovules or rarely only one ovule in each cell.

berry.
In a very few cases the parts of the flower are reduced to 
4, or increased to 8.
A large Order, widely distributed over every part of the globe, and 
supplying several of the most gorgeous ornaments of our flower-gardens.
It is easily distinguished from the Alisma family by the carpels united 
into a single ovary and fruit, from the Amaryllis family by the free 
or superior ovary, from the Hush family by the petal-like, coloured 
perianth.
It is usually divided into two or more Orders, variously cir- 
cumscribed according as the character is taken from the foliage, the 
fruit, the seed, or the stock, none of which taken alone give a very 
natural demarcation, A more natural arrangement appears to be to

terminal raceme of yellow flowers flattened into a corymb, with a leaf- 
like green bract under each pedicel, and sometimes a leaf below the 
flowers.
Perianth spreading, with distinct segments.
Stamens in- 
serted at their very base, with filiform, not flattened filaments.
Seeds 
of Omit hog alum.
A small European and Asiatic genus, closely allied to Ornitliogalum, 
with which it was formerly united, but distinguished by the stamens, 
the yellow flowers, and more leafy bracts.

Bulbs small, forming usually two new 
ones every year, one on each side of the 
old one.
Leaves 1 or very rarely 2, 
linear, pointed and curved like those of 
a Tulip.
Stem slender, rarely 6 inches 
high.
Flowers 3 or 4, in a flat raceme, 
almost contracted into an umbel ; the 
leaf-like bracts as long as the pedicels 
or longer.
Perianth-segments about 6 
lines long, very spreading, narrow ob- 
long, yellow, with a green back.
In meadows and fields, especially in 
sandy soils, over the greater part of Eu- 
rope and Russian Asia, except the ex- 
treme north.
Occurs in several parts of 
England, and the" lowlands of Scotland, 
but rarely, and is not found in Ireland.
Fl. spring.
Continental botanists dis- 
tinguish as species several forms, accord- 
ing as to whether there are 1, 2, or 3 bulbs at the time of flowering 
(if one only, it is the old bulb still remaining entire, the new ones com- 
mencing only, or not yet visible ; if 3, the 2 new ones are fully formed, 
spreading out horizontally before the old one is absorbed ; if 2, the 
old one is fully absorbed, leaving only a shrivelled stem between the 
2 new ones), and some slight differences in the breadth, and obtuse or 
pointed ends of the perianth-segments, and it is probable that similar 
variations may be found in the British specimens.

stamens are not longer than the perianth.
It is also usually not so stout a plant, 
the bulb smaller, with the young offsets 
on slender stalks, and the umbel is oc-

perianth is usually much paler and 
greener, and the inner filaments are said 
to be rather more deeply cleft.
The 
umbel always bears bulbs intermixed

These species are well distributed into two sections.
In the one, 
comprising the first ten of the following species, the seeds are ovate or 
oblong, scarcely pointed.
In the second section, to which belong the

The shortly creeping matted rootstock 
bears dense tufts of cylindrical leafless 
stems, 2 to 3 feet high or even more, 
erect, but soft and pliable, sheathed at 
the base by a few brown scales.
Some 
of these stems remain barren so as to 
resemble leaves ; others bear, on one 
side, at 4 to 6 or 8 inches below the top, 
a densely clustered panicle of small 
green or brown flowers ; the very nu- 
merous peduncles vary from a line or 
two to above an inch in length, the cen- 
tral smaller ones have but 2 or 3 flowers, 
the others a considerable number in 
irregular cymes.
Perianth - segments 
about a line long, very pointed.
Cap- 
sule about as long, very obtuse or even 
notched.

Two extreme forms are usually distinguished as species, the 
dense-floivered R.

in close clusters of about an inch diameter, usually brown ; and the 
loose-flowered R.
(J.

3 inches diameter, and paler- coloured ; but every gradation may be 
observed between them in this respect, as well as in other more mi- 
nute characters which have been assigned to them respectively.

An exceedingly variable species in habit and size, but readily known 
by its leaves, which sheath the stem below, and are cylindrical upwards, 
and hollow, but divided inside by cross partitions of pith, which give 
them, especially when dry, the appearance of being jointed.
Flowers 
in little clusters of from 3 or 4 to 8 or 10 or more, arranged in more or 
less compound terminal panicles ; the outer bracts, and sometimes one 
or two of the others, ending in a short, fine leaf.

On 
the edges of ponds and watery ditches 
the stems w r ill spread over the water, 
rooting in it at the joints, often covering 
it to a great extent with dense floating

THE SEDGE FAMILY.
CYPERACE^.
Herbs, resembling in aspect the Hushes, or more frequently 
the Grasses, but usually stiffer than the latter, with solid stems, 
and the sheaths of the leaves closed all round.
Flowers in little 
green or brown spikes, called spilcelets, which are either solitary 
and terminal, or several in a terminal (or apparently lateral) 
simple or compound cluster, spike, umbel, or panicle.
Each spike- 
let is placed in the axil of a scale-like or leafy outer bract, and 
consists of several scale-like, imbricated bracts, called glumes, 
each containing in its axil one sessile flower.
Perianth either 
none or replaced by a few bristles or minute scales.
Stamens 
3 or rarely 2.
Ovary (in the same or in a distinct glume) simple, 
1-celled, the style more or less deeply divided into 2 or 3 branches 
or linear stigmas.
Eruit a small, seed-like nut, flattened when 
the style is 2-cleft, triangular when it is 3 -cleft, containing a 
single seed.
A large family, abundantly distributed all over the globe, but more 
especially in moist situations or on the edges of waters.
It is inter- 
mediate as it were between the Hushes and the Grasses, distinguished 
from the former by the absence of any regular perianth, from Grasses 
cypeeacej:.
885 
generally by the want of an inner scale or palea between the flower 
and the axis of the spikelets ; by the simple, not feathery, branches of 
the style ; besides that in most cases the two families are readily 
known by the sheath of the leaves closed round the stem in the Sedges, 
slit open on the side opposite to the blade in the Grasses.
The glumes 
are also most frequently brown in the former, green or purplish in the 
latter.
Flowers unisexual, the stamens and ovaries under separate 
glumes, either in the same or in separate spikelets.
Ovary enclosed in a little bottle-shaped utricle?

SCIRPUS.
Spikelets either solitary and terminal or several together, forming 
one or more heads or clusters, or an irregular panicle, either terminal 
or apparently below the top of the stem.
Glumes several in each 
spikelet, imbricated all round the axis, all containing a perfect flower 
in their axil except sometimes the lowest one.
Hypogynous bristles 
either 6 or fewer and shorter than the glume, or altogether wanting.
A large genus, widely distributed over the whole world, and, like 
other large genera of Sedges, containing species very unlike each other 
in general habit.
It has been repeatedly endeavoured to divide it into 
several, with characters derived from the hypogynous bristles, the shape 
of the base of the style, the number of its parts, etc., but the smaller 
groups so formed still include species as unlike each other as those of 
the original genus, whilst species closely resembling each other in 
every other respect have become widely separated.
The genus is there- 
fore here retained in its integrity, distinguished from Beaksedge by the 
glumes all bearing flowers except the lowest, from Cyperus by the 
arrangement of the glumes, and from Blysmus by the arrangement of 
the spikelets.

Isolepis, Brit.
Fl.) 
Very like the bristle S., but usually 
still more slender, although sometimes 
attaining 6 or 8 inches ; the point of the 
outer bract scarcely exceeds the spikelet, 
and the nut has not the longitudinal ribs 
and furrows of the bristle S.
In marshes, and edges of pools, chiefly 
near the sea, frequent in the southern 
hemisphere, and in the Mediterranean 
region of the northern hemisphere, ex- 
tending along the western coasts to the 
British Channel.
In Britain, on the 
southern and western coasts of England, 
the west of Scotland, and Ireland.

Scirpus Holoschoenus, Linn.
(Fig. 1083.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 1612.
Isolepis, Brit.
Fl.) 
A stiff, rush-like plant, with a stout, 
creeping rootstock, and cylindrical stems, 
1 to 2 feet high or even more, with 1 or 
2 stiff leaves sheathing the base.
Spike- 
lets very numerous and small, closely 
packed into one or more globular heads, 
forming a lateral cluster or umbel, the 
largest stiff outer bract forming an ap- 
parent continuation of the stem.
The 
largest heads are seldom above 4 or 5 
lines diameter, and contain upwards of 
30 spikelets, of a light brown colour, 
each containing many flowers.
No hy- 
pogynous bristles.
Style 2-cleft or rarely 
3-cleft.
In moist places, chiefly near the sea, 
in the Mediterranean region, extending 
eastward into central Asia, and north- 
ward in western Europe to the Loire, 
and here and there into central Europe.
In Britain, only in two neighbouring localities in North Devon and 
Somerset.

Sharp Scirpus.
Scirpus pungens, Vahl.
(Fig. 1084.) 
(Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2819.) 
Yery near the triangular S., but a 
rather smaller plant ; one or two of the 
sheaths bear narrow, keeled leaves, 1 to 
3 inches long, and the spikelets are few 
(usually 3 to 6), all sessile, in a close 
cluster ; the stiff, triangular, outer bract 
continuing the stem as in the triangu- 
lar S.
In bogs, marshes, and on the margins 
of pools, chiefly in North America and 
the West Indies, but occurs occasionally 
in western Europe, and has been found 
on the banks of St. Ouen's Pond, in 
Jersey.
Fl. summery rather late.

Eootstock creeping.
Stems acute- 
ly triangular, 2 or 3 feet high, leaf- 
less, except that the one or two loose 
sheaths at the base bear a short lanceo- 
late blade, from a couple of lines to near 
an inch long.
Spikelets usually 8 or 10 
or even more, the central ones sessile, 
the others stalked, forming a compound 
lateral cluster or umbel ; the stiff, tri- 
angular outer bract continuing the stem 
for an inch or more.
Each spikelet is 
ovoid, 4 or 5 lines long ; the glumes 
brown, broad, usually notched or fringed 
at the top, with a minute point.
Hypo- 
gynous bristles about 5.

Lake Scirpus.
Scirpus lacustris, Linn.
(Fig. 1086.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 666.) 
Rootstock creeping, with stout, erect 
stems, from 2 or 3, to 6 or 8 feet high, 
cylindrical at the base, gradually taper- 
ing upwards, and sometimes obtusely 
triangular near the top, with a single 
short leaf near the base.
Spikelets 
ovoid or oblong, 3 to 6 lines long, rather 
numerous, in a compound lateral umbel 
or cluster, the outer bract continuing 
the stem.
Glumes numerous, broad, 
brown, fringed at the edge, notched at 
the top, with a little point in the notch.
Hypogynous bristles 5 or 6.
Style 2- 
or 3- cleft.
JN"ut smooth.
On the margins of lakes and ponds, 
and in watery ditches, extending all 
over Europe and Russian Asia, from the 
Mediterranean to the Arctic regions, 
and in North America.
Abundant in 
Britain.
Fl. summer.
Two varieties 
are often distinguished as species, the 
S. lacustris, with 3-cleft style and smooth glumes, and the S.
tabernce- 
montani, or S.
glaucus (Eng. Bot.
t. 2321), with a 2-cleft style and 
raised dots on the glumes ; but these characters are very inconstant, 
and there are often 2-cleft and 3-cleft styles in the same spikelet.
The 
name of S.
Duvalii, or S.
carinatus (Eng. Bot.
t. 1913), is sometimes 
given to a variety of the lake S.
with the stems rather more triangular 
at the top, sometimes to a slight variety of the triangular S.

COTTONSEDGS.
ERIOPHORUM.
Habit and characters of Scir_pus, except that the hypogynous bristles 
as the flowering advances, protrude to a great length beyond the glumes, 
forming silky-cottony tufts, which have given to tbese plants the name 
of Cotton-rushes or Cotton-grass.
The style is usually 3-cleft.
A genus of few species, all bog plants, restricted to the northern 
hemisphere, and most abundant in high latitudes or at considerable 
elevations.
Spikelets solitary.
Spikelets 2 or 3 lines long, oblong, and brown.

1. Alpine Cottonsedge.
Eriophorum alpinum, Linn.
(Fig. 1089.) 
(Eng. Bot.
t. 311.) 
In everything but the long bristles 
this plant precisely resembles the tufted 
Scirpus.
It has the same densely tufted 
stems, 6 to 10 inches high, with imbri- 
cate sheaths at the base ; the inner ones 
with very short leafy tips, and small, 
brown, solitary and terminal spikelets.
After flowering the hypogynous bristles, 
about 6 to each flower, form a silky tuft 
attaining an inch in length.
In bogs, in the high mountain ranges 
of Europe and Russian Asia, or at high 
latitudes all round the Arctic Circle.
In Britain it is perhaps now extinct, 
the bog, near Forfar where it was for- 
merly found being now drained, and if 
it be not found in other parts of the 
Scotch Highlands it must be expunged

CYPERACE^.
903 
ragged sheaths, one or two of which bear 
linear, almost subulate leaves, shorter 
than the stem, and one or two of the 
upper sheaths inflated, without any or 
only a very short blade.
Spikelet so- 
litary, terminal, ovoid, 6 to 8 lines long, 
of a deep olive-green.
Hypogynous 
bristles very numerous to each flower, 
forming at length very dense cottony 
tufts, nearly globular, about an inch in 
diameter.
In bogs and wet moors, in northern 
and central Europe, Russian Asia, and 
North America, and in the mountains of 
southern Europe.
Extends all over 
Britain, but especially abundant in the 
mountains of Scotland and Ireland.

Rootstock creeping.
Leaves few, 
mostly radical, much shorter than the 
stem, more or less triangular, or chan- 
nelled at the top or all the way along, 
those on the stem often very short.
Stems about a foot high, with a termi- 
nal umbel of 2 or 3 to 8 or 10 or even 
more spikelets ; the inner ones sessile, 
the outer ones more or less stalked and 
often drooping ; the 1 to 3 outer bracts 
more or less leafy.
Each spikelet ovoid 
or oblong, 5 or 6 lines long ; the glumes 
thin, of an olive-green, with scarious 
edges, or sometimes altogether brown.
Hypogynous bristles very numerous, 
forming dense cottony tufts, often at- 
taining 1 to 1\ inches in length.
In bogs and wet moors, the commonest 
species in Europe, Russian Asia, and 
North America.
Erequent in Britain.

THE SEDGE FAMILY.
3 species, the broad-leaved C.
(E.
latifolium), with leaves flattened the 
greater part of their length ; the slender C.
(E.
gracilc), with very 
slender leaves, and few, almost erect spikelets ; and the narrow-leaved 
C. (E.
a ngusli folium), with intermediate leaves and more numerous 
spikelets.
Other characters, derived from the smoothness or rough- 
ness of the peduncles, or from the length of the cottony bristles, do not 
appear to be near so constant as has been supposed.
VIII.
KOBEESIA.
KOBRESIA.
Perennial herbs, with grass-like leaves, radical or sheathing the 
stems at the base.
Spikelets sessile in a' terminal spike, simple or 
rarely branched at the base, with a glume-like bract under each spike- 
let.
In each spikelet the lowest glume encloses an ovary with a long 
trifid style, the next one or rarely two glumes enclose 3 stamens, and 
there is often a small rudimentary glume or awn terminating the axis.
Some spikelets have only one glume enclosing an ovary, and some, near 
the end of the spike, have only one glume with 3 stamens.
Besides the British species the genus comprises one or two from the 
continent of Europe.
1. 
Sedge-like Kobresia.
Kobresia carieina, Willd.
(Fig. 1092.) 
(Sclicenus monoicus, Eng. Bot.
t. 1410.) 
A low, Carex-like plant, forming dense 
tufts seldom above 6 inches high ; the 
leaves radical or sheathing the stems at 
the base, spreading, and much shorter 
than the stem.
Spikelets 4 or 5, short 
and brown, closely sessile in a short 
terminal spike.
In each spikelet the 
lower flowers are female, consisting with- 
in the glume of an ovary with a 3- cleft 
style.
The upper spikelets of the spike 
and usually one terminal flower of the 
lateral spikelets are males, consisting of 
3 stamens within the glumes.
Some- 
times the lower spikelets are slightly 
compound or branched.
In moors and wet places, in the moun- 
tains of northern and central Europe, 
and in the Caucasus.

CAREX.
CABEX.
Herbs, mostly perennial, with Grass-like leaves, chiefly radical or 
on the lower part of the stem.
Spikelets solitary or several in a ter- 
minal spike, or the lower ones distant or stalked, or rarely forming a 
short compound spike or dense panicle.
Flowers unisexual, the stamens 
and pistils always in separate glumes, either in separate spikelets or 
in different parts of the same spikelet, which is then called mixed or 
androgynous.
Glumes imbricated all round the axis.
Stamens in the 
males 3, or rarely 2, without bristles or inner scales.
Ovary in the 
females enclosed within a bottle-shaped or inflated sack or utricle, con- 
tracted at the top, with a small opening through which protrudes the 
2-cleffc or 3-cleft style.
This sack persists round the nut, forming an 
angular or bladdery outer covering to the seed-like fruit.
It is by 
some botanists considered as a perianth, but various circumstances are 
against that supposition, and its real analogies are not as yet satisfac- 
torily made out.
A very large and well-defined genus, widely spread over Europe, 
northern Asia, and North America, extending into the mountain- 
ranges of the tropics, and the extratropical regions of the southern 
hemisphere.
The great conformity of the essential characters of the 
genus renders it difficult to break it up into well-marked sections, and 
the main divisions are usually taken from the relative position of the 
male and female spikelets or of their male and female portions.
These 
characters are readily appreciated when the plant is in flower, but 
when in fruit, a state in which it is necessary to procure it in order 
to determine the species with accuracy, it requires some attention 
not to overlook the few male flowers at the base or at the top of the 
mixed spikes, as, the stamens having fallen away, they then appear like 
empty glumes.

A rather tall species, with leafy stems often 2 feet high, allied on the 
one hand to the remote C, but the spikelets are not so distant, and the 
lowest is either branched, or there are 2 or 3 together, either sessile or 
very shortly stalked, and only one or two of the lower bracts are leaf- 
like.
On the other hand, the clustered lower spikelets show an ap- 
proach to the panicle C, and, as in that species, there are a few male 
flowers at the top of the terminal spikelets ; but the inflorescence is 
much more slender, the spikelets much more distant, and there are 
usually a few male flowers at the base of most of them.

A stout species, forming large tufts ; 
the stems attaining from 1 to 3 or even 
4 feet in height, and more or less trian- 
gular, but never so much so as in the 
fox C.
; the leaves in luxuriant specimens

or panicle, sometimes 4 or 5 inches long, 
with the lower branches spreading and 
an inch long, sometimes contracted into 
a spike like that of the fox C, but more

Fl.) 
A very variable species, but (with the 
following, acute C.) readily known among 
all the British species with distinct male 
and female spikelets, by the 2-cleft 
styles and almost flat fruits.
The root- 
stock has creeping runners, but the 
stems are often densely tufted, enclosed 
at the base by the brown sheaths of the 
leaves, the outer ones often without 
blades and worn into ragged fibres.
In 
dry soils the stems are scarcely 6 inches 
high, and the leaves still shorter; in 
rich swamps the stems attain 4 feet, 
with the leaves almost as long.
Spike- 
lets 3 to 6, each from \ to 1\ inches long; 
the terminal one and the upper portion 
or the whole of the next male, the 
remainder female ; the lowest usually 
shortly stalked, and 1 or 2 of the outer 
bracts leafy.
Glumes dark-brown or 
black, often with a green midrib.
In pastures, meadows, and marshes.
Common in Europe and Rus- 
sian Asia, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic regions, and in North 
America.

The principal forms occurring in 
Britain, often considered as species, are : — 
a. Rigid tufted C.
(C.
rigida, Eng. Bot.

form, scarcely 6 inches high, with short, flat, and rigid leaves.
In ex- 
posed situations, at great elevations, or at high northern latitudes.
b. Common tufted C.
Usually 1 to 3 feet high, loosely tufted, with 
narrow leaves, including many intermediate forms passing gradually 
into the preceding and following varieties.
c. Densely -tufted C.
(C.
stricta, Eng. Bot.
t. 914.) Usually about 
2 feet high, more glaucous and tufted than the last variety, with nar- 
row leaves, rather long spikelets, the fruits more distinctly arranged in 
8 or 9 rows, and their nerves more strongly marked.
Equally common 
with the last variety, but usually in more open situations.
d. Water tufted C.

Spikelets about 3, 
ovoid, black or dark-brown ; the termi- 
nal one mixed, hairy, a few male flowers 
at its base ; the 2 others female, one

THE SEDGE FAMILY.
a. Tawny distant C.
(C.
fulva, Eng. Bot.
t. 1295, and C.
speirosta- 
chya, Suppl.
t. 2770), with short, pale-coloured spikelets, and a rather 
long beak to the fruit.
b. Starred distant C.
(C.
depauperata, Eng. Bot.
t. 1098), with only 
4 or 5 fruits to the spikelet, but each one larger, somewhat inflated, 
with a very long beak.
c. Two-nerved distant C.
(C.
binervis, Eng. Bot.
t. 1235), with darker 
spikelets and more angular fruits.
d. Smooth distant C.
(C.
laevigata, Eng. Bot.
t. 1387), like the last, 
but the slender green spikelets often 1 to 1^ inches long, much like 
those of the wood C, but erect, not drooping.

Dotted Carex.
Carex punctata, Good.
(Fig. 1128.) 
Very much like the common seacoast 
form of the distant C, of which it may 
be a mere variety ; but the fruits appear 
to be entirely without longitudinal ribs, 
except the 3 angles, which are slightly 
prominent.
Indicated here and there in various 
parts of the area of the distant C, and 
has been found in two or three localities 
on the west coast of England, and in 
Ireland.

Carnation-grass.) 
Stems tufted, but emitting creeping runners from the base, 1 to 1\ 
feet high, with rather short, erect, flat leaves, more or less glaucous.
Spikelets usually 3, the terminal one male, the others female, distant, 
erect, stalked, cylindrical, \ to 1 inch long, often loosely imbricated ; 
the flowers, especially in the lowest one, at some distance from each 
other.
Bracts shortly leafy, with rather long sheaths.
Glumes brown.
Styles 3-cleft.
Fruits ovoid, without ribs except the 3 angles, obtuse, 
with a very short beak or point, like those of the glaucous C, from 
which plant this species differs chiefly in the more erect, loose female 
spikelets, and in the male spikelet always solitary.

An alpine 
variety, not uncommon in high northern 
latitudes, and at considerable elevations 
in the mountains of central Europe, with 
the sheaths of the bracts looser, the 
spikelets darker-coloured and few- 
flowered, and the fruits more decidedly 
tapering into a beak, has been distin- 
guished as a species, under the name of 
C vaginata (C.
Mieliehoferi, Eng. Bot.

It is also said to have the minute point on the anthers 
more distinct : but all these characters appears to be too variable to be 
relied upon as specific.
It grows with the smaller form, and is rather 
more frequent in Britain.

LXXXVIL THE GRASS FAMILY.
GRAMINEjE.
Herbs, with stems usually hollow, except at the nodes, and 
alternate, narrow, parallel-veined, entire leaves, sheathing the 
stem at their base, but the sheaths are usually split open on the 
side opposite to the blade, and terminate, within the base of the 
blade, in a small scarious appendage called a ligule.
Flowers in 
spikelets, arranged in terminal spikes, racemes, or panicles.
Each 
spikelet consists usually of 3 or more chaff-like, concave scales or 
bracts, called glumes, arranged alternately on opposite sides of the 
spikelet, their concave faces towards the axis ; the 2 lowest or first 
and second glumes usually empty, nearly opposite to each other, 
GKAMINE^E.
. 937 
and often differently-shaped from the others.
The succeeding, or 
flowering glumes, enclose each a rather smaller scale called a palea, 
usually thinner, and with 2 longitudinal ribs or veins, placed either 
between the glume and the axis of the spikelet, with its back to 
the axis, or apparently opposite the glume at the end of the axis.
Where there are more than three glumes, the third or lowest 
flowering glume is usually close to the second, its flower is some- 
times imperfect, or it is even quite empty, and it is often interme- 
diate in shape betwen the outer empty ones and the succeeding 
flowering ones, which are inserted on the axis at distinct inter- 
vals.
"Within the palea, or apparently between the flowering 
glume and the palea, is the real flower, consisting usually of 2 
minute, almost microscopical scales called lodicules, of 3 (rarely 
2 or 6) stamens, and of a 1-celled, 1-ovuled ovary, crowned by 2 
more or less feathery styles.
The name of flower, however, is 
here, as in other works, generally meant to include the flowering 
glume and palea.
Fruit 1-seeded and seed-like, called a grain or 
caryopsis, consisting of the real seed and pericarp, either free or 
adhering to the persistent palea, or enclosed in the more or less 
hardened flowering glume and palea, or in the outer glumes.
Embryo small, at the base of a mealy albumen.
Such is the general plan upon which the flowers of Grasses are 
arranged, but there are many variations which require to be carefully 
attended to in discriminating the genera of this most natural, but some- 
what difficult family.
Where the spikelet contains but one flower, its 
flowering glume and inner palea appear often almost opposite to each 
other, like an inner pair of glumes within the outer empty ones.
Sometimes there are three or even more outer, empty glumes, either 
passing gradually into the shape of the flowering ones, or one or two, 
very differently shaped (usually much smaller), are placed between the 
outer empty pair and the flowering one ; or the axis of the spikelet 
terminates in one or more rudimentary, empty glumes.
Occasionally 
one flower, either below or above the perfect one, has stamens only, 
and some exotic species are always monoecious or dioecious.
Fre- 
quently the midrib of the flowering glumes alone, or of the interme- 
diate empty ones alone, or of all the glumes, is prolonged into a bristle, 
sometimes very long, called an awn, and this awn is either terminal, 
proceeding from the point of the glume or from a notch at the top, or 
is inserted lower down, on its back, or at its very base.
Sometimes 
the whole spikelet contains only two glumes, one empty, the other 
flowering, with or even without a palea, or is reduced to a single flowering

ing glume and palea.
Many botanists restrict the name of glume to 
the outer empty pair, calling both the flowering glumes and their palea, 
paleas or glumellas, and giving the name of sterile florets to all other 
empty glumes in the spikelet, or even to a small prolongation of the 
axis which is often observable at the outer base of the palea of the 
terminal flowers.
The leaves of Grasses are frequently described as 
convolute, that is, rolled inwards on the edges, but this character is 
often very deceptive in dried specimens, for in many species the leaves 
are perfectly flat when growing, but roll inwards in drying immediately 
on being gathered.
Grasses are abundantly diffused over the whole world, from the 
utmost limits of phsenogamous vegetation towards the Poles or on 
alpine summits, to the burning plains of the Equator.
In temperate 
regions they form the principal mass of the green carpeting of the soil, 
whilst in tropical regions some species (the Bamboos) attain the height 
of tall trees.
They supply us with one of the most important articles 
of food for man, in the shape of grain, and for cattle as constituting the 
chief portion of meadows and pastures.

The limits of the numerous genera into which Grasses are divided 
are as yet far from being definitively fixed.
Some are by no means 
natural, and those which are so have not always any definite charac- 
ters.
They have also been variously distributed into tribes, according 
to the special views of their structure entertained by different botanists.
Taking however those which are now the most generally adopted, the 
eight following Tribes are represented in Britain.
It will be observed, 
at the same time, that the short characters here given are by no means 
absolute, a few species (as, for instance, the common Leersia) being 
occasionally exceptional, or even in apparent contradiction to the 
general character of the tribe in which they are placed.

Among the exotic genera occasionally cultivated in our fields or 
gardens may be mentioned Rye (Secale cereale), the Maize or Indian 
Corn {Zea Mays), and the Feather- grass (Stipa pennata).
The latter 
plant, a native of southern Europe, has by some mistake been inserted 
in some British Moras as having been found in Westmoreland.

A small genus, chiefly American, with 2 or 3 of the species spread 
over the warmer regions of the old world and Australia.
It is doubt- 
ful whether in this and other genera of Oryzece the inner glume should 
be considered as an anomalous palea, or as the flowering glume without 
any palea.

branched, spreading, 6 or 8 inches long, 
but in the British specimens usually 
much shorter, and partially included in

spike or spike-like panicle more compact 
and regularly cylindrical, 1 to 1J inches 
long, with very numerous projecting 
bristles.
These are but slightly rough 
with minute erect teeth, so as only to be 
felt as the spike is pushed upwards 
through the fingers.
Spikelets rather 
larger than in the rough P.
; the second 
glume rather shorter than the third, the 
flowering one marked with numerous 
transverse wrinkles, visible especially 
as the seed ripens.
One of the commonest weeds of cul-

one has no transverse wrinkles.
With the same geographical range as 
the glaucous JP., this is, however, much 
less common in tropical countries, but 
more so in central Europe, extending 
eastward all across Russian Asia, and 
northward into southern Scandinavia.
In Britain, it is also rather better esta- 
blished in the south of England than 
the other species, except the glabrous P.

prominence of the nerv r es of the glumes 
and the roughness of their keel, and in 
other minute particulars ; but all at-

next the axis of the spike.
Outer empty glumes 2, similar to the

To this genus belong the cultivated Wheats, all annuals, of uncertain 
origin, by some said to be indigenous in some little-known regions of 
western Asia, by others believed to be altered forms of the common 
south European and west Asiatic Grasses known under the generic 
name of JEgilojps.
The British wild species are all perennials, and 
form part of a different section, distinguished by some as a separate 
genus, under the name of Agrojpyron, which should be adopted if it be 
definitively ascertained that the annual Wheats are identical with 
JEgilops.

Many of the forms assumed by this ubiquitous species, difficult as they 
are to distinguish, and passing gradually one into another, have been 
universally recognized as species, although with characters very diffe- 
rently marked out by different authors.
The most prominent among 
the British ones are : — 
a. Eye-like field B.
(B.
secalinus, Eng. Bot, t.
1171.) A tall, corn- 
field variety, with a loose, more or less drooping panicle, the flowers 
not so closely imbricated, becoming quite distinct and spreading when 
in fruit, most of these differences arising from being cultivated with 
the corn.
b. Soft field B.
{B.
mollis, Eng. Bot.

monest forms, in open, waste places, with a more erect panicle, either 
short and compact, or long and slender, and the whole plant softly 
downy.
c. Smooth Field B.

variety, but much more glabrous.
d. Many -flowered field B.

cludes either of the preceding varieties, when the flowers are more 
numerous than usual in the spikelet.

There are two marked 
varieties often considered as species, the 
true F.
Myurus, with a panicle of about 
3 inches, the flowering glumes nearly as 
long as their awn, the lowest empty 
glume about 2 lines long, the second at 
least 3 lines, and both very pointed ; 
and the bromelilce F.
(F.
bromoides), 
with the panicle much longer and more 
slender, the flowering glumes smaller, 
thinner, and much shorter than their 
awns, the outermost empty glume not 
line 1 long, the second about 2 lines.

POA.
Spikelets several-flowered (rarely only 2- flowered), awnless, nume- 
rous, in a spreading or compact panicle.
Outer glumes rather unequal, 
usually keeled.
Flowering glumes obtuse or pointed, but not awned, 
scarious at the top, either keeled from the base or at the top only, or 
rounded to the top without any prominent keel.
A large genus, widely spread over all parts of the world.
Although 
in many respects a natural one, its characters and limits are far from 
precise.
It differs from Fescue only in its shorter glumes, without 
awns or decided points, and some species have been placed alternately 
in the one or the other genus.
The first seven species are frequently 
separated, and formed into one, two, or more genera, characterized by 
minute differences in the nerves of the glumes or in the shape of the 
minute floral scales, or of the seed ; and on the other hand, Catabrose, 
Molinia, Triodia, Coclc's-foot, and Kceleria, although universally ad- 
mitted, are distinguished by characters of very little more value.
In 
the present state of our acquaintance with the most practical principles 
of classification in Grasses, the limits of Foa, as retained in the British 
Flora, appear to be the most natural.

The species, though not numerous, are very conspicuous in the tem- 
perate and warmer climates both of the new and the old world, and 
form a natural genus if considered as including, as well our northern 
species, often separated under the name of Phragmites, as the South 
American Pampas Grass, recently introduced into our gardens, and 
generically distinguished under the name of Gynerium, on account of its 
flowers usually (but, it is said, not always) dioecious.

Class III.
CRYPTOGAMS.
No real flowers, that is, neither stamens, nor pistils, nor true 
seeds, the fructification consisting of minute, often highly micro- 
scopic granules, called Spores, variously enclosed in sessile or 
stalked capsules, or imbedded within the substance of the plant, 
the capsules themselves sometimes so small as to be scarcely 
visible without the aid of a microscope.
The few British Cryptogams which are included in the present 
work have all of them roots, and stems or rootstocks, very similar in 
structure to those of some Monocotyledons, and in some the leaves 
are also nearly the same, but in others the leaves are more or less 
converted into fruiting branches, bearing the fructification on their 
surface or edges, and are therefore now generally distinguished from 
true leaves by the name of fronds.
In the remaining families of 
Cryptogams, called Cellular, there is either no distinct stem, or the 
stem does not contain any fibres or vascular tissue.
None of these can 
be readily determined wihout the use of high magnifying powers, and

the assistance of carefully executed plates.
However great, therefore, 
may be the interest attached to them, they are beyond the scope of the 
present Flora ; and the amateur of British Botany, desirous of entering 
into their study, is referred to the works of Hooker, Wilson, Harvey, 
Berkeley, and others, devoted each to particular families.
These Cel- 
lular Cryptogams are comprised in the five following families : — 
Mosses.
Stem and leaves distinct, but without vessels.
Spores 
contained in little globular or awn-shaped capsules, which are usually 
pedicellate, and open by the falling off of a lid at the top.
Hepaticje.
Stem and leaves sometimes like those of Mosses, some- 
times reduced to flat, leaf-like expansions.
Spores contained in little 
capsules, either stalked, as in the Mosses, but opening in valves, or 
immersed in the substance of the frond.
Lichens.
Plants consisting of a variously-shaped flat, or shortly 
erect expansion called the thallus, not usually green, but turning 
greenish if rubbed, sometimes so thin as not to be distinguished but by 
colour from the stones or bark they grow on.
Fructification in little 
shield-like or wart-like bodies on the surface of the thallus.
Fungi.
Plants of infinite variety of shape and colour, but not green 
even when rubbed, usually growing on decaying organized substances, 
often themselves microscopic, and their fructification always so.
They 
include Mushrooms, Moulds, Mildews, Dry-rot, Vinegar Plants, etc.
AjjGM.
Aquatic plants, entirely submerged, variously coloured ; 
the fructification usually imbedded in the substance of the frond, and 
almost always microscopic.
They include the Seaweeds, the fresh- 
water Confervas, and according to some authors the Char as also, which 
in the short, whorled branches of their fronds show some approach to 
the Equisetum family, but they float like the Atyce, and have axillary 
fructifications.
LXXXVIII.
CLUBMOSS FAMILY.
LYCOPODIACEiE.
Leaves radical or alternate, undivided in the British genera.
Spores enclosed in capsules, sessile or nearly so, either at the 
base or in the axils of the leaves, or forming a terminal spike in- 
terspersed with leaf-like bracts.

Stock very short, rooting at the base, bearing a tuft of linear leaves, 
the whole plant usually under water.
Capsules more or less enclosed 
within the enlarged base of the leaves, those of the outer leaves filled 
with minute powdery granules, those of the inner leaves containing 
larger grains, at first cohering in fours.
A small genus, widely spread over the greater part of the globe.

A perennial, of a bright green, forming 
dense tufts under the water.
Leaves 
narrow-linear, much like those of several 
Monocotyledons, varying from 2 to 6 
inches long, their enlarged bases giving 
the plant often a bulbous appearance.
In mountain pools, and shallow lakes, 
in central and northern Europe, northern 
and Arctic Asia, and JN"orth America.
In 
Britain, in the mountainous parts of 
Scotland, northern England, Wales, and 
Ireland.

dern botanists distinguish as a species 
under the name of I.
echinospora, a form 
found in our mountain lakes, often grow- 
ing with the common one, but said to be 
only where the soil is peaty.
It differs 
chiefly in the larger spores covered with 
acute tubercles instead of being granu- 
late only or nearly smooth on the surface.
A rather more distinct-looking form re- 
ferred by Hooker to I.
Du-ricei (Fig.
1241) and by Babington to I.
hystrix, 
occurs in moist sandy hollows on Lan- 
cresse Common in Guernsey.
The root- 
stock is covered outside the tuft of leaves 
with a number of small imbricate toothed 
or jagged brown scales, which are the 
persistent remains of old leaves, and 
which are never observed in the common 
under-water forms.
It remains to be 
seen how far this difference may be owing 
to situation.

LXXXIX.
EQUISETUM FAMILY.
EQUISETACE.E.
A family consisting of a single genus, distinguished from all 
others as well by the articulate steins and whorled branches, only 
resembling some of the larger fossil plants now extinct, as by the 
fructification.
I. EQUISETUM.
EQUISETUM.
Leafless herbs, with a perennial, usually creeping rootstock, and 
erect, rush-like, hollow, and jointed stems, marked with longitudinal 
EQUIStiTACE^E.
1025 
striae or furrows, with a sheath at each joint which encloses the base of 
the next internode, and is bordered with short or elongated teeth, usually 
as many as the striae of the stem.
These stems are either simple or 
have at each node, from the base of the sheath, a whorl of jointed 
branches similar to the stem, but with fewer striae, and always simple, 
except in the tvood JE.
Fructification an ovoid or oblong terminal 
spike, consisting of several whorls of peltate, shield-shaped, shortly- 
stalked scales (usually brown or black), under each of which are several 
(about 6 or 7) capsules, filled with minute spores and opening down 
the inner side.
Under the microscope there will be seen to be attached 
to each spore at its base 4 thread-like filaments, club-shaped at the top, 
rolled spirally round thesporewhen moist, uncoiling elastically when dry.
The species are not numerous, although widely diffused over the 
temperate and colder regions of the northern hemisphere, extending 
more sparingly into tropical countries.
Some of them accommodate 
themselves to a great variety of stations and become very variable.
To 
determine them it is not only necessary to have the fruiting stem, but 
also to observe whether the plant bears or not barren fronds at the 
same time, and whether these are similar or dissimilar to the fruiting 
ones.
Accidental variations must also be guarded against.
The side 
branches sometimes bear spikes, or shoots similar to these side branches 
may arise from the stock, and if gathered alone, without observing the 
more ordinary state of the stems, may become very puzzling.
Fruiting stems, in spring, simple, thick, with long, loose 
sheaths, and withering before the barren ones appear.
Sheaths of the fruiting stems more than an inch long, with 
numerous subulate teeth .
1. Great E.
Sheaths under an inch, distant from each other, with 
about 8 or 10 lanceolate teeth .
. 2.
Field E.
Fruiting stems appearing in or lasting till summer, at the 
same time as the barren ones, and nearly similar to 
them.
Sheaths with few lanceolate lobes.
Branches of the stem 
again branched at the nodes (in the fruiting stems 
appearing often after the fruiting lias commenced) .
3. Wood E.
Sheaths with short or subulate teeth.
Spike very obtuse.
Striae of the stem, and teeth of the sheaths numerous 
(usually 15 to 20).
Branches few in each whorl or none.
Stems mostly 
fruiting and similar £.
Smooth E.
Branches of the barren stems numerous in each 
whorl.
Fruiting stems simple at first, the 
branches growing out afterwards 4.
Shady E.
Angles of the stem and teeth of the sheaths few 
(rarely more than 8) 6.
Marsh E.
1026 
THE EQUISETUM FAMILY.
Spike terminating in a short point or minute cone.
Stems usually simple.
Whorled branches none or 
very rare.
Stems tall, with numerous (usually 15 to 20) stria 
and sheath-teeth 7.
Rough E.
Stems low and slender, often tufted, with few 
(usually 8 to 10) stria?
and sheath-teeth ...
9. Variegated E.
Stems, at least the central one, with whorled branches.
Striae and sheath- teeth few (usually 8 to 12) .
8. Long E.
1. Great Equisetum.
Equisetum Telmateia, Ehrh.
(Fig. 1249.) 
{E.flumatile, Eng. Bot.
t. 2022.) 
The fruiting stems appear alone early 
in spring, they are quite simple, 8 or 10 
inches high, as thick as a finger, of a pale- 
brown colour ; the sheaths rather loose, 
an inch long or more, completely cover- 
ing the stem from one joint to the next, 
of a dark brown, marked with 20 to 30 
or more longitudinal stria?, and fringed 
with as many long, subulate teeth, or 
half as many, these teeth being often 
joined 2 and 2 together.
Spike fully 2 
inches long, the lower whorls of scales 
often distinct.
Barren stems appearing 
after the fruiting ones have withered 
away, often several feet high, white, with 
the tips of the sheaths black ; the long, 
crowded, slender branches very nume- 
rous in each whorl.
In marshy, shady, wet, or gravelly 
places, in temperate Europe, not extending northward into Scandinavia, 
nor perhaps southward into Spain, but eastward to Greece and the 
Caucasus, and thence all across Eussian Asia, and in North America.
Common in the greater part of England and Ireland, but not pene- 
trating far into Scotland.
Fr. early spring.

tance from each other, and have seldom 
more than about 10 lanceolate teeth, and 
are dark only in the upper part.

spreading branches, about 10 to 12 in 
each whorl ; these are sometimes slightly 
branched, but never regularly so as in

like the barren ones.
Sheaths about half 
an inch long, divided into about 6 or 8 
lanceolate, scarious lobes, broader than 
in our other Fquisetums.
Spike about 
6 to 8 lines long, obtuse.
Branches, both 
of the barren and fertile stems, 10 to 16 
or more in a whorl, very slender, but not 
above 2 or 3 inches long, and remark- 
able for bearing, at the lower nodes at 
least, whorls of 2, 3, or more smaller 
branches, which gives the plant a very 
elegant tufted appearance.
In wet woods, and shady places, in 
temperate and northern Europe and 
Russian Asia, from northern Italy and 
the Caucasus to the Arctic regions, and 
in iS'orth America.
Spread all over

Very near the rough E., with the same 
little conical point to the spike, and very 
probably a mere variety, differing only 
in its slender stems, with only 8 to 12 or 
seldom more striae ; the sheaths have 
seldom any black ring round the base,

THE FERN FAMILY.
FILICES.
Herbs, with a perennial, short, or tufted, or creeping rootstock 
(in some exotic species growing up into a tall, woody stem), or 
rarely annual ; with radical or alternate leaves, which, as they also 
partake of the nature of branches, are distinguished by the name 
of fronds.
In most genera these fronds are, when young, rolled 
inwards at the top, and the rootstock, and sometimes also the 
stalks of the fronds, are more or less covered with brown, scarious, 
usually pointed scales.
Fructification consisting of capsules, 
called spore-cases {sporangia), sometimes small and almost dust- 
like, arranged either in clusters, called sori, on the under surface 
of the frond, and often covered when young, with a thin membrane, 
called the indusium, or in little involucres on the margin of the 
frond ; sometimes rather larger, in spikes or panicles at the top of 
the frond, which has, lower down, either leafy branches or one 
leaf.
These capsules open in various ways to discharge the minute, 
usually microscopical spores.
A very large Order, abundantly diffused over the whole surface of 
the globe, especially in moist climates, although some species may be 
found in the chinks of the hottest rocks.
The elegance of their foliage 
has of late years attracted as much interest in them on the part of cul- 
tivators and amateurs, as has their fructification and germination on 
the part of the physiologist.
It has long been known that they can be 
reproduced from their spores, but it has only lately been ascertained 
that these spores when sown are developed into minute, green, leafy 
expansions, called prothalli, which alone have any analogy to the 
flowers of other plants.
For on the prothallus are produced, minute 
bodies, which have been compared to stamens and pistils, from whence 
the young Fern is subsequently developed.
The spore may, under 
this theory, be said to be a young flower-bud, which only opens after it 
has fallen, the spore-case being an involucre enclosing innumerable 
buds, and the sorus a whole inflorescence.
The limitation of genera and species in the Ferns has always been 
a matter of great difficulty, and of late years their splitting and chan- 
ging has been carried to such a degree as to throw the whole nomencla- 
ture into a state of utter confusion.
The best characters are taken 
from the form and arrangement of the sori and of their indusium ; and 
some large genera, such as Adiant, Spleenwort, etc., are natural, and 
readily recognized ; but in Polypody, Shield- Fern, Bladder- Fern, etc., 
1032 THE FERN FAMILY.
there is nothing in habit to serve as a guide, and the indusium of the 
two latter genera is often so evanescent that it requires the most care- 
ful examination of specimens, in exactly the proper state, to ascertain 
its existence.
I have been induced, therefore, with a view to assist the 
beginner in the determination of the British species, to include in the 
following Table of Genera the species also of the most difficult ones, 
endeavouring to lead to them by more prominent characters, without 
reference to the more minute, although essential ones, which distinguish 
the genera.
It must be recollected, however, that to determine Ferns 
they must be in fruit.
It is hopeless to attempt to find out by books 
to what species a barren frond belongs, and monstrous developments, 
and deformed fronds, now not uncommon in cultivation, and found 
occasionally wild, are here wholly passed over.*

riety, only differing from the common 
form in its small size, the slender stems 
varying from 1 to 3 inches, the leaf linear 
or lanceolate, narrowed into a stalk, and 
seldom above 1| inches long.
It is usually to be found only in early 
spring, and in Europe chiefly near the sea, in the Mediterranean re- 
gion, and up the west coast of Europe to the Channel Islands, but 
not on the main British Lsles.

OSMUND.
OSMOTDA.
Fronds once or twice pinnate, the leafy part barren ; the fructifica- 
tion consisting of clustered spore-cases, either in a panicle at the end 
of the frond, or, in exotic species, in some other part of the frond, but 
always distinct from the leaf- like part ; each spore-case opening by a

of both hemispheres, especially the northern one.
1. Royal Osmund* Osmunda regalis, Linn.
(Fig. 1260.) 
(Eng. Bot.

The perennial stock often forms a trunk rising perceptibly from the 
ground, and sometimes to the height of a foot or more.
Fronds grow- 
ing in tufts, erect, from a foot or two in dry, poor soils, to 8 or 10 feet 
when very luxuriant, tw r ice pinnate, with lanceolate or oblong segments, 
1 to 2 inches long, rather stiff, prominently veined, either entire or

POLYPODY.
POLYPODIUM.
Fronds (in the British species) either pinnate or ternately divided, 
with the branches pinnate.
Spore-cases minute, collected in circular 
clusters or sori on the under side of the segments, without any indu- 
sium or involucre ; each spore-case (as in all the following genera) en- 
circled by an elastic jointed ring, and bursting irregularly on one side, 
having then, under a microscope, the appearance of a little helmet.
A large genus, widely distributed over the globe, only differing from 
Aspidium in the absence of any indusium or membrane covering the 
sori even when young.

the linear-oblong segments adhering to 
the main stalk and usually connected 
with each other by their broad bases.
Sori rather large, of a golden-yellow, in 
two rows along the under side of the 
upper segment.
When bearing fruit 
these segments are usually entire or 
nearly so, and obtuse ; when barren they 
are often slightly toothed; and mon- 
strous states not un frequently occur 
with the segments variously lobed or 
branched.
In sheltered places, on trunks of old

merous, oblong or lanceolate, deeply 
pinnatifid, and sharply toothed, the 
larger ones usually about half an inch 
long.
Sori circular, without any in- 
dusium whatever : this character alone 
distinguishes this plant from the 
smaller states of the lady Sjpleenwort 
and from some forms of the broad 
Shieldfern, which it closely resembles 
in all other respects.

SHIELDPERN.
ASPIDIUM.
Fronds (in the British species) once, twice, or thrice pinnate, with a 
stiff erect stalk, usually bearing, at least at the base, numerous brown 
scarious scales.
Sori circular as in Polypody, but covered when young 
by a membrane or indusium, attached by the centre or by a point near 
one side, so that, when raised all round by the growth of the spore- 
cases, it becomes either peltate or kidney-shaped.
A very large genus, ranging over every part of the globe, only dis- 
tinguished from Polypody by the indusium.
In modern British Fern- 
books it is usually divided into two, Lastrea and Polystiehum, accord- 
ing to whether the attachment of the indusium is central or towards 
the margin, a minute character, unconnected with habit, often difficult 
to appreciate, and sometimes inconstant.

Fronds tufted, arising from a short 
thick stock, 1 to 2 feet or rather more 
high, stiff, twice pinnate, broadly lan- 
ceolate in outline, with the lower pinnas 
decreasing in length ; the stalk below 
the leafy part 1 to 6 inches long, very

The stature, mode of growth in circu- 
lar tufts, and the general shape of the 
frond are those of the male S., from 
which it may be distinguished by a 
lighter colour, especially of the stalk, 
and by the lobes or segments of the pin- 
nas all quite entire, with the small sori 
in a line near the margin as in the marsh 
5. From the latter it differs in its lar- 
ger size, the stalk bearing brown sca- 
rious scales, the pinnas so closely ses- 
sile as almost to lap over the central 
stalk ; and from both this species may 
be known by the minute resinous or 
glandular dots on the under side of the 
fronds, from whence a fragrant smell is 
imparted to the plant when rubbed.

Fronds handsome, in a large circular 
tuft, 2 or 3 feet high, stiff and erect, 
broadly lanceolate, with the lower pin-

The most variable of all our Shield- 
ferns, allied to the male S., but gene- 
rally not so tall, of a paler green, and 
very much broader ; the general outline 
nearly ovate, 1 to 2 feet long or rarely

The frond is also more divided, either 
twice pinnate, with the segments of the 
pinnas oblong-lanceolate and deeply 
toothed, or pinnatifid, or thrice pinnate ; 
it then closely resembles the lady Spleen- 
wort and the alpine Polypody, but may 
be generally distinguished by the lower 
pinnas not decreasing so much in size, 
and more accurately by the sori, which 
are circular, with a kidney-shaped in-

much smaller, and when mature the in- 
dusium often disappears.

stone districts of northern England, but 
said to occur also in western England 
and Ireland.

they certainly appear (when seen growing in profusion) to pass, through 
numerous intermediate forms.

SPLEENWORT.
ASPLENIUM.
Fronds (in the British species) once, twice, or thrice pinnate or 
forked, usually rather stiff, though slender, and often small.
Sori ob- 
long or linear, on the under surface, usually diverging from near the 
centre of the segments, covered when young by a membrane or in- 
dusium, which opens cutwards, being attached lengthwise along the 
outer side.
Widely dispersed over the globe, and one of the most natural among 
the large genera of Ferns, for although a few of the larger species are 
scarcely to be distinguished from some species of Aspidium and Poly- 
pody, except by the sori, the great majority have a peculiar dark-green, 
smooth appearance, which makes them easy to recognize.

mountain districts of the old world, es- 
pecially in the southern hemisphere ; 
more rare in America, extending from 
the Canary Islands and north-western 
Africa along western Europe to Belgium 
and JSTorway, but not recorded from 
eastern Europe or any part of the Rus- 
sian dominions, nor from Ts orth America.
Generally distributed over the greater 
part of Britain, but more frequent in 
Scotland, northern and western England, 
and Ireland, than in eastern England.
Fr, summer and autumn.
A variety 
with the valves of the involucre entire, 
not toothed, is usually distinguished as a 
species, under the name of H.
unilaterale 
orH.Wilsoni,Y\g.
1295 (Eng. Bot.
Suppl.
t. 2686), but the other characters, said to 
accompany this one, such as the narrower 
involucres, the different direction of the 
lobes of the fronds, etc., do not appear to 
me to be so constant as they are supposed to be, and the teeth of the 
valves, when present, are very variable.
The entire-valved form is the 
most common in Scotland and Ireland, but the two are often intermixed.
