OF 
PLANTS.
The study of the Geography of Plants, drongh an in- 
teresting and important branch of Botany, has but lately 
engaged the attention of naturalists.
A few detached 
hints on the subject are to be met with in the writings of 
Linnaeus, who observes, that " the difBtrent kinds of 
plants, show by their stations the perpendicular height 
of the earth," and some unconnected facts are scattered 
through the works of the older botanists ; but no author 
had collected and combined these isolated facts, for the 
purpose of ascertaining the elevation or depression of 
country and temperature of climate indicated by these 
means.
Of late years, Wahlenberg, Von Bucb, De 
CandoUe, Humboldt, Homemann, and Schouw have 
made rapid progress in this department of the science, 
distributing the vegetables of Lapland, Norway, Sweden, 
Denmark, Switzerland, the Carpathian Alps, France, 
and even of America, Africa, and Asia, in the most com- 
prehensive and masterly manner; yet the Flora of Eng- 
land, though well known and admirably described, has 
not been subjected to this mode of arrangement.
The 
inaugural Thesis of Dr. Bou^, printed at Edinburgh in 
181 7) is a tract of considerable merit, and serves to 
throw much light on the general localities of the Scotch 
plants; and Mr. Brown's Memoir on the Flora of the 
Southern Hemisphere, published as an appendix to Capt.
Flinders's voyage, cannot be too highly praised.
The 
writings of these celebrated authors are mentioned 
merely with a view of pointing out the strides this branch 
of science has made within a short period, eq)ecially on 
the continent.
The notes now submitted to your con- 
sideration are of much humbler pretensions, embracing 
the limited extent of the three northern English coun- 
ties, and must, therefore, be considered only as a frag- 
ment; but which, it is hoped, may ultimately prove 
useful to some naturalist, who shall dedicate his time 
and abilities tp this neglected department of British 
Botany.
England, in the parallel 55^ North, which passes the 
district now under consideration, is scarcely- 70 miles 
broad.
Its most elevated mount^ns, according to Co- 
lonel Mudge's survey, are Sea Fell, 8,166 feet in height; 
Helvellin, 3,053 feet; and Skiddaw, 3,022 feet, among 
the Grauwacke, Porphyry, and Slate bills of Cumber- 
land: to these succeed Cross Fell, 2,901 feet, in the 
Encrinal limestone range, which commencing in 
Northumberland, terminates in Derbyshire, and is 
sometimes denominate the English Apennines; next 
the Syenitic and Greenstone hills of Cheviot, 2,658 feet, 
and Hegehope, 2,347 feet, situated in the north of 
Northumberland, and Simonside, some miles to the 
south of the latter, in the Encrinal limestone dis- 
trict, 1,407 feet; then Pontop Pike, 1,018 feet, on the 
western border of the Newcastle coal formation : and 
lastly, Brandon mount, 875 feet, and Warders Law, 
632 feet, in the Magnesian limestone, and not far dis- 
tant from the eastern coast This tract of country pos- 
sesses a Flora of 1,087 Phsenogamous, and 1,253 Cryp- 
togamic plants, of which between forty and fifly are pe- 
culiar to Cumberland; 
Among the Phasnogamous plants are comprised :â€” ^

After taking a general survey of the femilies of vege- 
tables with which this part of the island is cloathed, it 
may not be amiss to make some cursory remarks on a 
few of the most valuable and well known species; of 
these the Oak first claims our attention.
In the 
6 
sheltered vales of Tyne, Derwent, and Tees, it attains a 
large si^e, and may be considered as tmly indigenous ; 
for enormous trunks and branches are dug out of all the 
peat mosses which are not situated at a very co|isidera<- 
ble elevation above the levels of the rivers; and this 
phenomenon occurs even among the recesses of Ae 
Cheviot momitains, a district which is now destitute of 
oaks.
In Weardale and Teesdale, trees of stunted 
growth may be traced to the elevation of 1,600 or 
1,700 feet above the level of the sea.
The river Dall, 
in Sweden, in lat.
60^ 30.
north, and Christiana in 
Norway, in 59^ 56Â» appear to be the northern limits of 
this valuable timber ; but the Oaks which I have noticed 
on the banks of the Gotha, in lat 58^ were of very di- 
minutive size.
The common Elm of the southern counties of Eng- 
land (Ulmus campestris) is certainly not indigenous 
north of the Tees ; and, of course, I connot help su^ 
pecting that the Elm mentioned by Von Buch, as grow- 
ing in the vicinity of Christiana, and by Wahlenberg 
to the north of the Lake Venner, in Vermland, will 
prove to be the Wych Elm (Ulmus montana), or pos- 
sibly the smooth leaved Elm (Ulmus glabra of Eng.
Bot).
Even in sheltered plantations, on the east side of 
the island, the common Elm does not attain to a consi- 
derable size, though in Cumberland it becomes a large 
tree> and is much cultivated; but the Wydi Elm is 
abundant in every hedge, and, together with.
the smooth 
leaved Elm, skirts our moors at the height of 2,000 feet 
The Beech (Fagus sylvestris) and Aspen (Populus 
tremula) are truly natives; the former does not climb 
the hills to the same height as the Oak^ but flourishes 
beautifully in the vales.
Von Buch assigns the river 
Gotha as the nojrthern boundary of the Beech, and the 
province of Halland, in Sweden, as that of the Aspen 
and black Poplar (Populus nigra).
Lightfoot doubts 
whether either the white (Populus alba) or the black 
Poplar are natives of Scotland (see pp.
616 and 618^; 
nor have I ever seen these trees in a natural wood in 
the north of England, though the former is remarkable 
for withstanding the north easterly winds, so highly 
detrimental to v^etation on the coast of Northumber- 
land and Durham.
The Lime (Tilia eqropaea), the 
Chesnut (Fagus Castanea), and the Hornbeam (Car- 
pinus Betulus) stand in the same predicament 
Large Holly trees (Ilex Aquifolium) are among the 
chief ornaments of many woods in the county of Dur- 
ham, as at Ravensworth and Gibside, and in the vicinity 
of Bamardcastle, also near Alnwick, in Northumberland^ 
^nd throughout the whole county of Cumberland ; as is 
the Yew (Taxus baccata), to the banks of the Allen, of 
the Irthing at Wardrew, the Derwent in Bprrowdale^ 
and to the white calcareous cliÂ£& in the romantic Dene 
at Castle Eden.
On the margins of the Cumberland and 
Westmoreland lakes, the Birch (Betula alba) equals in 
size and beauty the Birches in Norway and Sweden; 
but it is not found on the mountains higher than the 
Sycamore (Acer Pseudoplatanus), which in these sub- 
alpine regions is quite at home, as well as on the moun- 
tainous sheep pastures between Kirby-stephen and Sed- 
burgh; it has besides the valuable property of flourish- 
ing on the sea coast On our hills, too, may be seen 
& 
the Mountaia AÂ»h (Pyriis aocuparia); hat the White 
Beam (Pyrus Aria) may be traced from the High Force 
of Tees to the coast^ proTided the s6il rests upon lime- 
atone rocks.
The Alder (Alain gkitinosa) and Marsh 
Elder (Viburnum (^)ulus) accompany every stream, 
and the Hazel (Corylus Avellana), Blade Cherry 
(Prunus Cerasus), Bird Cherry (Prunus Padus), the 
l^indle tree (Euonymus eurcqisetis), the Raspbeiry (Ru- 
bus idaeus), the common Elder (Sambueus nigra), are 
found in all the woods from the sea shore to those situÂ« 
ated at an elevation of 1,600 feet; but the common 
Maple (Acer campestre) occurs only in the hedges of 
the flat country which surrounds DarHngton, and in 
the vicinity of Norton, 
The Ash (Frafxinus excelsior), and White Thorn 
(Mespilus Oxyacantha), as well as the less useful Crab 
tree (Pjrus Malus), and Kaek Thom (Prunus spinosa) 
abound throi^ the whole district; but the BuUace 
tree (Prunus insititia) is extrerady rare in Northumber- 
land Of DtO'ham, though more frequent in hedges near 
Carlisle; and the Humb tree (Prunus domestica).
Pear 
tree (Pjnrus communis), red Currant (Ribe rubrum), 
the Barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and Gooseberry (Ribes* 
Grossularia) though now of frequent occurrence, I sus- 
pect were not origbially natives of the soil.
The five 
following shrubs are certainly indigenous: the rock 
Currant, (Ribes petraeum), acid mountain Currant 
(Ribes spicatum), alpine Currant (Ribes alpimum), 
black Currant (Ribes nigrum), and Privet (Ligustrum 
vulgare); but the upright Honey Suckle (Lonicem 
^ylosteum), which stands on the authority of Wallis, 
as growing on the rocks at Shewing Shields, should be 
expunged from our Flora.
On the elevated moors between Blancbland, at the 
head of the Derwent, and Wolsingham, on the river 
Wear,* and even on the mountains of Cross Fell, at 
an elevation of nearly 3000 feet, the roots and trunks of 
very large Pines (Pinus sylvestris) are seen protruding 
^om the black peat moss, being exposed to view by the 
water of these bogs having drained off and left the peat 
bare; but this tree is no longer indigenous with us.
It 
may be worthy of remark, that the Scotch Fir does not 
at this day attain the size of these ancient Pines, though 
planted in similar moorland situations, even though the 
young trees be protected, and the plantations situated at 
a lower level.
In favourable situations, as by the Eden at 
Corby, in Cumberland, some large trees may be noticed ; 
but on moorland soils, wh6re it foimerly flourished, it 
iseldom thrives after thirty or forty years of age, aiid, 
spreading its roots horizontally, it is very liable to be 
blown up by violent winds.
The Spruce Fir (Pinus 
Abies) appears never to have been a native of this island, 
though the woods on the continent of Europe, both to 
the north and south of Britain, abound with it.
In lowland situations it is impossible to ascertain the 
native from the exotic Willows; having remarked 
the blue Willow (Salix caerulea) in the Highlands of 
Scotland, I conclude it may be indigenous here; but I 
apprehend the golden Willow (Salix vitollina) has been 
brought to us from the south of Europe.
On the banks 
* This is the only spot in Britain where G^Tophora glabra of 
Achariua has been detected in fructification, 
C 
10 
of our sab*alpine rivuletB is the true locality of Salix 
Croweana, not in the hedges of Norfolk {see Eng. Bot.) 
The Weeping Willow, n native of Syria and Chaldaea, 
never ripens its wood, and, of course, never flowers, in 
the north.
The Furze (Ulex europaeus) when it can no longer exÂ«Â» 
ist on open exposed moors, may be still found in seques- 
tered Denes at a height of 2000 feet; and in similar 
situations the growth of our most common Brambles, 
Rubus corylifdius, Rubus glandulosus, and Rubut 
fruticosus, terminates where they are all but Ev^^eens, 
and where the fronds of many Fema survive the seve- 
rity of our winters.
On the Fyall Alps, in Lapland, 1,400 feet below the 
line of perpetual snow, Wahlenberg noticed the fol- 
lowing shrubs: â€” Salix glauca, Betula nana, Juniperus 
communis, Salix hastata.
Arbutus alpina, Andromeda 
caerulea, Andromeda poiifolia, and Rubus chamaemorus; 
and at 600 feet higher, Salix lanata, Salix myrsinites^ 
Azalea procumbens, Azalea lapponica, Yiccinium uligi- 
nosum, and Empetrum nigrum.
It may not be amiss 
to compare these plants with those of a similar descrip* 
tion found at 2,000 or 8,000 feet elevation in this lati* 
tude : Salix glauca, Betula nana.
Arbutus alpina, Salix^ 
myrsinites, Azalea procumbens, Andromeda caerulea, 
and Salix lanata, do not reach us, though natives of the 
Scotch Highlands.
Azalea lq>ponica and Salix hastata 
are foreign to Britain ; but Juniperus communis may be 
traced from the coast to the mountains 1,500 feet in 
height; and Andromeda poiifolia, from the borders of 
Prestwick Carr, a few miles north west of Newcastle 
11 
at 9X1 elevation of 250 feet, to the Mackle Moss, near 
Shewing Shields, at 450 feet, Green Leighton Moss to 
the Wallington Moors, at 550 or 600, and to the moui>> 
tains in the vicinity of Keswick, at an elevation of 2,000 
feet above the level of the ocean.
Bubus Chama^morua 
flourishes on the Cheviots, on Simonside, on Cronkley 
jPell, and other moors in Teesdale, together with Em- 
pelTum nigrum ;* but Vaccinium uliginosum does not 
attain to so great an elevation.
In the place of Arbutus 
alpinaÂ» we have Arbutus Uva ursi, and instead of Salix 
lanata, a few scattered plants of Salix arenaria, on the 
Teesdale hills; and th<i summit of Skiddaw is covered 
with Salix herbacea, but without its usual atteodmtp 
S^x reticulata.
There appears something enigmatical in the causes 
which affect the growth of many exotic shrubs well 
known in gardens and plantations; for many natives 
of the north of Asia, Portugal, Japan, and even of 
South America, resist the severity of our winters much 
better than many which are indigepous in Italy, the 
South of France^ and Germany.
The strongest instan* 
jpes are those of the commop Myrtle,.
Pomegranate, and 
Oleander, all of which, though European plants, perish 
at a temperature no way injurious to the Rhododendron 
ponticum o( Asia Minor : this, as well as the Rhodo- 
dendron maximum of North America is mudi mor^ 
hardy than the Bay, or even than the Portugal Laurel ; 
* Vaccinium uliginosum occurs la Swiueriaiid^ in bogs situated 
at about 1,500 feet above the sur&ce of the sea, and also at a consi^r 
derable elevation on the Alps of St. Gottard GtemmiÂ» i&c.
where the 
iah^lntants (Alp colÂ») use it for fuelâ€” JoAn Hogg, Esq!^ MSS.
though is is probable the Pontic Rose-bay may be a 
native of the lower ridge of Caucasus, and the American 
species generally grows in subalpine situations.
From 
Pursh we Icam, that Rhododendron maximum, Â«, 
roseum, which is the variety common in our gardens, 
is found near rivulets and lakes, in the mountains from 
Canada to Carolina; /8, album, in the shady cedar 
swamps of New Jersey and Delaware ; y, purpureum, 
near lakes on the highest mountains of Virginia and Ca- 
rolina.
The author of the Flora of North America is 
inclined to think these three distinct species.
Rhodo- 
dendron punctalum is also from the mountains of Caro- 
lina, at the head of the Savannah river, and Rhododen- 
dron Catawbiense is a native of the high mountains of 
Virginia and Carolina, at the head of the Catawba 
river.
The Lapland, the Kamtschatkan, the two Swiss, 
and two Siberian Rosebays, are also alpine plants, and 
the same may be said of the rare species found on the 
mountains of Ceylon.
This may, in some measure, ac- 
count for these el^ant shrubs withstanding our severe 
and changeable winters, though they will not thrive in 
the fenny parts of Lincoln or Cambridgeshire, or in 
HoUand.
On the coasts of Greece, Albania, and Dalmatia, I 
have observed the limestone rocks covered with the Mas- 
tic (Pistacia Lentiscus) Myrde, Rosemary, Laurustinus, 
common Arbutus, and Juniper.
Of these, the first and 
second will not survive our winters; the third, fourth, 
and fifth will not perfect thehr fruit except in favourable 
situations, and when the season proves uncommonly 
mild ; but the last ascends our mountains to the height 
of fifteen hundred feet.
13 
^ In g^rd^is and well sheltered grounds, the common 
Laurel of the Levant (Prunus Laurocerasus) and Por- 
tugal Laurel (Prunus lusitanica) flower freely; and, 
provided the season be mild, ripen their fruit.
The 
Chinese Rose (Rosa semperflorens) and the cluster- 
flowered Quince, of Japan (Cydonia speciosa), when pro- 
tected by a wall, flower throughout open winters; and 
the latter has perfected its fruit at Wallington, and in 
similar situations.
Rosa mnltiflora of China, Buddlea 
globosa of Chili, Acuba japonica, Camelia japonica, and 
Corchorus japonica, survive our severest seasons, and 
thrive very well , but the Bay of Italy (Laurus nobilis) 
flowers only in the southernmost parts of Durham, and 
the sheltered vales of Cumberland.
On the other hand, the Provence Rose (Rosa centi- 
folia)and the ofiicinal Rose (Rosagallica), said to be from 
the south of France, but, most probably, originally from 
Asia Minor ; the Damask Rose (Rosa damascena), from 
the same country, are to be met with in every garden : 
nor is the Musk Rose (Rosa moschata) of the north of 
Africa very scarce.
The Roses of Siberia, the Alps, 
and North America, thrive very well, as does the Ever- 
green Rose (Rosa sempervirens) of Italy and Germany, 
a plant confounded by foreign botanists and British gar- 
deners with the white trailing Dog Rose (Hosa arvensis).
The double yellow Rose of the Levant (Rosa sulphurea) 
never flowers in the vicinity of Newcastle : ^d the same 
may be said of the single yellow Rose (Ro3aIutea) of the 
south of Europe, though it flourishes in the neighbour- 
hood of Hexham, 20 miles to the west, at Norton, in 
the south east of the county of Durham, and in the 
14* 
vicinity of the Cumberland lakes.
The white Rose of th# 
south of Europe (Rosa alba) has become naturalized 
in one spot on the banks of the Tyne.
I shall now briefly notice such exotic trees as succeed 
best with us in woods and plantations: the hoary-leaved 
Alder (Alnus incana) and the Norway Spruce (Pinus 
Abies), the Norway Maple (Acer Platanoidcs) from the 
north of Europe, the eliptic-leaved Alder (Alnus obloi^-* 
gata), the cluster Pine (Pinus Pinaster), the stone Pine 
(Pinus Pinea), the silver Fir (Pinus Picea), the Italian 
Maple (Acer Opalus), the evergreen Oak (Quercos 
Ilex), the Turkey Oak (QuercusCerris), with its varices 
t^e Fulhain and Lucombe Oaks, the Athenian Poplar 
(Populus graeca), and the Lombardy Poplar (Populus 
dOatata) of the south of Europe, the Larch (Pinus La- 
rix) of the Alps, the^ Cedar of Lebanon (Pinus Cedrus), 
the horse Chesnut (^sculus Hippocastanum J, the TarÂ«^ 
tarian Maple (Acer tartaricum), the oriental Plane Tree 
(Platanus orientalis), and Siberian Pine(PinifsCembra) 
from the north and north east of Asia; the notch Jeaved

* Seven different species of Fruit Trees ripen their fruit 
in the sou^m counties, which seldom do so in this la- 
titude : these are the Vine, the Fig, the Quince, the 
16 
Medlar, the Walnut, the Chesnut, and the MuB^rrf* 
This may be ascribed, in scnne measure, to thepreva-^ 
lence of cold easterly winds during the ^ting months, 
destroying the blossoms ; to the low temperature of our 
autumns, which prevents the young wood from harden- 
ing and maturing the buds enveloping the flowers in 
embryo, but more especially to the want of a contimK 
ance of sufficient heat during the summer, to bring tiie 
fruit, which is occasionally formed, to perfection ; for all 
these trees withstand the winter frost tolerably well in 
^lettered situations.
The Vine seldom flowers, and if 
by chance small grapes are produced, they soon drop ofÂ£ 
The Fig is seldom seen out of thehot*house^ or against a 
hot wall, and is otherwise barren, except in the south 
eastern comer of the county of Durham, and a few &Â» 
voured spots in Cumberland ; and speaking generally 
the same may be said of the Quince and Medlar, these 
flower freely, and the latter has ripened its fruit twice in 
twenty years, at Jesmond, near Newcastle.
The Wal- 
nut and Chesnut stand in the same predicament ; and 
even the Filbert bears very q)armgly.
The Mulberry is 
liere a low stunted tree, but in hot summers bears abun- 
dance of small fruit, which in part comes to maturity, 
and is well flavoured.
On traversing the wild and extensive moors of Dur* 
bam, Cumberland, and the south of Northumberland, 
an interesting phenomenon presents itsdf to view in nu- 
merous places : here the surface has been cast into equal 
ridges by the plough, though the land is now covered 
by heath, and agriculture has formerly flourished in 
situations so elevated as to preclude the possibility of 
17 
obtsining corn crops from them at the "present dÂ«y.
â€” 
Record and traditicm are alike silent respecting the eta 
when, and the people by whom, these districts were 
subjected to tillage; nor has any probable conjecture 
been started to throw light on this curious subject.
The most considerable delation above the level of the 
sea at which wheat is now cultivated, does not exceed a 
thousand feet.
Oats grow at nearly double that height ; 
but in unfavourable years the sheaves may frequently be 
seen standing among the snow, which not uncommonly 
covers tlie tops of the momitains in October, and is never 
later in foiling than the middle of November.
The sta- 
tions of Barley and Rye are between those of the Wheat 
and Oarts; but Bigg^ a more hardy grain than either of 
the former^ is no longer cultivated.* 
Turnips, but ci a small size, and Potatoes, grow at the 
same height as Oats; and our moors when newly broken 
up yield a good crop of Rape.
On the soil being turned 
overforthefirst time, and limeapplied, landsofdiisdescrip* 
tion produce White Clover (Trifolium rq^ens) in abun-Â« 
dance, a circumstance in no way satisfactorily accounted 
for, but which is known to take place in wastes both in 
Britain and North America (See Pursh's Flora Ameri- 
cana, vol.
ii.
p. 4*77)9 and probably in most other temperate 
Â« I was surprised to see Wheat growing at an elevadon of at least 
4,000 feet above the sea in the valley of Entreves in Piedmont, situ- 
ated at the southern base of Mont Blanc.
On each side of this val- 
ley I observed fields of wheat cultivated at the height of about 400 
feet upon the mountains which form the valley near the town of Cour- 
mayeur, which is, according to Ebel, 3,7^0 feet above the level of 
the sea.â€” Jb*Â« Hogg, JSsq*s MSS.

regions.
The white or cfnvan Poppy, which is cultivated 
on a large scale in Flanders, and die Tobacco^ which is 
to be met with as far to the n<Â»th a& Sw^en^ are here 
known only as ornaments to the flower garden^ 
Before dismissing those plants which are immediately 
subservient to use* a numerous but humble tribe of ve-* 
getables claims our attention: these are the Grasses^ 
Sedges^ and Rushes of various descriptions.
By the 
analytical table, it fq>pears we have no fewer than 176 
q)ecies, most of which are common to every part of 
Â£ur(^e ; for with the exception of aquatic plants, these 
productions of the temperate zone are wliore equally dis- 
seminated over the sur&ce of the globe than any other 
description of vegetables.
The more delicate of the 
grasses, not exceeding twenty in number, mixed with 
some few plants which are able to contend with them 
for possession of the soil, cover our meadows and pasture 
fields, while the strong-rooted, harsh-leaved Sedges, Cot- 
ton Grasses, Mat Grass, and small Club Rush, scantily 
clothe the elevated and boggy moorsof the Cheviots, where 
no other herbage is to be seen, and during, the summer 
months aflbrd pasturage to numerous flocks of sheep.
â€” 
The three common species of Heath â€” Calluna vulgaris.
Erica cinerea^ and Erica Tetralix, also give a peculiar 
character to the moors and fells in the north ; these flou* 
rish from 100 to 3,000 feet above the level of the sea, 
but never on a calcareous soil ; which circumstance oc- 
casions the striking difference between our heaths and 
the Yorkshire Wolds, but more especially the downs of 
the more southern counties, where the sub-stratum is 
chalk.

' The Foxglove, a plant, which has acquired conside- 
rable celebrity of late years for its medicinal virtues, is 
abundant in the county of Durham, but becomes scarce 
to the north of the Tyne, though it may be noticed in 
the neighbouriiood of Rothbury and Roathley, in Nor- 
thumberland.
The Hensbane is common about all our 
villages, especially near the sea coast; but the Deadly 
Night Shade (Atropa Bella-Donna) is fortunately very 
rare.
The plants, which seem designed by nature to bind 
die loose sands of the sea shore in the north of Europe 
by their creeping roots, or rather stolones, are the means 
of forming low round-toiq)ed hills called Links, along a 
considerable part of these coasts.
'Diose whose locali- 
ties are confined to the beaeh are the Sea Whea4; Grass 
(Triticum junceum), Sea Mat Grass ( Arundo arenaria), 
Sand Lime Grass (Elymus arenarius), Sea-green Fescue 
Grass (Festuca glauca), Sand Sedge (Carex arenaria), 
and occasionally Sea Eryngo (Eryngium maritimum), 
and Sea Rush (Juncus maritimps)!
but to them may be 
added the following auxiliaries^ whiich are by no means 
exclusively the productions of the sea shore â€” the Couch 
Grass (Triticum repens), thp Ladies' Bed Straw (Galium 
verum), the Rest Harrow (Ononis repens), the Bumet-r 
leaved or Scotch Rose (Rosa spinosissima), with some 
Compositse apd a few other plants.
The Sea Buckthorn 
(Hippophae rhamnoides) is unknown here, nor ai*e the 
upright Cocksfoot Grass (Dactylis striata), Creeping 
Panic Grass (Panicum Dactylon), or Great Sharp Sea 
Rush (Juncns acutus), all of which occasionally occur on 
fhe southern coast of England, and abound on the shores 
so 
of the Slediterraoean^ to be met with; and the rare 
Northern Sedge (Carex incurva) is also a stranger.
Of the domestic plants, or such as fc^ow the footsteps 
of man, and thrive amidst dust and rubbidi, we have 
such as are common to the rest of Britain.
The 
Wormwood, Mallow, Mugwort, Hemlock, Docks, &c.
&c.
are to be found wherever a few m]send)le hovels are 
built, and the Plantain (Plantago major) by every foot- 
path.
Ramond and De CandoUe observed several of 
these species among the ruins of cottages where shep- 
herds had once lived, high on the Pyrenees ; and some 
years since I remarked the same circumstance in the 
Highlands of Scotland.
The constant appearance of 
these weeds about towns and villages is a curious and 
inexplicable phenomenon, for no one- ever cultivated 
such plants for utility, much less for ornament.* And 
here it may not be amiss to notice some flowers which 
* The apfMsaraiice of domestic plants, as thriving about the poorest 
habitations, struck me in my passage over the Col du Bon Homme, 
a mountain in Savoy, whose extreme height is 8,376 feet above the 
sea.
Having descended about half the way from the summit, called 
La Croix du Bon Homme, 7>^30 feet, to the viOage of Chapiu, 4,668 
feet, I passed a few old wooden sheds which had been erected for cows, 
about these I saw several common plante, docks, &c., and among 
which was the Alpine Dock (Rumex alpinus).
I also remarked the 
occurrence of the some species in the small and wretched villages 
of Chapiu and of the Glacier ; likewise at the Chalet of Motet, situ- 
ated on the Col de la Seigne, a mountain 7>d78 feet abgve the sur<Â« 
face of the sea in height.
In addition to these common species.
Cineraria cordifolia, called Groldkraut by die Bemois, grows about 
the chalets on all the alps.-^-Jokn Hogg^ Esq*t MSS,

are now indigenous, and have been admitted to a place 
in the Flora Britannica by Sir E.
Smith, but which at 
no very distant period have escaped from the garden.
We have three remarkable species standing in this pre- 
dicament â€” the Summer Snow Flake, the single yellow 
Tulip, and the drooping Star of Bethlem ; besides the 
Snowdrop, Daffodil, Bitter Candytuft, Cdadine, Willow 
leaved Spiraea,* and Scentless Dame's Violet, are sel- 
dom found far from some habitation.
On the other 
hand, the Columbine is truly a native of our woods, 
and the borders of the Cumberland Lakes; and the 
Rosebay Willow herb, (which being overlooked in the 
time of Ray, has had its riglit to a place among British 
species disputed) is found on our most inaccessible rocks, 
and among the recesses of the Cheviots, in Teesdale, and 
at Shewing Shields.
The Fuller's Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), and Woad 
(Isatis tinctoria) appear to have been introduced by the 
means of cultivation ; though if it could be ascertained that 
a preparation of the latter was really the substance used 
by the Britons to stain themselves blue, the Woad 
would have a good right to be considered indigenous.
The Hop occurs in hedges, but never in natural woods, 
and probably was originally a stranger.
As the temperature of the waters varies much less 
than that of the atmosphere, aquatic plants are more 
universally spread over the surface of the globe than 
any other description of plants.

we have, 62 are common to the rest erf* this island ; and 
the three individuals, Alisma natans, Isoetes lacustris, and 
Lobelia Dortmanna, which may be considered rare, 
are natives of the colder waters of the Cumberland 
Lakes.
The vegetables, which are to be met with every where 
in our plains, we have in common with the North of 
France, Switzerland, and Germany, and even in Nor- 
way the pasture grasses are like our own; and our 
Alpine productions agree in a great measure with 
those of the mountains of Switzerland, Piedpiont, Sa-r 
voy, and Lapland : but the following enumeration will 
place this similarity in a clear point of view.

This plant differs in no- 
tlung, e^Lcept being smaller in size, from Nuphar lutea, the flower 
scarcely measuring an inch across, when expanded, for the specific 
marics of the stigma being toothed or entire, is fallaceous, and depends 
upon the age of the seed-vessels of these plants.
But it may be 
worthy of notice that Nuphar minima was transplanted fifteen years 
since by John Trevelyan, Esq. into his fiah ponds at WaIlingtonÂ» 
where it grows with Nuphar lutea, and still retains its diminutive 
size.

By the foregoing data it will appear that this small 
portion of England possesses a copious and highly diver- 
sified Flora.
The variety of exposure and situation 
adapted to the growth of different plants, arising from 
the height of the mountains and extent of level ground 
at their base, its shady and damp woods, dow streams, 
deep and cold lakes, besides the extent of sea coast, in 
some measure counteracting our distance from the equa- 
tor, by which the number of species belonging to both 
the vegetable and animal kingdoms are regulated.
Ano- 
ther cause of the diversity of our vegetable productions, 
I conceive to be the variety of soils, owing to thejdecom- 
position of the several formations of rocky strata, for 
notwithstanding the high authority of De CandoUe, I 
cannot help thinking that the chemical character of soils 
has a direct, as well as an indirect influence, on the re- 
production and health of many plants- 
The whole number of vegetables detected in Great 
Britain and Ireland, scarcely exceeds 5,00^ of which 
two-thirds are to be found in the three northern coun- 
ties.
The plants' of frequent occurrence in the southern 
and western parts of the kingdom which do not occur in 
thifi diistrkty are the i^eadiog and neltle*leayed Bdl^ 
flower (Campanula patula and Campanula TracheliinÂ»)Â» 
S9 
tlie pale smooth-leaved Willow-herb (Epilobum ro- 
â€¢eum*), die Navel Wort (Cotykdon Umbelliais), the 
Travdler'fi Joy (Clematis Vitalba), several species of 
Verbaseam, some Mints, the lesser Broom-rape (Oro- 
baache minor), which is a destructive weed in Surrey 
and Sussex by attaching itself to the roots of Ae clo- 
vser, and the greater Dodder (Cuscuta europsea), en- 
twinuig Taniy, Nettles, &c.
To these may be added 
some few rare plants from the Pyrenees, wliich reach 
Cornwall and Devonshire; and others, like the Box, at- 
tached to the chalky soil of Surrey, Kent, Hampshire, 
and Sussex : but there is not a numerous genus in the 
island, of which we do not possess some species.
Though observations upon organic remains may ap^ 
pear out of place among minutes intended to illustrate the 
geography of plants, yet it may not be fimm to remade, 
that not one of the vegetables which have left impressions 
on our shale, sandstones, and coal, or on the alum shale, 
and sandstones of the Lias formation near Whitby, are 
known to exist at the present day.
The casts which fre- 
quently occur in this coal field are those of trunks of large 
trees, imbedded in sandstone and mineralized by silex, 
and their bark changed into coal, but to what species they 
belonged it is impossible even to conjecture, as no im- 
pressions of leaves remain ; also short thick stems resem- 
bling those of the genus Euphorbia with scaly bark, 
some with broad spear-shaped leaves, and others with 
narrow recurved sedge-like leaves.

shaped blossoms pressed close to their stems, pear-

stone nodules.
When erect, the Trees, Euphorbise and 
Reeds retain their proper shapes, but are always com- 
pressed when found in a horizontal position.
Note, â€” The coal shale of New South Wales contains impressions 
of the leaves of a phaenogamous plant resembling some species of 
Eucalyptus.
