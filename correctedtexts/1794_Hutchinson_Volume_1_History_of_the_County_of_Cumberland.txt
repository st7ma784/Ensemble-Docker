INTRODUCTION.
T HE General Hijlory of this county necefiarily ought to engage the reader's 
attention, before he enters upon a defcriptive view of each place, and the 
particular hifiorical incidents relative thereto.
From the Roman hifiorians, very little light is thrown upon the ancient Rate of 
this part of Britain.
It was not, till the time of Agricola, that the Northumbrians 
fubmilted to the Roman arms, in the eightieth year of the Chrifiian cera.
The 
Brigantes, according to Roman writers, poffefled a very large trad of country on 
the wefiern coafi of Britian ; but as our attention in this work is confined to a 
narrow boundary, it is enough for us to obferve, they inhabited the difirid now 
called Cumberland: they are defcribed to be a fierce and warlike people ; reftlefs 
in their dilpofition, and i neon Rant in obligations to Grangers ; inured to hard- 
fhips, indefatigable in their adventures, valiant in arms, of a nice honour to- 
wards their own nation, and faithful to each other, even under all the wretchednefs 
of defpair.
It is conceived they had the name of Brigantes from the mountainous 
country they inhabited, and the Tartar-like bands in which they marauded.
Strabo 
fpeaks of the Brigantes of the Alps, and calls them graj/a tores, robbers , and plunder- 
ers : if we admit of this definition, the appellation, moft probably, was derived 
from the Romans, as a mark of their hatred and contempt ,â€¢ and we (hall yet remain 
uninformed of the true Britifh name of the inhabitants.
The accounts given by the Romans, are, of themfelves, confufed and contra- 
â– diftory ; and we have no pofitive proof of their having traverfed the mountains, 
the Britilh Appenines, and having palled to this vvefiern region, at the time that 
the fubmiflion of the Northumbrians is recorded.
The extenfive territory of the 
Brigantes, occafions the hidory of that people, as received from the Roman writers, 
to be fo full of inconliftencies, that it is not poflible for us, with any degree of 
certainty, to place the events, recorded by them, in this particular diftridt.
The 
infamous Rory of Cartifmandua does not claim its locality with us ; her treachery 
to Caradlacus , the fovereign of many Rates, of which Brigantia was one that fhc 
ruled over as a tributary, is eReemed fabulous; though it is delivered us by 
Tacitus.
It is not pertinent to our prefent work to enter into difquiRtions and 
criricifms on this dark part of hiRory; attention to that circumRance, indeed, is 
fo far confident, as, infome degree, it difeovers to us the manners of the age, and 
the difpofitions of the natives of the northern parts of Britain.
In thofe days, it 
was no difgrace, to the bravefi people, to be governed by a woman difgufifuL 
effeminacies had not then contaminated the fex; the fripperies and infignificancies 
of the female accomplifhment were referved to a very diRant age: even men inured 
to indefatigable labours and toils, conRantly in arms, fubfiRing chiefly by warfare 
or the chace, and bred up to feats of valour and the Ample rules of native honour, 
were not afhamed to be led to battle by a woman; and to receive the maxims of 
vol.

INTRODUCTION.
their interior police, from the dilates of female judgment : nor is the hif- 
tory of Cartifmand.ua blotted, till, by the intercourfe of the Romans, the native 
virtue of the Brigantes was corrupted.
In Stewart's difcourfe prefixed to the 
fecond edition of Sullivan's, Leftures> it is faid â€œ The Britons were debauched into 
a refemblance with a moft corrupted people.
They renounced the fatigues of war 
<( for the blandifhments of peace.
They forfook their huts for palaces ; affedcd 
â€¢< a ccftlinefs of living, and gave way to a feducing voluptuoufnefs." Thofe 
foreigners introduced enjoyments of life, of which the Britons had not hereto- 
fore formed an idea; their wealth taught corruption, and their luxuries vice.
The 
diflipation derived from two fuch dreadful channels, foon overthrew the empire 
of this queen; fhe liftened to the infiduous whifpers of an infamous luft; fhe ex- 
pelled her hulband, and took to her bed his armour-bearer.
To the Roman 
manners we muff attribute this moft flagrant breach of conjugal duty: it was no 
new thing with the invaders; but among Britons, before the Roman acceflion, we do 
not hear of one inftance.
The Roman writers* prefumed to impute to the natives 
the groffeft ftate of incontinence; a view of the Britifh habitations might pro- 
mote, in the minds of ftrangers, an erroneous conception of the manners of the 
people; that the women held a common intercourfe with a whole family: one 
fmall hut was their general dormitory; whilft their occupations were in the fields 
in the day time ; befides, fuch a criminal ftate of life as is imputed to them, was 
not confident with the general tenor of the polity of the Druid adminiftration, the 
tenets of which were deduced from moral obligation: and what utterly controverts 
the pofition is, that if incontinence, inceft, and infidelity in the marriage contrad, 
were the habitual vices of Britifh life, the error of Lartifmandua would never have 
involved a whole nation in civil war, and engaged the Roman arms, when there 
was nothing but a familiar fad to provoke, which cuftom would have rendered 
inoffenfive.
The Brigantes were divided: one party attached themfelves to 
Venulius , the injured hulband, the other to the queen, to whom they owed an old 
affedion for the virtues of mind which fhe had difplayed before fhe was infeded 
With Roman manners.
The divided country was wafted with inteftine broils, and 
though it did not inftantly fall under the Roman fword, it funk into fuch imbe- 
cility, as afterwards rendered it eafy of conqueft.
There were ftill remaining of this people, many who would not fubmit to the 
Roman yoke ; and we are told they were driven northward ; Hadrian aflumed the 
imperial purple in the year 117 ; in his time, to fecure the Roman province from 
being inceffantly haraffed by a banditti, who defcended the northern mountains 
like wolves, and marked their paflage with deftrudion, the Romans, about the 
year 121, drew from fea to fea the Puetentura of earth, with its ditches, in the 
progrefs of this work particularly traced and defcribed.
From this sera we may 
date the complete fubmiflion of the territory of the Brigantes , which lay fouth of 
Solway Frith: for it would be inconfiftent to conceive, that within this line, any 
people were included, who had not fubmitted themfelves to the Roman government, 
and given due teftimonies of their fidelity and attachment to the new rulers.
* Csefar and Tacitus.
The 
INTRODUCTION.
*y 
The Brigantes fettled north of the Preetentura of Hadrian , affirmed the name of 
M<eat<e : and being ever contentious and difcordant, and retaining an inveterate 
hatred to the Romans, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, raifed fuch dangerous 
commotions, that Lollius Urbicus, his legate, was obliged to advance agairift them 
with great power, and, after many conflicts, fubdued them.
In Ridpathâ€™s Border Hiflory , we have the following account of the Maata fo ju- 
dicioufly drawn up, as to merit particular notice.
â€œ Phe Msata* appear to have 
â€œ inhabited the lower lands of Scotland, while the mountainous parts were poflefTed 
" by the Caledonians ; but it is doubted whether thefe M<eal<e were the inhabitants 
â€œ of the fouth of Scotland, or of the lower tra&s of country to the north of Edin- 
burgh Frith ; although the former opinion feems more probable.
The ancient 
â€œ hiftorians defcribe the Caledonians and Meeata as entirely refembling each other, 
â€œ in their manners and cuftoms, both in war and peace.
Their arms were the 
Â«* fame as thofe ufed by their anceflors in the time of Agricola.
For offence they 
â€œ were provided with a fhort fpear, a broad fword, a dirk, and javelins ; for de- 
â€œ fence they had nothing but a fmall target.
They lived in tents, f having no 
â€œ houfes, towns, or villages: hence their food was chiefly the milk and flefhof their 
f â€˜ cattle, and the game they took in hunting, together with the roots and fruits 
that the foil naturally yielded.
They are faid to have had fome fort of food, 
â€œ or rather medicine, a quantity of which, no bigger than a bean, prevented all 
â€œ fenfe of hunger and third; and this they made ufe of in their long marches.
" They abflained totally from fifh, though their feas and rivers produced it in 
** great plenty.
Inftead of drefs, they painted their bodies, which were moflly 
u naked.
Property was very little regarded by them.
They were fwift and fure 
â€œ of foot; patient of toil, hunger, third, and other hardfhips.
They had horfes, 
â€œ fmall but fleet, and retained their ancient cudom of fighting in chariots.
In 
â€œ almod all thefe particulars, and alfo in their language, they refembled the 
'* Brigantes, zvitb whom they appear to have been originally the fame people .â€ 
The peace obtained by Urbicus was of fliort duration; and, after fucceflive in- 
* Their name is derived from the Britifh word Meath, a place.
Dio fays they had no towns ; but it 
is evident, from Ptolomyâ€™s Geography, that there were fome towns at that time in the fouth of Scotland 
Dio alfo mentions Severusâ€™s returning after he had made peace with the Caledonians, into the country of 
friends or allies, (o; Qihw) which Carte interprets of the country between Hadrianâ€™s wall and the 
Friths, which, though not reduced into the form of a province, was inhabited by people that were de- 
pendants and allies of the Romans, (but why not <p<A<c4 denote the Roman province itfelf) but that 
the inhabitants of this country were the Mseatx of Dio, is inferred from this faying.
That, at the time of 
Severusâ€™s expedition, â€œ there were two nations of the Britons that remained unconquered, the Caledonians 
and the Maeatae, whereof the latter dwelt next the wall that divides the ifland into two parts, and that 
the Caledonians were beyond thefe.â€ Now, according to Tacitus, the country of the Caledonians began 
from Antoninusâ€™s rampart ; and therefore the Maeatae muft have lain between the walls of Hadrian and 
Antoninus.
That the polfeflion the Romans had of the country between thefe walls was very fhort and 
uncertain, and that Hadrianâ€™s rampart, or Severusâ€™s wall, was the mod ufual boundary of the Roman 
province, is inferred from various inferiptions, found in the ftations upon that wall, or near it, relating to 
both the former and latter emperors, whilft there was no fuch evidences of lafting Roman fettlements in 
the country adjacent to the rampart of Antoninus.

INTRODUCTION.
lurredtions and depredations committed upon the Roman province, it was not till 
the reign of Severus , who went againft thofe ferocious bands in perfon, that they 
fubmitted to the Roman power, withdrew themfelves from the frontiers, gave up 
a large trad: of their country by way of barrier, north of the fortifications ereded 
by Hadrian , and bound themfelves in a folemn marmer, not to violate their truce.
Then it was, that Severus caufed the fecond Pratentura to be formed, from Solway 
Frith to the mouth of Tyne, built with ftone, ftrengthened by an outw'ard ditch, 
and guarded by towers, and a chain of forts or fiations ; to the remains of w hich, 
the ffricteff attention will be paid in the courfe of this wrnrk.
We have been more particularly attentive to the Roman affairs imthis county* 
than in the View of Northumberland.

natural face of the country, that here the chief incurfions were pradifed againft 
the Romans.
Scotland flretches out to the weff and northweft from Solway Frith ; 
the lands adjacent to the Pratentura , on account of their mountains and moraffes, 
and from the many forefts that then covered the face of the country, were moft 
capable of concealing and maintaining the tribes of rovers, W'ho conftantly were 
attempting to make defeents upon the Roman province, and commit depredations 
on the allies.
Northumberland , from the foot of Cheviots , is more level and 
open, lefs adapted to fuch purpofes, and lefs fubjed to furprife.
Fhe forejl of 
'Jedburgh long continued a refort for the tumultuous inhabitants of the northern 
regions, who affembled to make war upon their fouthern neighbours.
The paf- 
fage from Fiviotdale into the heights of Northumberland was dangerous and 
difficult, and fo barren and thinly Rocked, that an army could not Tublift ; which 
reafons lead us to conclude, that the chief incurfions were made within the diftrid 
of Cumberland.
Before we advance to a more extended period of the Roman poffeffion in this 
part of the ifland, it may not be unprofitable to take a flight view of the religious 
infitutions and the police of the natives, fo far as the obfeurity in which they are 
â€¢involved, will permit.
We do not find that the Britons, from the firft accounts of them, in this part 
of the ifland, were enveloped in that dreadful darknefs of mind, in which moft 
other nations, on their firft difeovery by Europeans, have been deferibed to us: on 
the contrary, they were not ignorant of the Deity, and had not corrupted their 
theology unth idolatry.
They feem rather to have been wonderfully enlightened ; 
and probably they derived this bleffing from an intercourfe w ith the Pboenicians t 
improved by maxims brought with the firft fettlers from Germany , having their 
Druids and Bards.
In times of unlettered ignorance, it is no wonder the priefts 
had great influence over the multitude, efpecially the Druid , w ho was at once 
preceptor, lawgiver, divine, phyfician, and judge.
This order of men poflefled all 
the learning of the age ; it is believed they knew the Greek alphabet, and ufed 
that character in their numerations, as well touching ftate affairs, as obfervations 
in aftronomy and natural philofophy: but their ffudy of divinity was arduous, no 
character or writing being permitted therein : nor was writing admitted, even in 
the ethic fchool.
It 
INTRODUCTION.
It is an argument, yet unfolved by the learned, whether that kind of religious 
influence was not a blefling, rather than a prejudice to the people.
In this 
polite age, w'e have diffolved thofe prevalences, and have fhaken off all holy vene- 
ration for the priedhood and their doctrines, under the detefiable appellations of 
cnthufiafm, bigotry, and fuperftition ; we have refined our religion into levity, we 
have brought the fervants of God into contempt ; the houfe of prayer is deferred ; 
and the Deity almoft forgotten.
It reminds us of JVero, who grew fo familiar 
with the divinity he worfhipped, that at length, it is faid by the hifiorian, he 
' defiled it, in a manner too indelicate to be deferibed here.
Modern levity, touch- 
ing things divine, has almoft reduced them to the like contempt.
The vulgar, 
when not kept in awe, are infolent ; and when at liberty, are licentious.
When 
we look back upon the volume of human life, and refled: that the know ledge of 
mankind was progrefiive, and that innumerable ages had elapfed to bring them 
to the effate of civilization in which they now are, we muff conceive a molt 
melancholy idea of the firft race of men.
From the hiftory of ancient dates, we 
are led to determine, that innovations in religion and contempt of facred things 
marked the advancing diffolution of each empire; difobedience to government 
fucceeded ; the bonds of public faith were thenceforth loofened; the compad 
between citizen and citizen was fo far diffolved, that corruption prevailed againft 
private virtue; and vice, like the fecret progrefs of poifon, dole into the vital 
parts of the date, and gradually brought on dedrudion : when luxury had diffufed 
its corruption to the root of manners ; when crimes from familiarity were deprived 
of the ding which confcience prepared; when religion, the trier of truth and rec- 
titude, was no longer the arbiter of the foul, each fatal event rapidly enfued.
Men 
who had few natural virtues were deterred from open vices, by the cenfures of 
the church, more than the penal law ; and thofe who were blefled with good 
talents, were exhilerated by the profped of great temporal rewards, as well as the 
fpiritual conlolations of an enlivened faith.
But to return to the Druid : â€” he taught the adoration of the divine effence, and 
deduced his arguments from examples difplayed in the book of nature.
He 
chole the loftied groves and mod folemn fcencs, for the convocation of his people; 
he performed the facred rites with the greated magnificence and awful pomp ; 
and all the exercife of his religion, was with that folemnity of ceremony, that 
deeply affedled the fpectator; nay, in fo powerful a degree did they maintain this, 
that, it is laid, even the detedinglRomans â€œflood aflonijhed , and trembled .â€ They 
indituted religious fedivals, and fandlified the victims by facrifice.
In all public 
allemblies for adminidring judice, orconfulting on national or provincial matters, 
the duty of the day was preceded by an awfuL facrifice ; the victims for which 
were fometimes criminals condemned for atrocious crimes; who then differed 
public execution : What could make a dronger imprefllon on the fpe&ator, or be 
devifed to drike the human mind with greater terror, againd committing the like 
offences !
It was not fimilar to our modern executions ; merely the lopping off of 
life ; but a tremendous mode of remitting to an offended Deity a reprobate and 
incorrigible fpirit, to differ the judgment of heaven.
This county, it is appre- 
hended.
$ 
INTRODUCTION.
hended, was poflefled by fome of the chief Druids ; many of their monuments Hill 
remaining, and one the moff noble and extenfive of any in the ifland ; as will 
appear, when compared with Rollrich and others.
Stonehenge , we conceive, is 
not of the like nature, the work of the fame people, or for the lame appropriation ; 
the Hones there being wrought with a tool ; â€” a defilement prohibited by the an- 
cient Hebrews, and never infianced in the druidical remains.
The land was divided into feveral fmall Hates, governed by their refpedive 
potentates, whofe authority was little more, than that of being leaders in war: for 
in the deeper maxims of Hate, the Druids were fupreme ; and even in the bufinefs 
of the field, the people had that power over their prince, that he muH necefiarily 
yield to their councils : this leems clearly derived from the Gaulijh polity.
The 
people, from every evidence which the obfeure age has furnilhed, appear to 
have been entirely free, throughout all ranks of men ; and no original traces of 
villeinage are to be difeovered in thofe remote times.
It has been matter of 
difpute with the learned, from whence this abjed Hate of men was derived.
Whilfl Germany had not yet fent out her colonies, from whence, we prefume, the 
coafls of Britain were occafionally fettled, it is pretty certain no fuch order of 
men exiHed there ; the Servi fpoken of by Ccefar and Tacitus, being foccage men, 
though not in that perfect privilege which foccage tenants afterwards gained.
It is 
mofl confiflent, to prefume they were captives in war; the Roman Haves being 
fuch.
Lord Coke, who fupports his opinion on Bratton Fleta and the Mirror , fays, 
â€œ The condition of villeins , who pafled from freedom into bondage, in ancient time, 
Â« grew by the conflitution of nations, and not by law of nature; in which time all 
Â« things were common to all; and by multiplication of people, and making proper 
â€œ and private, thofe things that were common, arofe battles.
And then it was 
Â« ordained by conHitution of nations (he means by the tacit confent of civilized 
Â« nations) that none fliould kill another, but that he that was taken in battle 
Â« fliould remain bond to his taker for ever, and he to do with him, and all that 
Â«* fliould come of him, his will and pleafure, as with his beafl, or any other cattle, 
" to give or to fell, or to kill : and after, it was ordained, for the cruelty of fome 
Â« r lords, that none fliould kill them, and that the life and members of them, as 
Â«< well as of freemen, were in the hands and protedion of kings ; and that he that 
Â« killed his villein fliould have the fame judgment as if he had killed a freeman.â€ 
This flridly correfponds with the account the Roman civil law gives of the rife of 
vaflalage.
Our lawmen have not agreed what people firfl introduced villeinage 
among the Britons ; it is mofl probable it was the confequence of the Roman 
conquefl, and was afterwards maintained by the Saxons and Danes: but as it is 
evident villienage had not gained an eflablifliment in this country, at the period 
we have fixed on for our digrefiion, we will leave the fubjed for the prefent.
Whether the Britifli fovereigns had any public revenue, we have not difeovered ; 
or whether they had any fubfiflence granted from the flocks and herds of their 
fubjeds, to fupport their dignity.
It is probable each potentate was maintained 
by the produce of his own efiate; and that he had no other reward for his 
public duties, than the joy of ferving his people, and the acquifition of popular

love and public fame.
The exigences of Rate were fupplied by a public tax on 
the fubje<5ts in general, the Druids only being exempt.
It was a powerful device of the Druids , in order to keep the legiflative power in 
their hands, to declare to the people, that laws were the ordinances of heaven, and that, 
with other religious matters, they folely appertained to the minifters of the Deity.
The 
MoJ'aic ordonances feem to have di&ated this fyftem.
It is probable the Britifh 
priefts had a perfect code of laws ; but as they were not permitted to be reduced 
into writing, but were taught orally, as a icience to their own tribe only, they 
expired with the extinction of that people.
The habitations of the Britons were rude and incommodious, being little more 
than a hovel ; from the huts in the north of Scotland, it feems probable they were 
round, fupported againfl a tree in the centre, and roofed by boughs placed in an 
inclining order, covered with turf, where a whole family lodged.
They crowded 
thofe erections together without attending to order, convenience, or regularity, 
round the hut of their leader : and as they were conftantly in a warfaring Bate, thofe 
collected huts were embowered in the thickeft forefts, defended by an outward 
ditch, and a vallum of loofe pebbles, piled up to a vaft magnitude; and frequently 
the whole fettlement was barracadoed by timber trees, felled and throurn together 
in the rudeft, but moft intricate form.
The veftige of one of thofe walled towns 
remains in the county of Durham, the only one we ever faw; of a fquare form, 
the plain inclining to the fouth-weft, defended by an outward ditch, and a vallum 
of incredible magnitude, compofed of loofe pebbles, piled up to fuch a ridge, that 
the interior huts have been effectually covered and concealed by it.
Strutt in his 
Chi or.icle of England ,t fays, â€œ Their ftrongeft places were only furrounded by a ditch 
*â€¢ and vallum of earth ; and the entrances blocked up with trees, cut down and laid 
â€œ acrofs them,* or, inftead of the vallum, a rude wall of great loofe Bones, without 
â€œ mortar or cement.â€^ They knew not even the common conveniences of the 
houfehold, they entered the hovel, laid down to reft, waked and departed to their 
feveral avocations in the field.
It is certain, they knew' nothing of tillage in thefe 
northern diftricls; they had a few herds and flocks, and in fummer fubfifted chiefly 
by the chace.
Their art of tew conflfted of few manoeuvres: â€” ftrength, fortitude, intrepidity, 
and an infatiable paflion for achievmcnts and the love of glory, were the chief 
accomplifhments of a foldier.
They fought in tribes, each commanded by its 
proper chieftain, fo that what was wanted in art, was amply recompenfed by fide- 
lity, and the ftrongeft attachments.
They engaged on foot, on horfeback, and in 
chariots.
The infantry conftituted the chief part of the Britifh army, Â§ whilft the fouthern 
foldiers were clothed in the manner of the Belgic Gauls, with a coarfe woollen 
tunic, over which v/as caft a cloak, reaching below the w r aift, || their legs and

animals, bound round the waift with a girdle; they were lightly armed, carrying 
a fpear, and a fwordof brafs or iron, and a light target on the left arm ; the more 
northern people fought almoft naked, having the fkin of fome wild bead: cad: 
loofely round the waift, or lufpended from the fhoulder; and, to render themfelves 
hideous, they ftained their faces, breads, and parts expofed, with various dyes ; 
they bore a target and a fvvord fufpended by chains of iron; and were very dex- 
terous in the management of fhort fpcars, which w^ere pointed with brafs, and had 
a pendulous bell of the like metal adjoining to the fockct; which, being fhook as 
they advanced, gave a harfh and difmal clangour, whereby the horfes of an enemy 
were frighted and thrown into difordcr.
They w'ere fwift of foot, and made fudben 
attacks, wheeling and retreating in fuch a manner, as greatly to harrafs heavy 
armed troops.
The cavalry confided of very fmall horfes, but being trained to fudden evolu- 
tions, were of infinite fervice ; the horfemen were armed for fighting on foot ; and 
frequently, after harafting the flanks of an army, difmounted, and lupported the 
infantry; â€” inftantaneous, as the occafion offered, they remounted, fell upon the 
difordered troops where an enemyâ€™s line wâ€™as broken, and charged in flank, or in 
rear ; changing their manoeuvres with the utmoff alacrity and (kill.
The zvar chariots were of three forts: the Covinus w'as armed with hooks, t and 
contained only the charioteer; all its execution depending on the force and ra- 
pidity with which thofe hooks were driven through the enemyâ€™s array.
The 
Rheda and Ejfedum are fuppofed not to have been armed w ith hooks, and had their 
diftindtion folely from the number of light armed troops they carried ; who, being 
difeiplined to great expertnefs in throwing the javelin, on pafting the enemy with 
the horfes at full fpeed, would make great (laughter.
Caefar deferibes this chariot 
fighting, and their method of charging, as being very formidable : the Britons 
retained great numbers of them in their armies, infomuch that when Caffivellaunus 
reduced his troops on a treaty of peace, he retained four thoufand chariots, as a 
ncceflary Handing force.
Their order of battle was generally with the chariots in 
front as the van; their centre was entirely formed of the beft armed infantry, and 
the flanks compofed of light troops and cavalry : their favourite difpofition w as on 
an inclining plain ; where the corps de referve, or back ranks, might be feen by the 
enemy, and prefent to them a more powerful fhew of forces.
They had no in-r 
ftruments of martial mufic, but the onfet was with hideous howlings and outcry, 
mixed with the clangour of beating their weapons on the fnield, and fhaking the 
bell-fpears.
We have no certain evidence w hether the Britons of this diftridt had any dif- 
tindt trade ; if we confider the merchandife they had, we may form fome probable 
conjectures, though w r e want politive evidence.
The firft commodities we read of 
were lead, tin , and the fkins of beafis, which the people fold to the Phoenicians, and 
afterwards to the Greeks, and received, in exchange, fait, earthen ware, and in- 
ftruments, or trinkets, made of brafs.

produce lead and /kins than the mountains and forefts of Cumberland.
Tin is 
mentioned by Homer, fo antient was that branch of trade with the Greeks.
The 
intercourfe with civilized nations, whofe luxuries had rendered neceflary other 
articles lound in Britain, foon extended their traffic, and we find the following 
things were in requeft alter the coming of the Romans : gold , J.
liver , iron, corn , 
cattle , /laves, dogs for the chacef various precious ftones , p' arls,% chalk , and lafkets of 
wicker, which were fo delicately made, as to be in very great eftimation at Rome.Â§ 
The Romans brought in return nothing but articles of luxury and magnificence.
Of the laft-mentioned articles of Brinfh traffic, many of them were produced in 
this country.
There were Jilvcr mines at Kefwick, as will be particularly obferved 
in thecourleof this work; indeed, fo foon as the art of refining lead took place, 
filver mud have become more abundant.
Iron has been wrought here, as the 
heaps of refufe, or flag, as the miners call it, found in many places, tefiify ; but after 
the forefts were deftroyed, the want of fuel put a ftop to that manufactory.
Cat- 
tle, it is to be conceived, abounded in the vallies; but no corn.
Slaves are men- 
tioned, and muft have been the unhappy captives of the northern nations, taken 
in war : for we read of no vaftalage in this sera.

marcafites are difcovered.
Pearls are found in the river Iret, which difcharges 
itfeif into the ocean a few miles north of Ravenglafs.
It is a very clear ftream, 
flowing on a pebbly channel ; the mufcles producing them are of the large horfe 
mufcle kind, found in many other rivers in the north of England.
Lime abounds 
in this county, and that fpecies commonly known by the name of gypfum, or 
alplafter , f which might be known to the Romans, and ufed in their elegant 
edifices.
Balkets, no doubt, were manufactured here, one fpecies of the Druid

but none of the inferiptions inferted, becaufe it may be fuppofed, they had fo often been already publifhed.

taken notice of in my fatherâ€™s commentary on Antoninusâ€™s Itinerary, A.

Then comes 
Mr. Keifler, who has been very copious, and given feveral draughts of them, but not having the book by 
ir.e, I cannot be particular.
Lalt of all comes a Benedidtine of the congregation cf St. Maur, and in his 
Religion du Gauloiftiree de plus rares fources de 1 â€™ Antiquite, printed at Paris, 1727, p.
78, he give3 
you a defeription of no lefs than feventeen of thefe monuments; without any infeription, except upon 
three, whofe figures he has engraved ; one of which, is that of the goddefs in her fhort cloak, dog at her 
right foot, at her left Dew upon the prow of a fliip, and underneath her, the letters Massom Sabvs Q^B.
â€” that which I received from you has Salus.
He tells you he will not fubjedt himfelf to explain any of 
the inferiptions, fince they give no light to the matter.
All thefe authors concur in making Nehalennia 
the new moon, and have attempted feveral derivations of the name, particularly the Benedidtine, who has 
tvv.'fled and turned it feveral ways, to make it fpeak his mind : but the fimplefl and mod probable, in my 
opinion, is that of Altingius, as being formed from the old German language NIE-HEL Novum Lumen 
Nr* ZiXr.rv very near the fame both in found and iignification.
The Negociator Cretarius Britannicianus was, as you obferve, a dealer in chalk, or fullerâ€™s earth, or 
marie ; but Britannicianus does not denote the country where he was born, for then he would have been 
called Britto, or Britanus, but the place to which he traded : he was a Britifh trader, as we fay at this 
day, a Hollandâ€™s trader, for any of our iflanders that trade to Holland.
You have, however, the Brittan- 
niciani, as well as the Britanes mentioned in the Notit: Imperii ; a word, perhaps, crept into the lan- 
guage of the Lower Empire, and formed from Bi itanastie, the country word, being a near refemblance 
to it.
I muft confefs the flatue eredted to Nehalennia, by M.
Tarinus Prinius, is not taken notice of by any 
of thefe authors, no more than that of Januarius Ambadthius ; fo thefe are likely to be new, as well as

The latter of thefe has fliewn, in a fecond work of his, that the fhort cloak of Nehalennia was the 
ufual wear of the Gaulifn women, and not the Gaulifh fagum, in oppofition to one Deflaudes, who fays

By 
the following difcovery, it appears that their boats were of a much fuperior con- 
ftrudtion to thofe mentioned by hiftorians.
In a letter from Sir John Clerk to Roger Gale, Efq. dated Edinburgh, nth 
June, 1727, among the manufcripts of that learned antiquarian, are the following 
particulars.
â€œ I {hall acquaint you with a very ancient curiofity, found about 
â€œ eighteen miles from this place.
The wafh of the river Caron difcovered a 
u boat, thirteen or fourteen feet under ground ; it is thirty- fix feet in length, and 
* f four and a half in breadth, all of one piece of oak; there were feveral ftrata 
â€œ about it, fuch as loam, clay, fhells, mofs, fand, and gravel ; thefe flrata demonftrate 
â€œ it to have been an antediluvian boat.
|| The tree of which it was made, was, no 
â€œ doubt, very big, but ftill no bigger than one which is yet alive not far from that 
â€œ place ; it is about twelve or thirteen feet in diameter, and we have a pretty good 
â€œ document from an old author, who wrote the life of Sir William Wallace, a Scotch

At what period the Britons improved their art of navigation, and enlarged their

very eredl, and their Herns raifed to refill a fiorm : they were conttru&ed of oak, 
the feats of their rowers were beams a foot broad, and fattened with iron pins an 
inch thick: the anchors had chains of iron inftead of cables, and the fails were 
made of hides, or tanned leather.
They were fubllantial vefiels to bear the (hock 
of the iron beaks of the Roman galiies; but miferable things for navigation.
The Romans introduced many improvements in maritime affairs; Claudius gave 
great encouragement to fhip-building, % his veffels were of fuch dimenfions as 
would carry three hundred and twelve quarters of corn â€¢.
but how they were rigged 
is not mentioned.
About the year 359, no lefs than 800 fhips were employed by 
the Britons in exporting corn to Gaul.
The Romans alfo had a great naval force 
to protect the trade, commanded by a chief officer, whofe dittincffion w r as Lord High 
Admiral of the Britifb Seas.

and Aleftusy 293, the naval force w as renow ned : fo rapidly did thofe improve-

Various defcriptions have been given of the apparel of the Britons, which was 
not uniform through the ifland, but adopted, perhaps, from the different nations 
wdth w hich they had intercourfe.
Some wore long black garments, bound round 
the waift with a girdle; others a fhort mantle, plaited on one fhoulder and fattened 
with a pin, a fibula, or clafp: and again, the more barbarous were covered with 
fkins of deer, wolves, and other beafts of chace.
Their manufadlory of woollen was 
rude, being wool unfpun, beat, and driven together with much labour.

â€œ yellow colour, and hung down to the bottom of her waift ; on her neck fhe wore 
â€œ a maffy chain of gold : file was habited in a tunic of various colours, over which 
,f was a robe of coarfer woollen, bound round her with a girdle, fattened with 
buckles.â€ The chief ornaments of the northern Britons, were chains for their 
necks, maffy bracelets for the arms, and rings for the fingers; and where gold was 
not to be obtained, they ufed them of brafs and iron.
Among Mr. Galeâ€™s manuferipts is a letter from Mr. Maurice Jolonfon , which

â€œ this a ring, very thick, and much too little for any womanâ€™s finger was dug up, as 
** Captain Pownel allured me, (from whom I had them) made of flint vitrified, 
â€œ and ftained yellow with the juice of fome berry, as it feems, being of a pale 
u lemon colour.
Thefe rings, they fay, were in like manner the ornaments of the 
â€œ Britifh ladies, before the Romans taught them to drefs.â€ There is the following- 
note by Mr. Gale.
â€œ Thefe inftruments of flint have been found all over Europe, 
tf as well as in the Eaft and Well Indies; fo that the ufe of them feems to have 
fc been univerfal in old times: by their (kill in arts, fciencesand arms, our Britifh 
<f anceflry, and their ladies, feem to have been, at the Roman invafion, arrived to 
â€œ much the fame degree of learning, knowledge, and poiitenefs, as the lavages in 
â€œ the Weft Indies, when difcovered by Columbus.â€ 
Their diet was Ample ; filh, hares, hens, and geefe, they had an averfion to; they 
drefled their viands by boiling or roafting, and drank of liquor made of honey 
and barley.
They burnt the bodies of the dead ; the allies of fome were depofited 
under hillocks of earth, others in Hone chefts, compofed of five flat ftones, and 
covered with a pile of earth.
Thefe are the general lines of our northern Britons 
near the period before related to.
The Romans, with innumerable artifices, endeavoured to infinuate their maxims 
into the lives and manners of the natives : they fludied topromotethe adoption of their 
habits , cuftomSy luxuries , and pleafmes.
It was fome time before the people could be 
brought to tafle the enjoyment of thofe fafcinating exotics, and partake of the infinu- 
ating vices of the conquerors: their enormities towards thefairfex feem to have been 
the moll: offenlive and difguflful ; for when the Romans treated the daughters of Bo- 
adicia with lhameful indignities, the people were irritated to a formidable infurrec- 
tion ; which coft the aggreflors much time and bloodfhed to fupprefs and appeafe.
At length we find the Britons incorporated with the Romans : by their abode 
in this illand four hundred years, they became fo much reconciled and united, as 
to intermarry; the diftineftion of nations was loft, they became one people, and of 
one religion ; like the Romans, they built temples to the gods, ere<fted palaces, were 
frequent at the baths > and places of public diverfion, and at length adopted every 
art and fcience the Remans had brought with them.
Converfion in religion is not 
fo remarkable, if we conlider the Druid tribe was extirpated ; and the minds of 
the people w ere conciliated, by the Romans adopting the worlhip of the Deity the 
Britons had been taught to adore, under the names or diftinctions of Bel t Bat, 
Magon , &c.
of which many inftances are found in inferiptions to topical divinities; 
and this in particular, in thofe parts where the Druids formerly held their grant} 
conventions ; as fhall be particularly obferved in the courfe of this work; fo that 
it appears the ceremonies of worfliip, and not the objebl , underwent the change.
They became at length fo much one people, that, to fupport the Roman ambition, 
the Britifh youth having been incorporated with the legions, went forth with 
Maximus , a Spaniard by birth, and fubdued Gaul and Spain ; but extending his 
views too far, he loft all he had acquired, and facrificed his troops in a vain attempt 
to reduce Italy.
The fatal projcdl of Conftantine w'as a fucceeding blow, which 
Britain could never recover: her mteftine ftrength thus fapped, opened the channel 
for thofe depredations, which the northern nations afterwards carried, even into 
the 
INTRODUCTION: 
'5 
the fouthern provinces.
When the declining empire, rendered it neceflary to cal 
from Britain the Roman legions, our youth fired by ambition and the defire of 
military glory, were received among their troops; and all thofe, nearly connected 
with the departing people, joined in the emigration.
The difira&ed peafants, 
deferted by thofe in whom they had long trufied for fafety, w hen opprefied by 
the influx of an enemy from the northern mountains, were twice relieved by the 
coming of a Roman legion: the firfi repaired the wall or pratentura of Antoninus ; 
the fecond, the work ol Severus.
Even in the Roman empire, the arts had then 
declined very greatly ; and when the laft legion made its final departure from 
Britain, and gave melancholy afllirances they fhould never return, artificers could 
not be found to maintain the barrier with mafon work; but the breaches were 
fupplied with turf.
Then it w-as, as hiflorians tell us, the diftraCted inhabitants 
looked abroad on their deferted country, and faw nothing was left them but poverty 
and difmay: either the Romans had kept thofe left behind them in profound 
ignorance as to the manufactory of arms and tools of hufbandry, or the work- 
men had deferted them with the Romans ; for fo it w'as, that none remaining had 
either military fkill or arms to defend themfelves from the ravages of the enemy.
The warlike and ferocious bands, who poflefled the northern regions, from their 
implacable averfion to the Romans, remaining uncontaminated with their vices, 
and not become imbecilitated by their luxuries, rufhed forth like a troop of lions 
on the affrighted country, and fpread defolationand ruin on every hand; carrying 
back with them the herds and flocks of the aftonifhed Britons, many of w horn, with 
their wives and infants, were made (laves ; whilfl others fled fouthward, to fave a 
miferable exigence.
Such is the afflicting picture given of this country.
But in 
the heightening of r his grievous delineation, writers omit the proofs neceflary to 
reconcile this deplorable defeription of the eflate of Britain, fo immediately after 
the departure of the Romans; for it could only be derived from the emigration of 
thofe who had become intimately connected with the Romans, had participated 
in the luxuries and pleafures of their manners, and had a lfo acquired a knowledge 
of arms, arts, and manufactories ; from fuch the art of war could not be withheld, 
as it was to be obtained by example.
At this period, it feems moft probable, that vaffalage was growing into a cuflom; 
and that the captives made by contending powers, were in retaliation carried into 
flavery.
It is mentioned that one of the original articles of traffic with Greece was 
jlavcs: but there is no evidence, who thofe miferable objeCts were; whether cap- 
tives or criminals.
It is the cuflom of moft barbarous nations, in their warfare, 
to enflave the unhappy captive.
In the introduction to the View of Northumberland , we took notice of the deplo- 
rable eflate of the Britons, before the arrival of the Saxons; regarding this as a 
work connected with our former publication, we forbear the repetition.
It doth not appear that this diftriCt experienced any of thofe calamities which 
marked the eaftern coaft, and Northumberland in particular, on the firft approach 
of the Saxons : neither did they poflefs the lands on the weflern fide of the Bririlh 
AppenineSy (which divide the counties, according to their prefent limits) when they 
firfl devifed the plan, and concerted meafures to feize the empire , and fnatch

from the hand of impotence and imbecility, the government of a country fo bleft 
with the bounteous gifts of providence, and fo perfe&ly adapted to the happy 
exigence of mankind.
The fettlement of the Saxons in Northumberland was effected in or about the year 
454; but it was not till the year 547, that Ida came over with his reinforcements, 
and eftablifhed his kingdom.
This country was inhabited at that time by a people who affirmed the name of 
Kumbri or Kimbri, from whence the etymology of Kumbri Land is very eafily and 
naturally deduced.
f 
There is no degree of evidence to {hew, that Ida carried his arms acrofs the 
mountains; but it feems he was content to fettle on the eaftern coaft: and by 
making Bebbanborough his royal fortrefs, the pofftion feems evidently proved.
Such 
proofs as we have, tend toconfiimthe idea, and that this province, now theobjetff of 
our particular attention, was not fubjedto his cont-roul ; for the Kimbri had become 
conciliated to the Maat^e, the Pills and Scots , who dwelt upon, or li\ed adjacent 
to, what we now call the Borders and they appear to have joined in feveral meur- 
iions on the Saxon fettlements, ravaging their frontiers by flying parries ; and, after 
marking their hafty pafiage with blood and rapine, retreating again with equal 
rapidity to their impenetrable laffneffes in the mountains and forefts, where no 
other people could fubfiff.
The twelve years of Ida's reign were full of warfare ; and all that he reaped from 
his military achievements againft the Britons, was barely to retain his firff fettlc- 
ment in Northumberland .
Adda , his fon and fucceflor, reigned for the {hort period of feven years; one of 
his chieftains Ella is faid to have added to this fovereignty the province of Deira t 
from whence he expelled the Britons ; but in this acquifition, it is prefumed, we 
cannot include the territories of the Kimbri; but that thofe conquefts.
were ex- 
tended fouthward; and that Ella did not crofs our Appenines in this war.
It is not till the reign of Ethelfrith, which commenced in the year 593, that we 
hear any thing of the conflicts of the Saxons with the Pills ; and under this general 
appellation of their enemy, we are inclined to include the Kimbri.
That prince extended his conqueft much further than any of his predeceflors ; 
and many tribes of the Britons fubmitted, his arms being deemed irreffftible, and 
his mode of government excellent and full of ( lemency.
It is in this aera we are 
induced to place the firff footing of Saxon power within this diftritff; for hifforians 
fay, that, by the extent of empire gained by Ethelfrith , the Scots began to look

upon his growing fame with a jealous eye, and upon his government as advancing 
to too eminent a degree of power, for the fecurity and peace of the adjoining hates : 
under fuch apprehenfions, the Scots taking up arms, a decifive vicftory was obtained 
by the Saxons at Deegltane , or dâ€™Egleftane, as fome authors have it,* where the 
(laughter was fo great, that the natives were not able to advance again intp the field 
againft the invaders for (everal years.
The Mreatce and Pills have, by all hiftori- 
ans, been accounted a more fouthern people, than the Scots ; and it feems probable, 
that the acceftion of Cumbria excited their jealoufy : and w hat (Lengthens this 
fuppolition, that Cumbria was added to Ethelfrithâ€™s dominions, is, his pro(ecuting 
a war againft the fouthern and weftern tribes of Britons, over whom a decifive 
victory was obtained near Caer Leon t in Wales.
Jn the reign of Edwin , the Mercians overran the kingdom of Northumberland , 
and laid it wafte; in that general devaftation it is to be doubted, the Kimbri were 
fufferers.
In 684, Egfrid had poffeflion of the w'eftern coaft, as he invaded Ireland: and 
afterwards, contrary to the advice of St. Cuthbert , then Bifhop of Lindisfarn, he 
turned his arms againft the Pib/s, and was (lain.
At this period of time, the city 
of Car'ijle was given to St. Cuthbert , and his fee s and he was brought thither to 
preach to the inhabitants.
The Kimbri then were reconciled and fully united to 
the Saxon government.
Though we have alleged, that Cumbria was joined to the Saxon kingdom of 
Northumberland ; yet it appears only to have been a tributary province , under the 
referved government of its own potentates.
It continued to hold the privilege to 
about the year 946, at which time, as Camden's words are, â€œ King Edmund, J 
c â€˜ with the aftiftanceof Leoline, King ol Wales, fpoiled Cumberland of all its riches; 
tf and having put out the eyes of Dunmaile, king of that country, granted that 
" kingdom to Malcolm, King of Scots, to hold of him to prote<ft the northern 
tf part of England, by fea and land, againft the incurfions of enemies.
Upon which, 
â€œ the eldeft fons of the Kings of Scotland, as well under the Saxons as Danes, were

But when England had yielded tothe Normans, 
â€œ this county fubmitted with the reft, and fell tothe (hare of Ranulph de Mefchines, 
Â«* whofe eldeft fon was lord of Cumberland, and at the fame time, in right of

â€œ the Scotifh king, as Newbrigencies has it, wifely confidered, that fince the King 
Â«* of England both had a better title, and was much flronger in thofe parts (though 
â€œ he could have alleged the oath, which he was faid to have made to his grand- 
â€œ father David) did very fairly and honeftly reftore the aforefaid bounds, at the 
t( kingâ€™s demand, and in lieu of them had Huntingdonfhire reftored, which be- 
â€œ longed to him of ancient right.â€ 
Such are the general circumftances related by Camden; but we mull: revert to 
an earlier date than 946, to collect: fome very material incidents antecedent to 
that sera.
In the year 873, the Danes made their landing at Tynemouth , and wintered in 
that neighbourhood ; in the enfuing fpring, they fpread their ravages from the 
eaftern to the weftern ocean, over thofe parts of the Northumbrian kingdom , which, 
in their former incurfions, they had not traverfed.
They pillaged and afterwards 
burnt the city of Carli/le.
It doth not appear that they met with much refinance in 
this diftridT, or made any confiderable ftay, for there are no remains of their military 
works, either entrenchments or forts, except at Brampton: and in our opinion this 
greatly denotes the poverty of the land, its being thinly peopled, and the unreco- 
vered flate it lay in, from the defertion of the Romans, the ravages of the northern 
nations , and the warfare of the Saxons.
In the year 894, Alfred reduced the whole kingdom of Northmnberland.
Fordtin 
relates that the northern provinces of England willingly fubmitted to Gregory, King 
of Scots ; Donald fucceeded, and retained the acquifitions of his father; and after 
him Conftantine.
This author is not always to be confided in, efpecially when he 
has a means of aggrandizing the Scotch name.
Alfred divided his realm into fhires 
and their fubdivifions of wards or hundreds ; of which there are five in Cumberland , 
viz.
A ller dale ward above Derwent, Allerdale ward below Derwent , Cumberland ward , 
Lceth ward, and Kfkdale ward.
In the year 941, Edmund fucceeded to the Englifh throne, and two years after 
Malcolm w as King of Scotland.
The Englifh monarch, provoked by the perfidy of 
the northern provinces, wafted Cumberland, and granted it to Malcolm , on terms 
that Induff, the heir apparent to the Scotch crown, and his fucceftors, likewife heirs, 
fhould hold it as their principality, and a province of that realm, by fealty and 
homage.
As a teftimony of this grant, the Scotch hiftorians fay, the Reay-crofs 
or Roy-crofs was placed on Stainmore , on the boundary of IVeJlmorland and Torkfhire , 
the arms of England being fculptured on the fouthfide, and the arms of Scotland 011 
the north, as a memorial of that convention, and the divifion of the two kingdoms.
We have taken a fhort view r of the melancholy events which marked this diftridl 
under the ravages of a foreign enemy, and barbarities of theferocious inhabitants of 
the north, then uncivilized and unenlightened with the Chriftian revelation: fuch 
incidents of the likecaft, as follow in our narrative, were derived from natives, who 
it might be conceived would naveadied with greater clemency and humanity towards 
their neighbours; born in the fame land, and brethern in the pale of the fame church.
About the year 1031, Uchtred, Earl of Northumberland, began to commit depre- 
dations on Cumberland , fupported by the Danes.
Malcolm led forth his army, and 
engaged them near Burgh on Sands y where, after a doubtful battle, maintained with 
equal

equal valour for a long time, the bloody honours of the day were gained by the Scots.
Duncan , the heir-apparent of the crown, held the principality, agreeable to Edmund's 
compad ; but Malcolm , regarding Canute as an ufurper, would not permit his fon to 
do homage.
Canute made a pilgrimage to Rome, and on his return, having levied 
a great army, he advanced into Cumberland to take revenge for the indignities re- 
ceived from the crown of Scotland: authors difagree exceedingly in the event of this 
expedition; if we give credit to the Saxon chronicle , Canute fubdued Malcolm , with 
two other potentates, Mcelbeath and Johmarc ; but whothofe perfonages w'ere, we 
are in the dark, nothing being left us but their names.
This account is adopted by 
Malmjbury ; but Symeon of D inham, and Florence , of Worcejier, are totally filent 
thereon.
Fordun correfponds with the chronicle , and Matthew of Wejlminjler fpeaks 
in the following expreflions : â€œ Contra Scotos rebellantes hofilem expcdilionem duxit, 
â€œ et Malcolmum regem, cum duobus aliis regibus , levi negotio, fuperavit â€™Â§ But we 
are inclined to adopt the account of more modern writers, who tell us thar, by 
the interpofition of the great men of both Rates, and a circumRantial inveRigation 
of the right of the Scottilh crown, Cumberland was confirmed to Duncan , and the 
homage required was paid.
Thefecond year afterthe ufurpation of thecrown of England by William the Nor- 
man , the northern malccontents were in arms, and the aid of Malcolm , of Scotland, 
was promifed ; but he not being able to bring up his troops in time to aid the allies, 
the two Rates were indebted to the good offices of Egelwin, Bifhop of Durham, for ef- 
fedtinga reconciliation and ceRation of hoRilities; and the Scotch king did homage 
accordingly for this principality; but this was nota permanent peace, for, inthefuc- 
ceeding year, William having fent Robert Cummin into Northumberland , with a chofen 
body of troops, in order to keep the malecontents in awe, they eluded the leaderâ€™s 
vigilance, in the night forced the gates of Durham, where Cummin then lay, and put 
his men to the fword.
This, with the lubfequent rebellion at York, and theinva- 
fion of the Scots , whofe forces were Rrengthened with an army of Danes and 
Northumbrians , headed by Earl Gofpatric , incenfed William to march with a power- 
ful army, and to lay waRe the whole country northward from 1 ork* Malcolm 
entered Cumberland, and there exhibited a fcene of exploits as infernal as the 
Normans.
He carried his devaRation into Yeefdale and the county of Durham.
In 
1072, William came again into the north, and entering Scotland, was met by 
Malcolm at Abernethy, w r here the Scotch monarch, confenting to perform the 
accuRomed homage, a peace was concluded.
But it doth not appear that Lumber -

The events attending the contentions of the two crowns were dreadful to this 
country: the inhabitants were continually harafled with warfare, the herds and 
flocks were fwept away, women and children carried into bondage, multi- 
tudes of men put to the fword, towns, monafleries, and churches facked, pil- 
laged and laid in alhes: fo that this diftrid:, w hich bore marks of the refentment 
and violence of both parties, muft have worn the countenance of defolation and 
diftrefs for many centuries.
The conflids were as favage and ferocious, and at- 
tended with as great barbarity, as appear in the annals of any country; they did 
not ufe the fcalping knife and tomahawk , but they ftained the foil with every degree 
of cruelty the age had devifed.
As far as poflible to remedy this public evil.
The 
BORDER SER VICE commenced ; diftind in its nature, and totally unconneded 
with other military fervice.
Its rife was cotemporary w ith the divifion of Cum- 
berland under Ranulph de Mef chines.
At the firing of beacons ,Â§ or the alarm given 
by the horn , the owner of every landed eflate, according to his rank, was obliged 
to arm and array: but as this inftitution, in its infant ftate, did not effed the pur- 
pofes for w'hich it was devifed, and until the reign of King Edzvard 1.
was not 
brought into a regular conflitution, we will, in the intermediate time, take a view 
of the feveral incidents in which this county was concerned.
In theyear 1091, Malcolm , of Scotland, difladsfied with the acceflion of William 
Rufus tothe crown of England, in deprivation of his brother Robert , tookadvantageof 
the timewhenadifcontentprevailed, entered the borders with his army, and ravaged 
rhe country, returning with great fpoil.
Rufus foon after coming from Normandy, 
prepared with a vaft armament by fea and land, to make a formidable attack upon 
Scotland ; but the feafon was too far advanced, the equinodial winds prevailed, his 
fleet was great part of it wrecked, and his army fuffered almofl: an equal diflrefs by 
the inclemency of the weather: a peace was effeded, and Malcolm did homage, to 
hold the pofleflions from the crown of England, which were granted to him in the 
time of William the father; viz.
twelve towns in England , and an annual penfion 
of twelve marks of gold.
Though the war produced no beneficial event in favour 
of this county, yet the prefence of the fovereign did ; for King William Rufus was 
delighted with the fituation of Carlijle ; he faw it was placed under a clement Iky, 
and happy climate, furrounded with a fertile country, and capable of receiving all 
the bounties of Providence, by the hands of Induftry.
He ordered the city to be

fortified the whole, and built a fortrefs for its fecurity; and therein placed a ftrong 
garrifon.
In a fhort time afterwards, he removed the former garrifon, and fent 
troops thither, drawn from the fouthern counties, fkilful in agriculture; who intro- 
duced tillage : for, from the time that the Romans departed, the ploughfhare had 
not divided the foil ; and the inhabitants are deferibed to have become as totally 
ignorant of the cultivation of their lands, as if corn had never grown in the diftridt.
Before this time, the fcanty provifion of bread for the people was brought by land; 
for they had no navigation but by canoes and open boats, with which they feldom 
ventured to Ireland or the ljie of Man ; and Scotland was an hoftile land.

In the year 1135, David , King of Scotland, incenfed at Stephenâ€™s ufurpation, 
entered fuch parts of England as were neareft to his place of refidence; and, at the 
head of a powerful army, compelled the inhabitants to fw ear allegiance and fidelity 
to his neice, the Emprefs Maud ; and to give hoftages.
He took pofleflion of the 
chief places of ftrength; and, among others, reduced the city of Carlijle, and placed 
a Scotch garrifon there.
In the year 1138, as David advanced fouthward, previ- 
ous to the battle of AUerlon , befi known by the name of the battle of the ftandard , 
he was joined by the men of Cumberland and Carlijle.
In 1 1 54, King Henry II.
demanded of Malcolm IV.
then King of Scotland , that 
he fhould make full reftitution of the northern provinces , which King Stephen had 
imprudently given up: the young monarch not only acquiefced with the requeft, 
but being prefent with the King of England at Cbefter, in the year 1 157, when he 
was making war againft the Welch , received confirmation of Huntingdonfhire, and 
did homage for the fame.
Prince Henry having conceived a project to depofe his father, King Henry II.
by 
promifing to reftore to the crown of Scotland the counties of Northumberland and 
Cumberland , engaged Willia?n the Lion, King of Scotland, to aid him; among other 
fruitlefs attempts, he befieged Carlijle, and was obliged to withdraw his troops 
with difgrace; but coming again before it, the city capitulated.
In the year 1 194, King William of Scotland, on the acceffion of King Richard I.
claimed reftitution of the ancient honours of his crown, part of which was the 
province of Cinnberland ; the death of the Englifh monarch happening foon after, 
the matter remained undetermined: but the Scotch king, unwilling to relinquifh 
his claim, renewed it with King John, who evaded bringing the bufmefs to a con- 
clufion.
The Scorch king, dying in the year 1214, left Alexander II.

To him the northern Englifh barons had re- 
courfe for protection againft the tyranny of King John; and did homage at Fel-

marked his progrefs from York northward, by burning and laying wade tlie whole 
country, and fuch adts of inhumanity and bloodfhed, as never defiled the hands 
of a Carabbee or American chieftain.
The Scots were irritated to follow the fame 
favage example; they penetrated into England as far as Richmond in Yorkfliire: 
and returning home by IVefimorland and Cumbetland , deftroyed thofe miferable 
counties ; fo that, by the arms of thofe fpoilers, the ruinous marks of the moft 
favage warfare were extended between fea and fea, through the whole trad!
of 
country from York to Haddington.
The exafperated barons called upon Louis of 
France to receive the crown of England ; but the timely death of King John put 
a ftop to an acceflion, which the hands of defpair and rage were upon the eve of 
eflablifhing, to the utter ruin of Britifh liberties and rights.
King Alexander, in 
this interval, took care to obtain a recognition of his right, from the barons of 
Louis's party; and that princeâ€™s confirmation of the province of Cumberland.
In the year 1235, Alexander , the Scottifh King, made a peremptory demand of 
reftitution of the county of Cumberland , &c.
from King Henry III.
and threatened 
hoftilities, which, in the fituation of the young monarch, were to be avoided by all 
polfible means ; a conference was appointed to be held at York , at which Otho, the 
popeâ€™s legate, prefided ; when, in full fatisfadlion of all the claims of the King 
of Scots, King Henry agreed to afiign lands of the yearly value of 200I.
within 
the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland , if lands of that value could be 
found therein, without the limits of thofe towns w here caflesxvtvt eredled.
Alex- 
ander feems to have been induced to accept this compromife, in confideration of 
the popeâ€™s great influence; who even claimed the kingdom of England from the 
interdict of John : the King of Englandâ€™s alliances, by marriage, w ere very power- 
ful ; and the diffident barons, in whom Alexander had placed fome confidence, 
grew cool on his fide; all which unpropitious circumfiances influenced the King 
of Scotlandâ€™s refolutions.
It was not till the year 1 242, that Nicholas de Yarneham , 
Bifhop of Durham , was appointed, by royal commiffion, to affign the lands; when 
Penrith and Sozverby were allotted : from whence it appears that the caftle of Penrith, 
now in ru ins, is of a later date than that tranfadlion ; and that Maybrough , in that 
neighbourhood, was never confidered as an ancient fortrefs.
The firft regular order in the fervice of the Borders, and the laws inftituted for 
that purpofe, appear to be fubfequent to Alexander's refignation ; and in the reign 
of King Edward I, Robert de Clifford was the firft who bore the title of Lord IVar- 
dcn of the Marches, to w hich he was called in the twenty-third year of his age, 
A. D.

Days of Marche fo appointed, proclamation is to be made, and flraite letters of commandment direÂ£led 
in the queenâ€™s majeilyâ€™s name, for all lords, knights, efquires, gentlemen, and feveral officers, with con- 
venient numbers of their charge and tenants (as time and fervice require) for to repair the night before, 
and give their attendance upon the lord warden unto the laid day of Marche, defeneibly arrayed, with 
their bed horfes and nags, the morrow next following.
Which done, 
The lord warden, attended with the gentlemen, officers, fervants, and their powers, is to ride from the 
place where he inhabiteth, unto the Marche bank, all flaying there without riding any further, or going 
over the dream, if there be water, or bounds if it be dry land : 
Until 
The lord warden of England fird of all (the oppofite warden known to be come to the place appoint- 
ed) doth fend either his deputy, or fome other fpecial gentleman of good worth whom it pleafeth him for 
to make choice of, with a convenient number of the bed horfed and mod fufficient gentlemen of his com- 
pany, unto the warden of Scotland, fignifying his repair thither, and craving affurance during their meet- 
ing until the funrifing of the next day following.
Which affurance being required by England and granted by Scotland ; the Scotch warden holding up 
his hand, engages for performing thereof in all refpe&s.
Then the deputy and other gentlemen of England, returning back to the lord warden of England, are 
to make relation of the affurance granted, and confent for the prefervation of the amity.
For thwith after.
The lord warden of Scotland fendeth his deputy, or fome other fpecial gentleman, accompanied with 
othtrs of the bed fort of horfemen, unto the lord warden of England, ffiewing that the lord warden of 
Scotland yieldeth to allow and confirm the affurance demanded for England, craving the like for Scotland} 
which the warden of England, holding up his hand, granteth.
This done, 
ff he deputy of Scotland and his company return back to the warden of Scotland, declaring the grant- 
ing of the affurance by England.
The lord warden of England, before he or any of his company enter into Scotland, caufeth proclama- 
tion to be made for obfervation of the peace, for old feuds and new, word, deed, and countenance, from 
the time of the proclaiming thereof, until the next day at the funrifing, upon pain of death.

often as any danger of a liege appeared, to mufter all fenlible men, between the 
ages of lixteen and fix ty, within the marches; and all men at arms, billmen and 
archers, according to their degree, who were to refort to him properly armed ; to 
be maifh lied in thoufands, hundreds, and twenties ; and fo arrayed to defend and 
keep the fame.
He had authority to agree to ceffations of arms, and conclude 
treaties of peace ; to appoint deputies and warden ferjeants and other officers.
In his civil capacity, he was to take cognizance of all breaches of the border laws, 
imprifonments, robberies, and fpoils ; to hold warden's courts and feffiions, therein 
to hear all matters between the people of both kingdoms ; and by the laws efla- 
blilhed, to redrefs all grievances; to arreft and imprifon all perfons difcovered 
to be in league with the enemies of the crown of England.
The border laws obliged the lord warden yearly to produce his commillion, and 
take the oath of office, at the Midfummer Affembly of the people of both nations.
â€”A council was to attend the lord warden, chofen of difcrete borderers.
The 
offences chiefly to be enquired of, were murder, w r ounding, and maiming, burning 
of houfes, corn, &c.
rapine and theft, deadly feud, a threatening of life in revenge ; 
cutting and taking au'ay timber trees ; fowing corn, and depafturing cattle beyond 
the eftablifhed limits, hunting out of proper boundaries, &c.
A thief might be 
purfued into the oppofite realm within fix days, and the chace carried on, as the 
term is, in hot trod , with hound, and horn, with hue-and-cry : in which purfuits, 
receivers and refcuers of the fugitive were equally punifhable with the principal.
Loiterers not having vifible occupations, were not permitted.
Letters of fafe con- 
dud; were granted to perfons, whofe neceflary bufinefs required them to travel into 
the oppofite realm.
Days of public juftice were flipulated for redrefs of griev- 
ances, and to put in execution the laws of the borders ; in which perjury had a 
penalty.
If any one attempted to make retaliation, he lofl his remedy at law.

Extrafl from the Report of Sir Thomas Carlton, of Carlton-Hall, 1547 .
â€œ We made a road into Tiviotdale, and got a great booty of goods, and that night we lay in the old 
walls of Wawcop tower, and builded to-falls ; went to Dumfries and lay there, who fubmitted thcmfelves 
to become the kingâ€™s fubje&s.
But the town of Kirkobree refufed, infomuch, that the lord Wharton 
moved me, if it were poflible, with fafety, to give th^ fame town a praiffe to burn it.
And fo we rode 
thither one night, and coming a little after funriling, they who faw us coming barred their gates, and kept 
their dikes ; for the town is diked on both fides, with a gate to the water-ward, and a gate in the over-end 
to the fell- ward.
There we lighted on foot, and gave the town a (harp onfet and affault, and flew one 
honeft man in the town with an arrow ; infomuch, that one wife came to the ditch, and called for one, that 
would take her hufbaad and fave his life.
Anthonâ€™ Armftrong being ready, faid, fetch him to me, and 
Iâ€™ll warrant his life.
The woman ran into the town, and fetched her hufband, and brought him through 
the dike to the faid Anthonâ€™, who brought him into England, and ranfomed him.
We gave Bombey 
the onfet, and fo we returned, feized about 2000 fheep, 200 kye and oxen, and 40 or 50 horfes, and 
brought the fame towards Dumfries.

led by E discard Brus and Sir James Douglas , having entered England by Reedefdale , 
returned through Giljland , where they made the inhabitants take the oath of alle- 
giance to Robert Brus ; and exacting contributions, the county of Cumberland paid 
600 marks.
It is faid by fome authors, that the Scotch leaders took up their 
residence 
place called the Forehead Ford.
So we left all our ftieep, and put our word; horfemen before the nowte 
and nags, and fent 30 of the bell horfed to preeke at the Scots, if they would come over the water, and 
I to abide with the ftandard in their relief : which the Scots perceiving, came not over.
So that we 
palled quietly that night to Dumfries, leaving the goods in fafety with men and good watch.
In the 
morning we repaired to the goods, a mile beyond Dumfries, of intent to have divided and dealt the booty ; 
and fome claimed this cow, and fome that nag, to be under afiurance, and ran through the goods.
Above 
all, one man of the laird of Empsfield came amongft the goods, and would needs take a cow, faying, he 
would be flopped by no man, infomuch, that one Thomas Taylor, called Tom with the bow, being one 
of the garrifon, and being charged with keeping the goods, ftruck the faid Scotfman on the head with his 
bow, fo that the blood ran down over his Ihoulders.
Going to his mafter there, and crying out, his mafter 
went with him to the ma'ler Maxwell.
The mafter Maxwell came, with a great rout after him, and 
brought the man with the bloody head to me, â€œ Is this, think ye, wele ; both to tak our goods, and thus 
to (hed our blood ?â€ I confidering the mafter at that prefent two for one, thought beft to ufe him and 
the reft of the Scots with good words, and gentle and fair fpeeches, for they were determined, even there, 
to have given us an onfet, and to have taken the goods from us, and to have made that their quarrel.
I thought it good to pra&ife fome way we might get fome hold or caftle, where we might lie near the 
enemy, and to lie within our own ftrength in the night, where we might lie down together, and rife 
together.
Thus prattifing, one Sander Armftrong, fon of ill Will Ai mftrong, came to me, and told me, 
he had a man called John Lynton, who was born at the head of Annerdale, near to the Loughwood, 
being the laird of Johnfonâ€™s chief houfe, and the faid laird and his brother (being the abbot of Salfide) 
were taken prifoners not long before, and were remaining in England.
It was a fair large tower, able to 
lodge our company fafely, with a barnekin, hall, kitchen, and ftables, all within the barnekin, and was 
but kept with two or three fellows, and as many wenches.
He thought it might be fiolen in the morn- 
ing at the opening of the tower door, which I required the faid Sandee to pradlife.
At laft it was agreed 
that we (hould go with the whole garrifon.
We came there about an hour before day ; and the greater 
part of us lay clofe without the barnekin : but about a dozen of the men got over the barnekin wall, and 
Hole clofe into the houfe within the barnekin, and took the wenches and kept them fecure till day light.
And at funriiing, two men and a woman being in the tower, one of the men riling in his Ihirt, and going 
to the tower head, and feeing nothing ftir about, he called on the wench that lay in the tower, and bade 
her rife and open the tower door, and call up them that lay beneath.
She fo doing, and opening the 
iron door, and a wood door without it, our men within the barnekin brake a little too foon to the door ; 
for the wench perceiving them, leaped back into the tower, and had gotten almoft the wooden door to ; 
but one got hold of it, fo that fire could not get it câ€™ofe to ; fo the fiurmifh rofe, and we over the barnekin, 
and broke open the wood door, and fire being troubled with the wood door, left the iron door open, and 
fo we entered and wan the Loughwood ; where we found, truely, the houfe well purveyed for btef falted, 
malt, big, havermeal, butter, and cheefe.â€

An 
inftance or two from Sir Robert Caryâ€™s memoirs, will Ihew the deadly feuds, and favage manners of the 
people.
â€œ I wrote to Sir Robert Ker, my oppofite warden ; after he had filled my man with drink, and put 
him to bed, he and fome half a fcore with him got to horfe, and came into England, to a little village ; 
there he broke up a houfe, and took out a poor fellow, who (he pretended) had done him fome wrong, 
and before the door cruelly murdered him, and fo came quietly home and went to bed.
The next morn- 
ing he deliverd my man a letter in anfwer to mine, and returned him to me.
It pleafed me well at the 
reading of this kind letter, but when I heard what a bravo he had put upon me, I quickly refolved never to 
have to do with him, till I was righted for the great wrong he had done me.
There was a favourite of Sir Robertâ€™s, a great thief, called Geordic Bourne.
This gallant, with fome 
of his aflociates, would in bravery, come and take goods in the Eaft Marche.

refidence at Rofe Cajlle> from whence the troops were fent out in parties to levy 
the fum demanded, and on refufal to burn and deftroy.
Although the.
plague raged dreadfully, both in England and Scotland, two years 
were fcarce elapfed from the lafl incuriion, before the Scots made another inroad, 
under the command of Lord Douglas , and penetrated as far as Richmond , in York- 
fhire, and Furnefs in Lancafhire, marking their paffage with deflation and ruin : 
and in the 13th year of the fame reign, they made another incuriion and wafted 
the whole country, from Giljland to Burgh under Stainmoie.
In the year 1322, Andrew de Liar cla % governor of tarlijle , was invefted with 
military command over the northern counties, to iupprefs the infurre&ions : but 
it was foon difcovered, that this confidence was improperly placed in one who 
was confederate with the Scots : of which being convi&ed, he was degraded, and 
decollated 
the garrifon abroad.
They met with this Geardie and his fellows driving the cattle before them.
The 
garrifon fet upon them, and with a {hot killed Geordie Bournâ€™s uncle ; and he himfelf bravely refilling, 
till he was fore hurt in the head, was taken.
After he was taken, his pride was fuch, as he alked, who 
it was that durft avow that nightâ€™s work ?
but when he heard it was the garrifon, he was then more quiet.
I called a jury the next morning, and he was found guilty of marche-treafon.
When all things were quiet, 
and the watch fet at night, after fupper, about ten oâ€™clock, I took one of my men s liveries, and put it 
about me, and took two other of my fervants with me in their liveries, and we three, as the wardenâ€™s men, 
came to the provoft Marfhalâ€™s, where Bourne was, and were let into his chamber.
We fat down by him, 
and told him, that we were defirous to fee him, becaufe we heard he was flout and valiant, and true to hi3 
friend ; and that we were forty our mafler could not be moved to fave his life.
He voluntarily of himfelf 
laid, that he had lived long enough to do fo much as he had done, and withal told us.
that he had lain 
with above forty menâ€™s wives, what in England, what in Scotland â€¢ and that he had killed feven Englifti- 
men with his own hands : that he had fpent his whole time in whoring, drinking.
Healing, and taking deep 
revenge for flight offences.
After I heard his own confeflion, I was refolved no conditions Ihould fave his 
life ; and fo took order, that at the gates opening the next morning, he Ihould be carried to execution, 
which accordingly was performed.
Among other malefactors, there were two gentlemen thieves, that robbed and took purfes from travel- 
lers in the highways (a theft that was never heard of in thofe parts before) I got them betrayed, took 
them, and fent them to Newcaftle goal, and there they were hanged.
There had been an ancient cuftom of the borders, when they were at quiet, for the oppofite border to 
fend the warden of the Middle Marche, to defire leave that they might come into the borders of England, 
and hunt with their greyhounds for deer, towards the end of fummer, which was denied them.
Towards 
the end of Sir John Forfterâ€™s government, they would, without afleing leave come into England and 
hunt at their pleafure, and flay their own time.
1 wrote to Farnehurft, the warden over againfl.
me, that 
I was no way willing to hinder them of their accuftomed fports ; and that if, according to the ancient 
cuftom, they would fend to me for leave, they Ihould have all the contentment I could give them ; if other- 
wife, they would continue their wonted courfe, I would do my beft to hinder them.
Within a month 
after, they came and hunted as they ufed to do, without leave, and cut down wood, and carried it away.
. 
Towards the end of fummer, they came again to their wonted fports.
I fent my two deputies with all 
the fpeed they could make, and they took along with them fuch gentlemen as were in their way, with my 
forty horfe, and about one oâ€™clock they came up to them, and fet upon them.
Some hurt was done, but 
1 gave efpecial order, they fhould do as little hurt, and ftied as little blood as pofiible they could.
They 
took a dozen of the principal gentlemen that were there, and brought them to me to Witherington, where 
I then lay, I made them welcome, and gave them the beft entertainment I could ; they lay in the 
caftle two or three days, and fo I fent them home, they alluring me that they would never hunt again with- 
out leave.

In the firft year of the reign of King Edward III.
the Scots under the command 
of the earl of Murray and lord Douglas entered England near Carlijle : the troops 
confided of twenty four thoufand horfe; they penetrated through Cumberland into 
the mountainous parts of Northumberland and Durham ; and though king Edward 
had advanced with an army of 100,000 men, they avoided coming to battle, and 
made a fafe retreat, returning with confiderable booty.
In the year 1333, lord Archibald Douglas with 3000 chofen men entered Gilfland , 
and laid wade the edate of lord Dacre, for thirty miles in extent: a retaliation was 
made by Sir Anthony Lucy , in which it appears, that the Englifh were not inferior 
to their neighbours in barbarity and rapine.
In the 19th year of King Edward III.
the Scots made an incurfion by Carlijle , 
which place they laid in allies; then advancing to Penrith , they facked and burnt 
that town; and returning through Giljland> carried off much cattle.
In the fuc- 
cecdingyear King David Brus headed the dedrudlive bands, waded Cumberland 
as far as Derwent fells ; and on his return made his route by Aldflone Moore.
En- 
couraged by this luccefs, the Scotch monarch the next year, advanced to the city 
of Durham , where at the battle of Nevilâ€™s Crofs y he was made prifoner, and his 
powerful army totally routed.

INTRODUCTION.
In the 6th year of the reign of King Richard II.
the Scots palled through the 
foreft oS Englewood, and entered Penrith at the time of the fair, where they caufed 
much bloodlhed and pillaged the town.
With the merchandife, it is fuppofed 
they carried the pelf ilence into their own country, by which one third of the people 
died.
The Englifh to retaliate, made their palfage over Solway Frith , and took 
great booty, but in return, fell into a defile, where 400 were llain, and many in 
their precipitate flight w'ere drowned.
In the 1 ith year of King Richard II.
the Scots palled over the Frith, furprifed 
Cockermouth ; and with their plunder, returned through the heart of the country.
In the reign of King Henry VI.
inroads were frequent, and attended with in- 
creafed barbarity, and want of mercy ; the produce of the land, the flocks and herds 
were fwept away; the women and children were made captives, and carried into 
the fevereft and moft abjed flavery: fo much did the calamaties of war prevail, 
that this country was then almoft totally defolated and deftroyed.
Hiftory doth 
not record bafer ads of hoftility committed by the Scotch, than thofe of which the 
Englifh were guilty; it was our purpofe, in this review', only to relate the fuccef- 
five diftrefles, to w hich the difirid where our attention is placed, was fubjed: the 
Scotch borders often fmoaked in ruins ; their towns were facked, their lands were 
overrun, the inhabitants brought into bondage, and the hoftile fword drenched the 
vallies in blood : fuch were the reciprocal miferies of the border war.
The detail is 
dreadful; but in the hiftorian it is a neceflary though painful talk, to enumerate 
the circumflances ; as they lead the mind of the reader at once to determine, how 
miferable mull; have been the eftate of this land under thecontentionsof two ferocious 
nations, wafting their ftrength in inteftine broils; whofe nature and fpirit, from the 
climate, are adapted to warfare and military achievements ; and in the next place, 
he is led to the higheft exultation, in the retrofpedion of thofe blefiings which have 
flowed from the union, and that glory which the Britilh arms have every where ac- 
quired, fuperior to any ftate in Europe, fince the kingdoms were united.
It is not 
vain boafting, to fay, the Britilh navy and troops, are not to be equalled in the 
circuit of the globe.
It is confefled, the tribulation of the borders did not ceafe, with the reign of King 
Henry VI.
yet the incurfions were lefs frequent within this diftrid; the dreadful 
delineation is fufficiently protraded, from which we would now wifli to withdraw 
the readerâ€™s thoughts.
We have not been able to collect any certain evidence, at what period navigation 
w r as advanced in Cumberland ;Â£ it is, prefumed, that the ports were little frequented, 
f A furvey was taken by comm'flion from the crown, in the year 1566, of the trade and (hipping of 
this county, (inter alia ) Whitehavenwaslhen fo far from promifingit would ever arriveat its prefent wealthy 
and flouriihing ftate, that it confiftcd only of fix cottages fcattered on the beach, and hidden in the creek 
from the eye of an enemy; and to this deje&ed port one fmall bark only belonged, of nine or ten tuns 
burthen.
Nay, it is not more incredible than true, that there was, at that time, only one veflel apper- 
taining to the whole county that was of ten tuns burthen.
The manners were fifhermen, whofe hazard- 
ous employ got them a hard fubfiftence.
The whole exports of this extenfive county were nothing but a 
fmall quantity of herrings and codfifh, and the inhabitants knew, even at that sera, fo little of the luxuries 
and enjoyments of life, that the whole of this great coaft received no other imports than a little fait.

till after the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and remained almoft infignificant till the 
acceflion of King James I.* Workington was the chief haven, and the place of the 
exportation of certain criminals fentenced to bamfhmcnt in 1607, but in that fer- 
vice very few vefiels were employed.
The rife of Whitehaven was within a century, 
under the aufpices of the Lowther Jamily , where, at prefent, upwards of an hundred 
vefiels of confiderable burthen are conftantly employed, belonging to that port 
only ; â€” but as fuch matters will be efpecially treated of, as we proceed in the hif- 
tory of each place, this fuperficiai notice muft fuffice here.
The local wealth of this county confifts principally in its mines t of which the 
chief are of coal : copper, lead, black-lead, and flares, are alfo won here, and 
Camden fays, veins of gold and filver were difeovered in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth ; but fince that time they have not been fearched for.
The falmon 
trade hath, of late years, become confiderable, and much is fenr frefh to the London 
market; but little or none pickled or cured.
A confiderable number of black 
cattle and flieep f are bred within this diftrieft, but not of fo large a fize as thofe 
in Northumberland : large quantities of bacon and butter have, of late years, been 
fent to the London market ; and within thefe thirty years, large calico printfields 
and check manufactories have been eftablifhed in Carlifle and its vicinity ; fuch 
articles of trade as we have enumerated have arofe to a degree of fignificance within 
a century : in fhorr, one may fafely date the progrefs of that flourifhing ftate in 
which this county now appears, to be of no greater antiquity than from the union.
Population increafes rapidly, cultivation is advancing on every hand : and the molt 
flattering appearances, that this county will become of the greateft confequence to 
the ftate, and of import to the mercantile world, within the courfe of another cen~ 
tury, may be deduced from the growing manufactories, the increafe of tillage land, 
the fheep-walks and wool, the improved breed of cattle, the advance in flipping 
and number of mariners, and the flourifhing ftate of the mines.
* At the latter end of the fixteenth century, even under the aufpicious reign of Queen Elizabeth, when 
the naval power of this empire was advancing into a rivaifhip with all Europe, when trade and commerce, 
as from their native land, began to flourifli in Britain, fuperior to the reft of the European ftates ; when 
our interior ftrength and power difplayed ltfelf to the aftonifliment of the world, this county ftill lan- 
guiflied under its inaufpicious ftar ; diftant from the capital, unhappy in its vicinage, its improvements 
were much behind thofe of the more fouthern counties.
At this period, in or about the year 1582, the 
Earl of Lincoln , being Lord High Admiral, caufed an account to be taken of the (hips and mariners with- 
in this county, when all the veffels amounted only to twelve, and not one carried eighty tons.
Mariners and 
fifhermen made up the number 198, of whom many had never navigated a veffel fuperior to an open boat.
f It is of the utmoft confequence to this, and the other northern counties, to promote an explanatory 
law, touching the commoning of (heep ; for if legal determinations Ihould take place, to reftrain the 
fhepherd, to a rule of commoning or depafturing no greater number of flieep on the moors than can be 
wintered and fuppoited in the inclofed grounds, this great ftaple of the country would be almoft loft ; 
the poor (hepherds would be ruined, the ftock of provilion and wool would be diminifhed in a veiy great 
degree, and the common lands would lie wafte.
An attempt of this nature, by a perfecuting neighbour, 
has been made upon a poor (hepherd, who has a ftock of about 1500 (heep, in a neighbouring county, and 
he has been brought to two aflizes ; at the firft the (hepherd had a nonfuit in his favour, under the fadt, 
that the plaintiff exceeded in ftock of flieep, nearly in as great excels as the (hepherd, as appeared by 
the ftatement his own council made on the calculation of rentals ; at the next aflize the (hepherd obtained 
a verdict, it is prefumed, upon the fame ideaflriking the minds of the jurors If this example (hould be 
followed by any ore of an oppreffive mind, the confequence might be very injurious to the public, as well 
as the poor individual.
It is therefore a great provincial concern, to promote a law to encourage the 
breeding and depafturing fheep on the moors of the northern counties.

tenure, neither ftri6lly Feodal , Norman , or Saxon ; but mixed and compounded of 
them all : the heriots that attended them, befpeak them to have a tindtureof Dani(h .
Sir William Temple, in his introduction to his Englifh hiftory, fays, " Villeins 
â€œ were in a condition of downright fcroitnde , ufed and employed in the moji fervile works, 
â€œ and belonging , both they, their children and effetls , to the lord of the foil, like the reft 
t( of the cattle or flock upon it.â€ This never could have arofe among the troops of 
adventurers, who came here for booty and conqueft : there mull have been a degree 
of equality, though under a military fubordination, in thofe people ; and the villein, 
aifuredly was originally the captive in war.
After the lord had referved to himfelf 
a demefne, fufficient for the maintenance of his houfehold in corn and cattle, he 
allotted out the remainder of his territory into four parts : th efirft to his military 
tenants, to the intent, that their fervice to the fuperior lord, in arms, might be 
performed ; the fecond allotment was to his tenants in focage, who held their lands 
by fervice of the plough in the lordâ€™s demefne, or by rendering corn and cattle for 
the fupport of the lord and his military men, when arrayed: the third for villeins, 
who had fmall portions fet out for their fullenance, were amoveable at pleafure : 
and inconfequence of the lands being aliened, went over to the new acquirer, with- 
out any fpecial grant.
Thofe villeins were of two diftind: natures in the eye of the 
law : that is, villeins regardant, annexed to the manor or land ; or in grofs, that is, 
annexed to the perfon of the lord, and transferable, by deed, from one owner to 
another.
Lord Molefworth deferibes the Danijh boors, and Stiernhook the Fraals 
in Sweden, to be greatly fimilar to our villeins, which Judge Blackfione fays, 
tc confirms the probability of their being, in fome degree, monuments of the Danifto 
*< tyranny.â€ The fame learned writer is of opinion, that, on the arrival of the 
Normans, it is not impoffible, that they, who wâ€™ere ftrangers to any other than a 
Feodal fiate, might give fome degree of enfranchifement, to luch of the wretched 
flaves as fell to their {hare : many lords, by permitting the villeins and their children 
to continue in pofieflion of their lands, without interruption, lor a feries of years, 
gave them right of prefeription againft their lords, by common law ; and, on 
performance of the accufiomed fervices, they became entitled to hold the fame, 
in defiance of any determination of the lordâ€™s will : thence arofe thofe cuftoms , 
which having gained an entry by the lordâ€™s fteward on his roll, grew into a copy- 
hold tenure.

yet they come of an ancient houfe: and Judge Blackftone adds, u Copyholders are 
Â« in truth, no other but villeins , who, by a long feries of immemorial encroach- 
f< ments on the lord, have at length, eftablifhed a cuftomary right to thofe eftates, 
â€œ which, before, were held abfolutely at the lordâ€™s will : which affords a very 
Â« fubftantial reafon for the great variety of cufioms that prevail in different manors, 
Â« with regard both to the defcent of the eftates, and the privileges belonging to 
â€œ the tenants.â€ 
At the time of the ftatute of King Charles II.
it is obferved, that there was 
fcarce a pure villein, that is, a villein ingrofs , annexed to the lord's per/on , in the whole 
kingdom.
Sir Thomas Smith, who was fecretary to King Edward VI.
fays, he 
never knew a villein in grofs , throughout the realm ; and the few villeins regardant % 
that were then remaining, were fuch only as had belonged to bilhops, monafteries, 
or other ecclefiaftical corporations, in the preceding times of popery: â€œ the holy 
â€œ fathers, monks, and friars, had, in their confeflions, and efpecially in their ex- 
â€œ treme and deadly ficknefs, convinced the laity, how dangerous a practice it was 
â€œ for one Chriftian man to hold another in bondage : fo that temporal men, by 
â€œ little and little, by reafon of that terror in their confciences, were glad to manu- 
â€œ mit all their villeins.
But the faid holy fathers, with the abbots and priors, did 
â€œ not in like fort by theirs; for they alfo had a fcruple in confcience to impoverifh 
Â« and defpoil the church fo much, as to manumit fuch as were bond to their 
â€œ churches, or the manors which the church had gotten ; and fo kept their villeins 
â€œ ftill.â€ So great was the bondage of the villeins, in the reign of King Richard II.
that the Commons petitioned, â€œ That no v illein of any bifhop, or other religious 
â€œ perfon, fhould purchafe any land, on pain of forfeiting the fame to the king; 
" and that no villeins do put their children to fcbool /â€™ fo that by their ignorance they 
fhould not afpire above bondage, but remain no better informed than brutes.* 
This county, as has been obferved before, abounds in cuftomary manors : fome 
of which have heriots , boon fervices in the chace, ploughing, making hay, reaping, 
Â£cc.
various rents , as coals, corn, &c.
and on death of lord or tenant, or alienation 
of the lands, fines arbitrary , fines certain , &c.
as will be fhewn in each refpective 
manor.
Thefe bafe tenures greatly retard cultivation, and the improvement of 
eftates : for the miferable tenant, who is to pay an arbitrary fine and a heriot , is 
perpetually impeverifhed ; preluming the arbitrary fine to be two yearâ€™s rent, it may 
happen, that the land may be fubjedt to two fines in one year; by death of tenant 
and lord ; and the event muft fweep away four yearâ€™s value, together with a cow, 
a horfe, or other his beft beaft ; what has the unhappy heir to poftefs?
he ftands 
forth incumbered with debt, and has the fhackles of adverfity and misfortune on 
his hands for life: his tenement (as many are) not above ten pounds a-year, lies 
unimproved ; bred to a rural life, he cannot betake himfelf from an indolent habit, 
tn manufactory and labour; but he finks down to old age, through a ftate of ab- 
jectnefs and inutility.
It would be greatly to the advantage of the ftate at large, 
and of the lords of thefe manors feverally, to enfranchife the tenants, as fome of 
them here have done : many parts of this county is capable of high improvement; 
and the utmoft encouragement ought to be given to it.

which extinguifhed 
knightâ€™s fervice, declares in the 4th fedlion, " That all fines for alienations, &c.
â€œ and all charges incident and arifing for, or by reafon of wardfhip, &c.
or tenure 
â€œ of knight's fervice, and other charges incident thereto, are taken away and dif- 
â€œ charged, any law, ftatute, or ufage, to the contrary notwithftanding.â€ And by 
<( the 5th fedtion, â€œ All tenures by knightâ€™s fervice of the king, or of any other 
â€œ perfon, and the fruits and confequences thereof be taken away and difcharged, 
â€œ any law, &c.
to the contrary notwithftanding ; and all tenures of any honours, 
<c manors, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or an eftate of any inheritance at the 
** common law, held either of the king, or of any other perlon or perfons, are 
cc turned into free and common focage.â€ â€” There are three provijoes in this law, on 
which the bafe tenures in Cumberland , muft inevitably ftand or fall.
Th tfirji is, 
that this adt ftiould not take away rents certain, heriots, or fuits of court, belonging 
or incident to any former tenure, thereby taken away or altered, to grow due to 
the king or any mean lords.
The fecond is, that fines for alienation, due by particular cuftoms fiiall not be 
taken away.
The third is, that it fhall not alter or change any tenure, by copy of court-roll, 
or any fervice incident thereto.
By thefe provijoes only, the arbitrary fines on the cuftomary tenures are to be 
fupported : and to that end it feems to be incumbent, to prove that they Jubfifted , 
and were ejlablijhed preceding the year 1660, when the law was made , and it is greatly 
to be queftioned, whether that proof could any where be found ; and, indeed, it is 
totally inconfiftent with this benevolent ftatute, that it fhould ever be left in the 
power of an infolent lord, who had, perhaps, entertained an unjuft averfion to his 
tenant, or being of an avaricious mind, in his want of the common feelings of 
humanity, to impofea fine beyond the ability of his tenant, or even the value of the 
land ; however that power may be reftrained by fubfequent laws.
It would be an 
adt of great benevclence in the man, who Ihould point out the general mode of dif- 
Jolving thofe bafe tenures, and lead on a meafure for the enfranchijement of the 
whole race of cuftomary and copyhold tenants.
Lelandâ€™s Boundaries of this County, in his Itinerary, vol.
vii.
fol.
71, is worthy 
of attention : â€œ The lenght of Cumbreland by the fhore is, from a water cawled 
ff Dudden, the which devideth Furnefland fro Cumbreland onto a lythe water or 
" mere cawled Polt-rofe, the which devideth the cownte of Northumberland, on 
tc the eft fide, from Cumbreland.â€ 
Â« The bredeth of Cumbreland is, from a water cawled Emot, that devideth on

INTRODUCTION.
We cannot clofe this Introdutflion to our Hiftory better, than by fubjoining to 
the foregoing extract from Leland, the following quaint defcription of the county 
from Speed; and fome remarkable lines from Drayton.
â€œ The forme of this countie is long and narrow, pointing wedge-like into the 
â€œfouth: which part is altogether peflered with copped hills, and therefore hath 
the name of Copland.
The middle is more level, and better inhabited; yielding 
â€œ fufficient tor the fuftenance of man : but the north is wild and folitarie, and 
** combred with hilles, as Copland is.
â€œ The air is piercing, and of a lharp temperature, and would be more biting, 
f< were it not that thofe high hilles breake off the northern ftormcs, and cold 
â€œ falling fnows.
â€œ Notwithflanding, rich is this province, and with great varieties of commo- 
â€œ dieties is replenifhed : the hilles, though rough, yet Imile upon their beholders, 
â€œ fpread with ffieep and cattle, the vallies ftored with grafle and corne fufficient: 
â€œ the fea affordeth great ftore of fifli, and the land is overfpread with great varietic 
â€œ of fowles.
â€œ Many memorable antiquities remaine and have been found in this county: for 
" it being the confines of the Romanâ€™s pofleffions, was continually fecured by their 
" garnfons; and in many places their ruines remaine, with altars and infcriptions 
<f of their captaines and colonies, whereof many have been found, and more as

HISTORY OF CUMBERLAND.
OF CUMBERLAND IN GENERAL.
M ANY of the manufcripts and other materials, from whence the Hijlory of 
Northumberland was compiled, comprehending confiderable matter relative 
to the county of Cumberland, the author was induced to continue his tour; and, 
in order to connedt the hiflories of the two counties, vve fhall purfue our courfe 
along the Pidts wall, from Glenwhelt.
In the Introduction, a fhort view is taken of the laws and cuftoms of our 
Britifh and Saxon anceftors, and fuch hiftorical fadts as relate to this county at 
large, are briefly recounted : we fhall now proceed to the hiftory and defcription 
of each particular diftridt and place: firft premifing, that â€” 
â€” The etymology of the name Cumberland Camden gives,* from the Saxon 
Irumbjiolan'o, or Dumej\larvo, derived from the Britons called Kimbri and Kambri , who 
held pofleflion of this territory, with the greatefl: fortitude, againfl: the Saxon 
arms.f 
Cumberland runs out to a narrow point on the fouth, where it is " divided from 
** Furnejs , which is a partj of the county of Lancafter , by the river Dudden, which 
â€œ falls into the Irifh fea at Milium cafile.â€ The boundary of this county thence 
is defcribed to proceed, c< by the banks of that river up to Ulfay t or Woolf.

f To fupport this etymology, the learned author quotes Marianus, who gives this county the appella- 
tion of Terra Cumhrorum.
The names of mountains and rivers fuffer little corruption in the courfe of 
ages, thence, we find the names of many places in the north evidently derived from the Britijh language ; 
as Pen-roeth, Pen-rodoc, Caer-luel, Caerdronoc, and others, It is the opinion of a learned writer, that 
the name of this county was derived from our Englifh Cumber , with relation to the lakes and mountains 
that encumber it; and make it difficult for travellers to pafs.jj

BARONY OF GILSLAND.

Camdenâ€™s defcription of the general face of this county, is not ill adapted to its 
prefent Rate.
â€œ Though the northern fituation renders the country cold, and the 
Â«Â« mountains are rugged and uneven, yet it has a variety, which affords a very 
agreeable profpedt; for after fu elling rocks and crowding mountains, big as it 
â€œ were with metals, (between w r hich are lakes ftored with all forts of wild fowl) 
â€œ you come to rich hills, cloathed with flocks of (beep; and below thofe are fpread 
Â«Â« out, pleafant large plains, tolerably fruitful.
The ocean alfo which breaks upon 
" this lhore, affords great: plenty of the beft: fifh, and, as it were, upbraids the 
â€œ inhabitants for their idlenefs, in not applying themfelves to the filhing trade.â€ 
The banks of Eden afford many beautiful and rich inclofures ; improvements have 
made a rapid pace there, and in the environs of Netherby , within the prefent 
century; the lands near Penrith are well cultivated, and around IVigton is an 
extenlive plain, properly fenced and kept in good hufbandry: in the vale of Lorton 
and near to Cockervmuth the lands are excellent; but many other parts of the county 
conlift of large and irregular fwells, which, towards the fea, extend their fkirts 
even to the very fhores.
The interior parts are crowded with rugged and ftu- 
pendous mountains, around whofe bafes pretty vales are fcattered.
Little corn is 
produced, except in the low lands and vallies ; the climate and nature of the foils 
being beff adapted to grazing ; the mountains afford excellent fheep walks.
A 
hilly country gives innumerable changes of landfcape; and in this, in particular, 
fuch variety of enchanting and romantic feenes are to be found, as, perhaps, few 
parts of Europe, within a like com pafs, can boaft.
The climate of this part of the 
ifland is cold, from its vicinity to the ocean, and on account of that current of air 
which follows the channel of the lrifh fea; but it is healthful and invigorating; 
and the inhabitants are remarkable for their Rature, ftrength, and beauty.^ 
BARONY OF GILSLAND.
The part of Cumberland where we entered from Northumberland, is called the 
barony of Gililand,* of w-hich Camden fays, f< A tracR, fo cut and mangled with 
â€œ the brooks, or fo full of rivulets, that 1 fhould fuppofe it to have taken its name 
<f from 
â€œ William Gilpin, Efq. of Scaleby caftle, from whofe copy this was taken, fays, that the original is 
â€œ left imperfeCt in many places, with large blanks, and the whole confufed and without order; fo that 
â€œ it leemed to have been only a collection of materials, which he intended afterwards to have difpofed in 
â€œ better form.â€ 
â€œ Mr. Gilpin firft undertook to place the greater baronies in order, and to reduce the places, under 
â€œ their refpedtive baronies; he has likewile made fome ufeful additions and annotations, and continued 
â€œthe pedigrees of feveral families down to the year 1687; among many copies I have feen, his is 
â€œ much the beft.â€ Mr. Milbourneâ€™s Note prefacing the MS.

Â§ â€œ It is to be obferved, that in the account of the lords of Gilffand, the chronicles differ vey much ;

â€œ In this family it continued till the death of the latt male heir, George Lord

Â« In the partition of the ettate, this fell to Elizabeth, married to Lord William

" ttill continues.
â€ft Having prefented to the reader a tranfcript of what is faid 
by Camden and his learned editors, we will purfue the manufcript before us.
â€œ This 
â€œ great barony was given, by the Earl Ranulph Mefchines, to one Hubertus, to 
â€œ be holden of him by two knights fees and cornage; he was called De Dallibus t 
* < or Vaulx, from the dales or Vallies, whereof that country is full.
The French 
Â« word Vaulx (pronounced Vaux) becaufe thence a furname to him and his pof- 
Â«* terity there, and to divers other families, that took their beginning from the 
â€œ younger brothers of this houfe ; as Vaux of Triermaine, of Ainftaplygh, of 
" Caterlen and Caldbeck, &c.
â€œ Hubertus was a kinfman or a follower of the faid Earl Randolph, in the 
â€œ latter end of the conquerorâ€™s time, when the peace of the county began to be 
" ettablifhed, and ferved under the earlâ€™s brother, William Mefchines in 
â€œ Gilfland,â€ 
" King Henry confirmed this barony unto the faid Hubert, t to be holden of the 
" crown in capite, when the Earl Randolph refigned the county of Cumberland 
â€œ to the king, and obtained the earldom of Chcfter, after the death of Richard, the 
â€¢â€¢ fecond Earl of Chetter, who with the faid kingâ€™s children, coming out of Nor- 
â€œ mandy, was drowned on the coaft of England; to which Richard, the Earl 
Â«* Randolph was next heir, and coufin-german, the fon of John Bohun, by his wife 
â€œ Margaret, rhe fitter of Hugh Lupus, the firft Earl of Chetter.â€ 
â€œ The faid Hubert did bear to his arms, cheque dâ€™or and gules: his feal w T as a 
" griphon eating a lacerr.
â€œ his wife, filler to Hugh Lupus, firft earl of Chefter.
Again William de Mefchines, brorherto Ranulph 
â€œ de Mefchines, was lord of Coupland, but not of Gilfland; for upon Randolph's refignation of the county 
â€œ of Cumberland, into the hands of King Henry I.
Randolph had given Gilfland to Hubert de Vallibus,

â€œ After he was peaceably poflefled of the barony, he gave divers portions there - 
c * of by the name of manors, and other lands ; fome to the ancient inhabitants, and 
<f others to his friends and kinfmen, and fuch as he fo preferred, to be bound by 
â€œ alliance and marriage to his houfe, and by all other fuch good offices as he 
â€œ could devife.
â€œ He gave Denton, in Gilfland, to one Wefcop, by deed of feofment, thus

â€œ Hubertus de Vallibus Sal.
&c.â€ which ferves to prove his antiquity, and what peo- 
u pie did then, or late before, inhabit that country.
â€œ Hubert de Vallibus had tw'o brothers, Robert de Dalfton and Reginald de 
â€œ Soureby; to this Reginald he gave Carlatton , in Gilfland, and Heverby , near to 
â€œ Carlifle ; which gift Randolph Mefchines confirmed.
i( He gave alfo Fay lan to one Weftfarlan, and Chorkby to one Odard, and divers 
cc other manors and lands in Gilfland, partly to his followers, and partly to the an- 
** cient inhabitants, to bind them more firmly to his intereft; yet they continued 
â€œ but a fhort time his friends, for in King Stephenâ€™s time, when the Scots, under 
<f their King David, and Earl Henry Fitz David, pofTeffed the county of Cumber- 
if land, they flood with the ancient heir, one Gilles Bueth, againft Hubertâ€™s title to 
â€œ Gilfland.
e< I read of one Bueth, a Cumberland man, about the time of the conquefl: he 
*' built Buecaftle, and was lord of Buecaftle dale: his fon Gilles Bueth, had or 
â€œ pretended a right to all, or part of the barony of Gilfland, at leafl to that part 
" thereof, wffiich adjoineth to Buecaftle.
He was kinfman to the ancient lordâ€™s of 
â€œ Burgh barony, which were before the conquefl, either by confanguimty or affinity.
f< This Gilles Bueth, and Bueth his father, it is faid, flood with Hubert de Val- 
â€œ libus, and before him, with William Mefchines, when he lay there in garrifon, 
" by command of his brother, Earl Randolph in the conquerorâ€™s time: the father 
â€œ Bueth being then a follower of Gofpatric the great.* â€” But attempting fome thing 
â€œ afterwards for the recovery of his ancient right , of which it feems he was difpofttfed, 
** or upon fome other difconlent , he was banifhed.
f And though the regifter book of 
* f Abbey Lanercofl reports, his fon Gilles Bueth, w ho is there called Gil-fil Bueth, 
Â«* to be lord of Gilfland, yet he never poirdfed a foot therein, for he w r as an infant 
â€œ at the time of his fatherâ€™s banifhment, and was afterwards feated in Scotland, 
â€œ where he dwelt, till he vvas flain; as afterwards is noted.
His children and 
â€œ poflerity in Scotland were called of his name Gilles Bueth, or lairds of Gillef- 
Â« bueth, corruptly Gillefbies, or lairds of Gillefby, of the place where he dwelt, 
â€œ which was fo called, becaufe he firlE built there.
Â« Being thus difinherited and malecontent, he wafted the country ;Â§ and in King 
â€œ Stephen's time , when the Scots were let into Cumberland , he took that opportunity to 
Â«* incite as many as he could y to affift him to recover his eft ale in Gilfland from Hubert

â€œ office of Lord Chief Jufiice of England, in the twenty-fixth year of that reign ; 
<l when Richard became a monk in the abbey of Lenos, or Weftwood ; refigning 
â€œ that office for age and debility.
Robert de Vallibus was of fo much account with 
â€œ King Henry II.
that he did little in Cumberland, without Robertâ€™s advice and 
<f counfel : yet could not his confcience be at quiet, until he made atonement for 
â€œ the murder of Gilles Bueth, by endowing holy church, with part of that patri- 
â€œ mony, which occafioned the murder,- and therefore he founded the priory of

THE 
PARISH OF LANERCOST.
T HIS parifh is of large extent, being bounded by Haltwhiftle on the eaft, the 
two Dentons on the foutheaft, Walton on the weft, Stapleton on the north- 
weft, Brampton on the fouth, and fouthweft, and Bewcaftle on the north.
The pariih is divided into four quarters, viz.
Burtholme, Waterhead, Kingâ€™s 
Water, and Afkerton ; and each quarter maintains its own poor.
It comprehends 
five conftablewicks, viz.
Banks, Burtholme, Afkerton, Waterhead, and Kingâ€™s 
Water.
There are four manors within this parifh, Lanercoft, Walton-Wood, Trodder- 
maine or Tryermaine, and Afkerton: the manor of Lanercoft has in it, about 
thirteen freeholders, and fixty cuftomary tenants.
The manors of Walton-Wood, 
Troddermaine, and Afkerton, are within the cuftom of the barony of Gilfland; 
and pay an arbitrary fine of two yearâ€™s value on the death of the tenant, or on an 
alienation, and a twenty-penny fine certain on the death of the lord.
They do 
fuit at the lordâ€™s court; and the lord claims all the wood, except the hedge-rows.
The villages in the parifh are Burtholme, Wefthall Moorguards, Sogdlin, and 
Kirkcambeck, (formerly a parifh of itfelf, but now incorporated with the parifh of 
Lanercoft) lying within that quarter of the parifh called Afkerton, 
We approached the venerable remains of 
LANERCOST PRIORY.
The vale in which the abbey and remains of the monaftery are fituated, takes its 
name from the dedication of the church, and is called St. Maryâ€™s Holme.
The 
land is fertile, and the vale is fliut in onevery fide by lofty hills, fome cloathed with 
wood, and others divided into fine inclofures: the river Irthing flow'ing through 
the valley in meanders: the whole feene is beautiful, folemn and majeftic.
The 
approach to the remains, is by a ftone bridge of two elliptic arches.
Some parts 
of the monaftic buildings are converted into a farm houfe, fo that it is not 
poftible, at this time, to diftinguifh the particular offices of the religious houfe.
The chief part of the monaftery was repaired in the fixteenth century, for the 
manfion of one of the Dacres, and yet retains the old (lately projecting centre 
window of the convent.
Part of the cemetery grounds have been converted 
into gardens, which approach dole to the walls of the abbey, on the fouth; and 
feveral ftone coffins and inferibed monuments lie among the trees.
We entered the church, which is in the form of a crofs, at the weft door: the 
gateway confifts of a circular arch of many members, richly ornamented and fup- 
ported on piiafters, the capitals and bafes of which are without any other embel- 
liffiments than plain rolls.
In a nich, above the entrance, is a ftatue of Mary 
Magdalen, of excellent workmanfliip, in ftone.
The figure is fomewhat mutilated, 
but the drapery is elegantly difpofed, On the right hand is a diminutive figure

The canopy of the nich is circular, fupported on pilafters, 
ornamented with the heads of cherubs.
This part of the edifice, has, of late years 
been put in repair; it is fitted up in a plain and decent manner for divine fer- 
vice, being the parochial church of the panfh of Lanercoft, and capable of con- 
taining a great number of people.
On the right of the communion table, is a tablet fixed in the wall, with this 
infeription: â€”

In the great window, above the communion table, is the following infeription, 
faid to be removed from the window of the hall, now uled as a barn: â€” 
â€œ Mille et quingentos ad quinquaginta novemq.

The walls of the other parts of the church, and the centre tower, are ftanding, 
but unroofed.
The crofs aile is thirty-two paces in length, and the quire tw r enty-fix.
The 
tower has formed a Ipacious cupola, each corner fupported by a cluftered pillar, 
light, and well proportioned.
An open gallery or colonade runs round the upper 
part of the whole edifice, fupported on fingle pillars, without any dead fpace or 
interval, â€” a circumftance uncommon in fuch buildings, and which gives a light 
and beautiful appearance to this.
The arches of the gallery are pointed, but the 
principal ones of the building are circular: though moft of the windows are 
lancet under pointed arches.
The tower is low and heavy, without ornament, 
except an embrazured battlement.
The ceiling of the cupola is of wood work, 
but retains no efcutchions of arms, or other decorations.
The quire is lighted to 
the eaft, by three long lancet windows below, and an equal number above, and two 
Windows on each fide.
The whole ftrudlure is plain, of excellent mafonry, and 
conftrudkd of a durable ftone.
At each end of the crofs aile, are feveral tombs 
richly fculptured with the arms of the Howards and Dacres; from their expofure, 
the inferiptions are obliterated, the ornaments defaced, and the whole grown green 
with mofs.
The veneration for anceftors, in former ages, was an incitement to 
| Which may be read thus â€” Robertus de Vallibus, fon of the Lord of Gilfland, founder of the priory 
of Lanercoft, in the year of our Lord 1 1 16, Edargyne his wife having no iflue.
By this date, the monaftery was founded fifty-three years before the dedication of the church: this is 
not much to be wondred at when we confider the ftate of the borders in the reign of King Stephen.
* Which may be read thus â€” To one thoufand five hundred add fifty and nine, and in that year Thom as 
Dacre, Knight, ereiSted this work.
He was the firft who came to this feat, after the diflolution of the

It was given to him by Edward, though before promifed by Henry, as a reward for his long

We were told by an old perfon who lived near the abbey, that fome years ago, 
one of the fepulchral vaults fell in, which excited his curiofity to view the remains 
depoiited there, where he found fevcral bodies entire ; one in particular with a

The patronage of the priory was granted, very early, to the ecclefiaftical body.
By the manufeript chronical of Lanercoft, depofited in the Britifh Mufeum, it 
appears, that Henry de Burgh was prior here, and died in the year j 3 1 5 .
It is therein 
faid that he was a famous poet ; but no part of his works are now extant.
Pie 
was fucceeded by Robert de Meburn , chofen by the convent, and confirmed by the 
bifhop of the diocefe.
William de Southayke was next, and died in 1337, when 
John de Bozve/hby was in like manner chofen.
The next fucceffor was John de 
Bothecajlre ; but he, on account of old age and infirmities, refigned, and had aftigned 
him a cell in the convent for life.
Thomas de HextoldefbamÂ§ w as elected in his place, 
who, befides the oath ot canonical obedience, was obliged by the bifhop to make a 
folemn promife, â€œ A ot to frequent public huntings, or to keep fo laige a pack of hounds

of a prior; one party being in favour of Richard de Rydal, a canon of Carlifle, 
and the other for John de Menyngton, a cannon of the houfe : on an appeal heard at 
the bifhopâ€™s caftle of Rofe, Rydal was confirmed.
|J 
In the year 1360, the prior abfenting himfelf, the bifhop conftituted Martin de 
Brampton , one of the canons, guardian of the houfe.
It is remarkable that in all 
the repofitories we have had accefs to, we have not found an account of the fuc- 
cefiion of priors from the above period.

ted to the crown, under the grant of King Henry VIII.
and is now in the tenure of 
the prefent Earl of Carlifle, who holds a court baron and cuftomary court.
The 
cuffomary lands pay a certain fine on admittance of a tenant, or change of lord, 
without any heriots or other fervices.
The widowâ€™s right is one full third part for 
life, or during her viduity, of the tenements of which her hulband died feized.
This cuffomary tenure is of a mixed nature, and partakes of freehold, the lands 
palling in alienation by deed, which is confirmed by the lordâ€™s admitting to the 
roll of tenants in court : the lands will alio pafs by furrender in court and admit- 
tance.
There is an ancient referved rent payable annually out of each tenement to 
the lord, on which each fine is computed, viz.
every penny of the ancient or re- 
ferved rent is multiplied by twenty, which gives the accepted term of a twenty- 
penny fine, payable by the cuffomary tenants of this manor.

Lancrcoft is, at prefent, no more than a perpetual curacy, was certified to the 
crovemors of Queen Anneâ€™s bounty at 14I 5s.
and hath received one allotment of 
200I.
The Earl of Carlifle is patron.* 
The public were indebted to George Smith, Efq. a correfpondcnt of the editor 
of the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, for the publication of the two following curious in- 
kriptions difcovered at Lanercoft, and firfl: publifhed in the 14th vol.
of that 
valuable repofitory, p.
369.!
Â« The following Roman infcription, being the head flone of the upper pafiage, 
** betwixt the pillars and out- wall of the old abbey of Lanercofi, has efcaped the 
* Aspect.] The general afpett is towards the fouth: 
Soil and Produce.] The foil is various: in the vale of St. Maryâ€™s Holme, the foil is chiefly loarrij 
with a mixture of fand, and is very fruitful.
The bank-lands, lying upon a limeftone, produce every kind 
of grain; but the cultivation, by reafon of the fteep declivities, is laborious.
Further up the river Irthing 
the foil is colder and more barren.
Some timber trees and much brufhwood cloath the borders of the 
river.
Kingfvvater quarter lies to the northeaft: the valley is Unit in on each fide by fteep hills of com- 
mon or wafte lands, and is of a ftrong fruitful foil producing,, good corn.
The average rent of inclofed 
ground is about fifteen fhillings, fome lands let for thirty (Hillings per acre.
The extenlive common- 
right is certainly of confiderable value..
Common Lands and Cattle.] The waftes and common lands are very extenfive and afford pafturage 
for a great number of cattle: Lord Carlifleâ€™s farms have a valuable priviledge, in the maintenance of large 
llocks, as well thofe bred there, as thofe brought from Scotland: the breed is of the Scotch kind, both in 
black cattle and horfes, and are generally fold off at two or three years old.
Near one thoufand head of 
black cattle are bought yearly, and brought on to the common lands in October or November, and are fold 
again to the graziers from Leicefttrfhire, Lincolnfhire, &c.
at Brough-hill fair the laft day of September 
and fiift of O&ober, in the fucceeding year with an advantage of about twenty (hillings a head, upon an 
average.
Sheep.] The fheep ftocks are fmall, on account of the wetnefs of the wafte grounds: wool, in the laft 
year fold from eight (hillings to twelve (hillings a (lone of 1 61 b.
â€” The fleeces of (heep that depafture on 
the heights are not fo valuable.
Market.] The chief market for the ordinary neceffaries of life is at Brampton, diftant two miles.
Fuel.] In the northern parts peat and turf, in other parts coal from Tindalefell, diftant about fix miles.
Game.] There is much game, particularly groufe.
Juniper.] It grows here, in fpots of barren foils, compofed of clay and cankering gravel, which 
hardly admits of any other vegetation: and we do not know that it grows any where elfe in the 
county.
Housmanâ€™s Notes.
Population.] The numherof families within this parifti (including Kirkcambeck) amount to about 
300, 26 are Prefbyterians, 2 Quakers: â€” the inhabitants are nearly I400H 
We acknowledge ouifelves greatly indebted to the Rev. George Gilbanks, for much information 
touching this parifh: and alfo to the Rev. Jonathan Boucher, for his biographical notes, and other 
valuable contributions to this work.
f George Smith, tfq.
was a native of Scotland; a man of genius and learning; but of an affirming 
..;r, irritable temper, and fufpicious principles as to religion.
After being fome time an afiiftant in fame 
faninary of learning, in or near London, he lived with and affifted Dr. Defagulier in his philofophical ex- 
periments.
Marrying foon after, he engaged in an academy at Wakefield, afterwards lived near Brampton; 
and finally fettled at Wigton, where he lived on a fmall annuity, but from what fource it was derived, was 
never known.
He inftrudfed feveral perfons in that neighbourhood in Mathematics and philofophy, and 
was a great contributor to the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine.
Both he and his wife died at Wigton.
He had 
the merit of exciting, in that neighbourhood, a very general attention to literature^; and the demerit of 
promoting a fpirit of fufpicion and infidelity.
He had a daughter, Mrs. Sarah Smith, who, for fome 
time, was a preacher among the Quakers.

Cohorsprimae /Elias Dacorum, cui praeeft 
â€œ Julius Saturninus Tribunus.
The reft has been obliterated by the 
workmen, at building the abbey.
To underftand it, we are to con- 
ct fider, that, befides the legionary troops employed in the Roman 
â€œ fervice, there were ten auxiliary cohorts, which made a legion of 
â€œ foreign troops, and aflumed the name of the conquered province 
<c to which they belonged, and fometimes added another title, in 
<f honour of fome of their emperors, under whom they were probably 
Â£5 TfYldW'** inlifted.
This cohort was then called JElia Dacica,* /Elia in ho- 
VRKV/ â€œ nour of Hadrian, who was ftiled Titus .Elius Hadrianus, and 
1 â€œ Dacica from their country.
Dacia comprehended all that tracl of 
l VJY / cc ground north of the Danube to the Carpathian mountains, betwixt 
** the rivers Tibifbifcus and Pruth, comprehending now partof Hun- 
" gary, Tranfylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia.
We have many 
â€œ other ftones which mention this cohort, particularly at Burdofwald, 
<( the Roman Amboglana; here the Notitia, that was written under 
ct Theodofius, junior, places this legion, which feems to have fucceeded the legio 
â€œ fexta viftrix, and very likely garrifoned this place, to the final departure of the 
â€œ Romans from Britain.
The name of the tribune is different from that on any 
" other of the ftones afcribed to this cohort.
u Whilft I was copying this ftone, thefarmerâ€™s fon who refides atthe abbey, told me 
Â«* there were fome kind of letters, over a ftaircafe in an old tower, belonging to their 
Â« houfe which excited my curiofity.
I found it a piece of as valuable infcription

Â«Â« method of writing in that obfcure century, renders it very remarkable ; for in 
â€œ the fingle word triccntejimo it is difficult to fay to which alphabet the letter T 
â€œ belongs ; but it moftly refembles the Celto-Scythic.
R is Roman, E is Runic, 
ct M the old Gothic ; and in other words, fome are Saxon.
â€œ The Roman wall, which pafles jufl: above it, has furnifhed the principal ma- 
â€œ terials for this edifice.â€ 
]n this parifh is that famous medicinal fpring, belt known to the public by the 
name of Wardrew Spa, near to Shaws, on the banks of the river Irthing.
It 
breaks forth at the foot of a rock pretty fluently ; and from the virtues of the water, 
anciently obtained the name of Holywell, having had the benediction of fome re- 
ligious perfon of note for his fancflity.
The editors of Camden fay, the waters are 
impregnated with fulphur, nitre, and vitriol, and are good for the fpleen, the ftone, 
and all cutaneous diftempers ; but the authority for that analylis, is not given* 
Dr. Todd fays, the water is deeply impregnated with fulphureous and faline parti- 
cles, and on that account has a cathartic and emetic virtue : Dr. Short clafles it 
among the fulphureous waters, and fays it contains a very confiderable portion oÂ£ 
fulphur, a fmall quantity of fea fait, and very little earth : the place is greatly re- 
forted to in the fummer feafon ; but it feems to us not at all calculated for a place 
of recreation and amufement, fituated in a deep retirement, furrounded by uncul- 
tivated eminences, covered w ith heath ; the vale narrow, and (hut up from thofe 
pifturefque fcenes, which are difpofed at fome little diftance, near to Lanercofl 
and Naworth : the air is often found heavy, by the vapours and gloom which too 
frequently obfcure the fky, and impend on the brows of the mountains.
The 
place is well fuited to the reception of thofe, w'ho really feek the benefit of the 
waters; being a ftill and folemn retreat.
Good accommodations render it a de- 
ferable feat of fecluflon for the invalid.
ROMAN WORKS.
The flation of Carr-Voran , f the magna of the Romans, feated on the extreme 
boundary of Northumberland, was defcribed in our former publication.
* From 
thence tve now take our progrefs along the wâ€™orks of Hadrian and Severus.
The Roman military road, called the Maiden Way, which we obferved entered 
Northumberland near Whitley caftle, pafles through Carr-Voran, and extends along 
the northern part of this county, over the heights, to the eaft of Bewcaftle, Â£ in a 
direction almoft duly north, and enters Scotland near Lamyford, where it crofies 
the river Kirkfop.
The Roman road which leads from Walwick Cheflers in 
Northumberland, has lain in a dire&ion a little to the fouth of Carr-Voran, but 
leems to terminate in the fuburbs, the traces of it not being difcovered beyond the 
fort.
At the time Mr. Warburton and Mr. Horfley vifited this country, they 
ipeak of it, as being â€œ very vifible upon the moor loutheafl, and not far from Carr- 
Voran:â€ but the great turnpike road, lately made by the dire&ion of government,

has fallen upon it in feveral places, and in many parts has greatly defaced the 
remains.
The praetenturae of Severus and Hadrian, with their ditches, are very confpicu- 
ous from Carr-Voran down to the river Tippal, which flows at the foot of the 
eminence : notwithftanding the country people are incefiantly robbing Severusâ€™s 
â– wall for materials to build, and other purpofes ; yet under the force of fo many ages, 
and fuch endeavours to deftroy the work, through the hardnefs of the cement, great 
remains ftill appear: fome tiers of the outfide cafings are in many places ftanding, 
and where thofe are removed, the infide filling ftones fhew themfelves laid in an 
inclining pofition,asclofeas their natural furfaces will admit, and run full of mortar.
This mode of building is excellent, as a wall of that conftrudion is nearly as folid 
in the centre, as any other part ; and by the polition of the ftones, is admirably 
linked and bound together.
Both Severusâ€™s wall and Hadrianâ€™s vallum leave the 
caftle of Thirlwall to the north.
According to the before-mentioned authors, Â§ 
it was " here, as a tradition fays, that the Scots and Pidts broke through the wall : 
* r but the caftle might be fo called, from the paflage of the river through the wall.â€ 
As we continued to travel, with the works of thofe two learned authors before us, 
(having done the fame in Northumberland) we carefully obferved the feveral fix- 
ations of the ancient works they noted, to gain from thence, if poflible, the argu- 
ments which led them to their determinations, and which they have been pleafed 
to omit in their publications.
Here it was evident to us, that the ftation of Carr- 
Voran, of fuch peculiar ftrength, placed on an eminence immediately commanding 
that part of the wall, where it is fuppofed a breach was made, by the northern nations, 
within the reach of their miflile weapons and engines, muft have been evacuated, 
before fuch breach could be effected ; and confequently we are inclined to think, 
the name of Thirlwall, or through the wall, was not derived from any fuch event, 
but was occafioned by the fluice or bridge where the river pafled through the works.
Thirl is a name of common acceptation in the north, for an opening left in moor 
fences, for fneep to pafs to and from the commons adjacent to inclofed grounds.
A little further weft, are the vifibl-e remains of a caftellum, within which an 
edifice now ftands, called the chapel ; but how it gained that appellation we could 
not learn.
At this point all the works are particularly diftind and plain ; the 
walls are diftant from each other about five chains ; at a little place called Fowlton, 
the military way re not to be traced, but Severusâ€™s wall is diftinguifhable, and, in 
fome parts, the ditch; yet where the works lie through a trad which has long 
been cultivated, they are more and more defaced, and rendered difficult to be traced.
The wall and earth fence afterwards run out to a greater diftance from each other, 
nearly to the length of fix chains.
We obferved here, the work which the learned authors point out, being a vaft 
agger on the north brink of Severusâ€™s ditch.
Mr. Warburton fays, â€œ Whether it 
Is natural or artificial 1 know not.â€ To us it had all the appearance of art, as 
being calculated to enable afiailants to ufe their engines and miflile weapons with 
advantage, againft thofe who defended the wall.
We are told that the difpirited

Eskdale Ward.] 
Britons, forfaken of their allies, were dragged by hooks, from the fortifications 
they attempted, in vain, to defend, and were put to a miferable death.
We now palted over the little brook of Poltrofs, and entered 
THE COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND.
On the weft fide of the rivulet, are the remains of a caftellum : the walls of 
Severus and Hadrian, for fome diftance gradually incline to each other, and about 
a quarter of a mile further, they run within the length of a chain of each other, 
and continue much in the fame pofition, all the way to the brink of the river 
Irthing.
Near to the laft mentioned caftellum, Severusâ€™s wall having Ihot out to 
a more northern dire&ion, makes a quick turn to the fouthweft.
Mr. Warburton fays, â€œ At Willoford, on the eaft fide of the river, the military 
â€œ w r ay feemed to be fouth of both walls ; and at the head of the bank, on the weft 
Â«* fide, near Burdofwald, there feemed to be a military way on the north of them 
â€œ both, which was pretty vifible.
If the appearance be not miftaken, this is the 
â€œ only inftancc of Severusâ€™s military way running out between the two walls, in 
Â«* the whole track.â€ This defcription is quoted, becaufe, though the northern 
road is very difcernable, it is confefled we could not difcover the fouthern road ; 
and as our author, neither in his map or text, points out where he difcovered that 
it left the vallum of Hadrian, or where it joined it again, our refearches were dark 
as well as laborious.
It is obferved in the Northumberland tour, that where the maiden way came to 
the brink of a river, and was diftindtly to be traced on both fides, no remains of 
bridges w^ere found.
The great military road attending the w r all, where it ap- 
proached the rivers Irthing and Poltrofs, (hews no marks of having had a bridge 
at either place; the fhores were circumfpecftly examined, and no appearance of 
mafon work difcovered : if any bridges were ufed there, probably they were con- 
ftrucfted of W'ood, or were moveable platforms ; the banks of the Irthing are fteep, 
and the ftream frequently rapid ; the military way fetches a compafs, and goes 
with a Hope dow'n one fide, and rifes on the other, much in the fame form : but 
this might be, as well to gain an eafier palTage for carriages, as to approach a more 
fit part of the river for eroding it.
Near Thirlwall caftle, are the breaft-works fpoken of by Mr. Wallis, called the 
Black Dykes; where he fays, " Bullets have frequently been found.â€ This is the 
ground, on which Lord Hunfden v/ith the garrifon of Berwick, defeated Leonard 
Dacre, with 3000 of his retainers, when he took up arms againft the crown, after 
he had ufurped the pofleftions of the Dacres, on the deceafe of the laft of the male 
line, who died in infancy by the falling of his vaulting horfe.
The diftance from Carr-Voran to Burdofwald, by the line of the W'all, is two 
miles and three quarters : in this fpace three caftclla are vifible, at equal diftances, 
each interval containing juft fix furlongs and a half.
We approached 
BURDOSWALD.
It was â€œ in King Johnâ€™s time, and before, the freehold of Walter Bavin, William

With- 
in the ftation of Burdofwald this and the two following infcriptions are yet remaining, which all belong to 
the fame cohort with the preceding.
This is an imperfedt piece of an altar, the under part of which is 
broken off and loft.
It has been publifhed before by Mr Gordon, J but the two laft letters in the fecond 
and third lines are omitted by him.
Anio muft be the name, or part of the name, of fome perfon, who 
belonged to this cohort.
The name Anionius is in Gruter, $ but I will not fay that this has been the name 
here-

7. JOVL OPTIMO MAXIMO COHORS PlUMvE iELIiE DACORUM TETRICIANA 
ROMANA (VEL TETRICIANORUM) CUI PRiEEST PUBLIUS OLULICTIUS DE- 
SIGNATUS TRIBUNUS.
The fubftance of this infcription has been publifhed by Camden, ff but 
he neither deferibes the fhape of the altar, nor expreffes either the irregular order of the lines, or awkward, 
fhape of the letters.
Part of tlie commanderâ€™s name I could not well difeern.
Camden makes it Lutritiui or 
Luticius ; but to me it rather appeared to be P.
Oluliftius.
The altar is built up in the fore wall of a houfe, 
that Hands within the fort.
It has been eredted by the fame cohort, but under a different commander.
I know not well, whether to read the third line Petriciana Romana, or Petricianorum.
I fuppofe it to have 
taken this name from one of the Tetrici, who are among the thirty tyrants, and had a confiderable power 
in Britain, and whofe coins are alfo found here.
This fame cohort is called Gordiana in the very next 
number.
Such fort of Appellations are not unufual, and are defigned as compliments to thofe perfons from 
whofe names they are derived.
There is no doubc, therefore, but the cohort, by affuming this title, in- 
tended to exprefs thtir adherence to Tetricus.
So Pompeianus, Caefarianus, Galbianus, &c.
is ufed to 
fignify one who had efpoufed the intereft and party of Pompey, Caefar, Galba, fj&c.
This brings us 
down to the reign of the Emperor Gallienus, (after the middle of the third century) and fo may help 
us to fix the time and date of this fo odd an infcription, and which I fufpedl, has been cut by two or three 
different hands.
Mr. Ward chufes to read the third and fourth lines, â€œ Petricianorum cui praejl Polulius 
â€œ Romanui, and fuppofes the remaining letters of the word Romamu , or part of them, to have been on 
â€œ the fifth line, though now effaced.
Romanus is a name that very frequently occurs in Gruter, and we 
â€œ have it before in this colleefion.JU But the greateft difficulty feems to lie in the following word 
â€œ DE^IGNATVS, if taken in the ufual fenfe.
For a perfon was faid to be defignatus to any office be- 
â€œ tween the time of his being eledted, and his entering upon the execution of it; which donâ€™t fo well 
â€œ agree with the words cui pneef, that go before, and feem to intimate, that he had adtually the com- 
â€œ mand of the cohort at that time.
Defignatus., therefore, may probably be a third name of this 
â€œ officer.
And it appears from Gruter, who has this infcription, $ $ that Sir Robert Cotton was appre- 
u henlive of this difficulty; for referring to the word DESIGNATVS, he fubftitutes DESIDE RA- 
â€œ TVS, (a name which we find in another of his ir.fcriptions[| || ) as if the workman might polfibly have 
44 made a miftake; and he cites for it Cotton Shedtc .â€ However we have here plainly another tribune, 
and it is remarkable how each infcription appears to have been eredted at a different time and by a 
different commander.

Burdofwald is the firft Roman ftation on the way, which lay in our route.

This was likewife publifhed by 
Camden ; but as all the reft, without any draught of the ftone, or particular notice of the letters.-j- There 
is nothing very remarkable in this, only a new name of the prefect, and date of the infeription.
For if 
PETVO be a part of the Perpetuo, then this brings us to the year 237, according to the Fafti Confulares, 
though the cut of the letters feems rather too good for that age .

This is alfo of the fame nature with the preceding.
There are only the two letters IG remain- 
ing viiible in the name of the prefedt, but thefe are fufficient to Ihew it is different from all the others.
This 
inicription is upon a very' beautiful altar, that was Handing in the walk, with a fundial upon it.
â€” The 
letters having been fo long expofed to the w'eather, are now become very obfeure, though yet difcernable 
Thefe are the inferiptions that were publiftied long ago by Camden.
The few miftakes that are in his co- 
pies will eafily appear, by comparing them with what I have here publifhedfrom the originals.
The principal 
defedt was in their being expreffed only in Roman capitals, and no defeription of the ftones.
But thofe 
few which were publifhed in the additions to Camden, and are continued in the edition, 1722, (two of 
which at leaft are the fame with what Camden had publifhed before) are very much mifrep relented.
Several of the curious inferiptions that are in this garden, have been very fortunately preferved in a great 
meafure from the injuries of the weather by a laurel hedge, which grows againft a wall where they are 
placed.
But many of them have been long expofed to the weather, and fuffered greatly by that means.
This has rendered them obfeure and difficult to read, which has been the true reafon, I believe, why feve- 
ral of them have not been publifhed before.
And among thefe which have not yet been made public, 
I reckon the fix following.
12 VOTUM SOLVIT TRIBUNUS COHORTIS LIBENS MERITO.
This feems to belong to the fame cohort, (.Elia Dacorum) and to have been brought with the reft from 
Burdofwald.
But the firft and third lines are fo obfeure, that I canâ€™t offer at the reading.
Spon has given 
us two inferiptions, in which V.
S. for Votum folvit ftand in the fecondline; though indeed L.
M. for 
libens merito, immediately follow them in the fame line, and are not thrown to the end, as in the inferip- 
tion before us.
The two inferiptions in Spon are thefe following, f

DEO MARTI EMERITUS COHORTIS PRIMiE^LLE DACORUM CUI PRiEEST 
TRIBUNUS.
Drawn from the original in Mr. Morrit's mufeum.
The letters of this inferip- 
tion are rude and ill cut, and now become very obfeure.
But the ill fpelling,or corrupt way of writing, adds 
moll to the difficulty in reading it.
I believe it has been an altar eredted to Mars, by an emeritus of the 
fame Cohors JElia Dacorum, and by the remaining dark veftiges of the tribuneâ€™s name, who commanded 
it, he ftems to have been a different perfon from all that are mentioned in the other inferiptions.
The 
emeriti were old experienced foldiers, who, having ferved out their legal time, were, on any particular 
occafion invited into the army, and treated with marks of efteem.
On which account they were alfo 
exempted from labour and the common duties of foldiers, fuch as the watch, guard, &c.
They are fup- 
ooied to be much the fame with thofe who are ftiled evocati and beneficiarii.
14.
AMMIANUS VICTORIOUS TRIBUNUS.
Here is no more left than the name of thetri- 
bune, Ammunus V ictorinus, which is a different name from all the preceding ; yet I can't but think 
he was a commander of the fame Cohors JElia Dacorum.
15.
SOLI INVICTO Here are but few letters vifible, and even thofe which 
feem to appear, are not very plain and certain.
â€” There feems to be three prssfericula upon the top of the 
capital, which is very Angular.
As for the infeription, it is hard to forma probable conjedlure from fuch 
imperfeA remains.
However 1 fhall propofe the following, till a better offer itfelf.
I imagine then, that 
the altar may have been ercdled SOLI INVICTO, or DEO SOLI INVICTO, by the fame cohors 
prima ALlia Dacorum, under the command of fome tribune, whofe name is effaced.
I take the VS, in 
the third vifible line, to be part of the name of the tribune, and the laft line to coniift of the laft ftroke of 
an N and VS, making the laft fyllable in tribunus.
There appears fome affinity between this and the 
infeription on an altar at Scaleby ; where we meet with Soli invifto Sextus Severius Salvator.* Moft of the 
altars fretted by this cohort are to Jupiter optimus maximus ; but befides this exception, we had another 
tuft before DEO MARTI, and there is one altar inferibed to the local god Cocis , which is yet remain- 
ing at Scaleby.
f â€” The altar is in Mr. Morrit's mufeutn.
There was, befides all thefe, an half altar fet up for a gate-poft ; it was cut through the middle, from 
top to bottom, but not a letter to be feen upon it, though the face was entire.

There is yet another infeription among thofe which Camden 
himfelf copied at Willoford, or elfe at Burdofwald, and is thus, 
as he has deferibed it.J 
Before I had difeovered the original, 
I found it not eafy to understand the 
meaning of this infeription.
But the 
altar at Corby caftle, which, I hear, 
has been there, time immemorial, is, 
doubtlefs,that onwhich this infeription

yet be difeerned upon it.

" the notitia,and from feveral altars dedicated to Jupiter optimus maximus ,by the faid 
â€œ cohort, of which I fhall fubjoin the following, though almoft defaced by 
This 
I took the copy very carefully, and afterwards re-examined it with the ftridleft attention, and by comparing 
all thefe together, Camdenâ€™s infer iption will evidently appear to be the fame with the other, only he has 
taken the C at the end of the fecond line for an O, and obferving fome contradlions in the forgoing letters, 
has read them at length Maximiano.
But the two laft letters are plainly AC, and will admit of no other 
reading; but in this Mr. Gordon concurs.
The I has been included in the fecond M, though now not 
very difcernable; which is not uncommon in other inferiptions: fo that the word has been MAXIM for 
Maximi , and Camdenâ€™s reading vey much favours this.
And thus the fenfe runs very ealily and natu- 
rally for three or four of the full lines; Pro falute domini nojiri Maximi ac fortifimi imperatoris C afar is 
Marci Aureli Maximiani, &c.
The titles and eipthets in this infeription, are fuch as are ufually aferibed 
to Maximian; and the combinations of the letters very well fuit that age.
Camdenâ€™s V, in the fourth line, 
is plainly the middle part of the M with which it begins; and the other four letters, OAED, which he 
gives us at the end of the infeription, do alfo agree with our copy ; only he feems to have reprefented 
them as the laft, which they are not ; for IF follow, and arc very vifible, and being clofe both to the 
edge of the Hone and bottom of the plane, mull have been the laft letters in the infeription.
This looks 
like adificavity as the laft words in the preceding line do like exujhim; fo that poffibly it may have been 
templum exujlum a folo cedeficavit.
Mr. Ward thinks, â€œ HOC may have preceded, and fuppofes that 
â€œ appears like the firft V, in the fixth line, to be the middle part of a M, like Camdenâ€™s V in the line 
*â€¢ above.
There is room enough for PL; EX after it in the fame line.
And perhaps tire perfonâ€™s name, 
â€œ who built the temple, might be inferibed on the bafe.â€ I have annexed, under the fame number, a 
view of the head of the altar, the focus of which has a very peculiar figure, yet is not in full proportion, 
becaufe there was not room in the plate.

DEO COCIDI COHORS PR 1 MA iELIA DACORUM 
PR.diFECTUS VOTVM SOLVIT.
There is one infeription more, though now at 
Scaleby Caftle, upon which the cohort JElia Dacorum is plainly mentioned.
It has been publiftied in 
Camden, $ but as we are there told, it is uncertain where it was found, though I am of opinion it be- 
longed to this ftation.
It is an altar eredled to the local deity Cocis; but as I know nothing more of 
this deity, I have only to add, with refpedl to the infeription, that the letters are well cut, that the A in the 
laft line has been probably a part of PRAEF for prafeftus , and that the laft VS may be the ufual votum 
folvit.
It is curious to obferve the vaft number of inferiptions which have been found at this ftation, mention- 
ing the Cohort prima JElia Dacorum, and the different commanders, with the different dates arid-forms, 
which, upon t e whole, render the evidence of this being the ftation Amboglana exceeding clear and 
convincing.
Fcr there are no lefs than thirteen inferiptions, which make exprefs mention of this cohort, 
and nine different commanders, befides four others in which the fame cohort has, mod probably, been 
mentioned, though now the name be doubtful, or effaced.
To which I fhall only add this obfervation 
further, that the date perbetuo confide, which was in the year 236.
and the name Gordiana, which 
mull have been affumtd by the cohort about that time, or not long after it, fhew that they were at this 
place about the middle of the third century; and the name Tetiicianorum, with the mention of 
Maximâ€™anns, ftiew that they continued here till the beginning of the fourth.

CENTURIA CASSII PRISI COHORTIS SEXTiE POSUIT.
The other inferiptions 
which belong to the fet at Burdofwald, are moftly of the centurial fort, having been erefted either by the 
legions or cohorts, or elfe by the centuries or their centurions.
This and the next have not been taken no- 
tice of before.
This is on the fide of the door of the principal dwelling houfe in a fmall village, cal:ed Mur- 
ray, which is about a quarter of a mile eaft from Burdofwald.
It has been qredlcd by one CaJJius Prifcus, 
a centurion of the fi^th cohort, or by the century under his command, and 110 doubt, has been brought from

BURDOSVVALD, 
n 
This ftation, according to Mr. Warburtonâ€™s fcale and furvey, is marked number 
XII.
It has been determined by moft of our learned antiquaries, and particularly 
by our prefent guides, that this ftation was the 
AMBOGLANA 
Of the Notitia, where the Cohors prima ^Elia Dacorum lay in garrifon.
There 
is the ftrongeft confirmation of this, in the many inferiptions difcovered here.
Mr. Horfley fays, â€œ feveral of thefe (tones have been brought crofs the water to 
the face of the wall, fomewhere near this place.
I find other centurions of the name Prifcus, but with a 
different praenomen, as in one of thofe in Naworth garden, and another at Couftnâ€™s Houfe.
|| 
19 CENTURIO DADA.
Here is nothing vifible but the letters DADA, which have, I fuppofe, 
been a centurionâ€™s name.
The name Alenius Dada is upon a portable altar found at Carr-Voran, which 
I have in my pofTeffion, and has been already deferibed J The letters are but ill cut.
It is, at prefent, in 
the fore wall of a houfe within the fort at Burdofwald.

This ftone

It is remarkable for being eredted 
bv the fame century of Julius 7 ertullianus, who fet up that now at Oldwall.
Â§ And as this century is there 
find to belong to the legio fecunda Augufta, fo this fhews that the cohort here mentioned muft have been 
of that legion.

LEGIONIS SECUNDiE AUGUSTJE CENTURIA VOLUSIANA POSUIT.
This, 
with the three following, are in the garden at Naworth, or near it, and have, I fuppofe, been brought 
from the face of the wall, and, moft probably, from fome part of it near Burdofwald, or between that and 
Cambeck.
Thofe which mention the legion, have, it is moft likely, come from the ftation itfelf.
This is 
over the back door in the garden, and 1ms been ere&ed by the centuries Volufiana of the fecond legion, cal- 
led A igtijla.
The letters are diftinft, and it much refembles fome other of thefe inferiptions.
I believe 
one of the inferiptions, in the additions to Camden, is intended for this, though the reading is very different ; 
for it is thus reprefented in Camden.

LEGIO SEXTA VICTRIX P 1 A FIDELIS FECIT.
This ( now in Air. AlorritP s mufeum ) 
is a very fine and beautiful infeription, the letters being yet as diftinft as they were at firft.
I find 
Camden has publifhed it among the inferiptions at Willoford or Burdofwald ;* which makes it the more 
probable, that the others of this kind, which are now in this garden, have either come from this ftation, 
or the wall hereabouts.
The fimplicity of the infeription, and beauty of the character, inclined me to 
think this, and fome others like it, as ancient as Hadrianâ€™s time ; but of this there can be no certainty.
I muft now leave this inviting garden, and advance along the wall ; though I fhall be obliged once more, 
in a little time, to pay it a ftiort vifit.
25.
CENTURIO COHORTIS PRIMiE POSUIT.
I was told there were fome ftones with letters 
on them at a place called Lamerton, above a mile weft from Burdofwald, and clofe by the river Irthing.
I went thither in quell of them, but found them to be only centurial.
There are two, one of which is 
in a wall under a pair of ftairs, near the door of the houfe, with an imperfedl infeription.
It has been 
ere&ed by a centurion, or century, of the firft cohort ; but the name is effaced.
The other was in the 
feuth fide of the fame houfe, but nothing vifible upon it, except the centurial mark, and that faint and 
obfeure.
It was ot the fame fhape and fize with the other, fo that I have given no draught of it.
I was 
told that thefe ftones had been lately brought from the face of the wall near this place.

u Willoford, which led Camden to fuppofe the ftation was there : but it is ftrange 
** that any one who has been upon the fpot, and viewed the two places, fhould 
0 fall into fuch a miftake; for there are no appearances of a ftation at Willoford; 
â€œ whereas the ancient remains of the ramparts and buildings at Burdofwald are 
,f beyond all exception.â€ 
The fituation of this ftation is excellent, on a large plain, w'hich terminates with 
a very fteep defcent towards the river ; the eminence gives it command of profpeCt 
over the adjacent country ; and the afcent of the plain on every hand, at fome little 
diftance from the fort, gives it great natural ftrength.
Severusâ€™s wall formed the 
north rampart of this ftation: and it feems as if Hadrianâ€™s vallum had been cut 
through to open it on the other hand, for the yvork difappears without any other 
apparent caufe ; and, in the direction in which it runs on each fide, if it had remain- 
ed, it would have clofed in with the fouthern rampart.
The appearances which 
ftill remain, are the diftinCt lines of the vallum and fofle of the intire ftation ; many 
out-buildings or fuburbs to the fouth-eaft ; the entrances on the north and fouth 
fides are immediately oppofite to each other, in the centre of the vallum ; and fome 
faint marks of lefler ones on the eaft and weft fides; but thofe are not exaCtly in 
the centre, nor, as we think, to be infifted on as original.
At the fouth entrance, the foundations of turrets, or members of gateway towers 
are to be difcovered : in many other ftations we have remarked the like, though 
not conftantly on one certain fide of the ftation, but as fuited the grand approach ; 
and from thence we conjectured that many of the larger ftations were ftrengthened 
with towers.
In the interior part of the ftation, the foundations of houfes are 
fcattered, but the regular ftreets, as at Walwick Chefters in Northumberland, are not 
to be traced.
In the northern part of the ftation, there appear the ruins of a build- 
ing larger than the reft, which led Mr. Horfley to conceive, they were the remains 
of a temple.
The fite of the praetorium is very diftinct, though filled with a mo- 
dern ere&ion.
We have given in the notes, the feveral infcriptions found at this ftation, with 
Mr. Horfteyâ€™s readings and remarks, carefully extracted from his learned work; 
prefuming the curious in fubjeCts of Roman antiquity, will pardon the prolixity 
of a complete repetition of what that author deemed worthy of his obfervation, 
rather than be flint up, by a mere abridgement.
Several infcriptions have been difcovered fince Mr. Horfleyâ€™stime : the follow- 
ing were publifhed by Mr. Smith in the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, 1746, p.
537.
The firft, Mr. Smith informs us, is in the fouth-eaft 
wall of Naworth garden.
He read it â€” Peditum centum 
quinquaginta Britannorum , and thus proceeds.

THE ROMAN WORKS.
The diflance from this Ration to the next ad liniam yalli, called Cambeckfort, or 
Caft-fleeds, is near fix miles and a quarter.
In this fpace the remains of feven 
caftella are to be obferved at equal difiances, each interval being exactly feven fur- 
longs.
From Burdofwald, Severusâ€™s wall is open and diflind for above a mile; in 
fome places the facing ftones for two, three, and four ranges, or courfes, are to be 
obferved: Hadrianâ€™s vallum is rather hidden and confufed for fome little difiance, 
but afterwards, both it and the ditch are to be traced, and as we advanced wefiward 
ftill increafed upon us, till at length all the works were plain and diftind.
Near 
to Wallbours, the wall is a great height, and the military way perfed.
After we 
had palled the brook called Bankhillburn, we obferved the ridge of the ruins of 
Severusâ€™s wall very high, but no facing fiones are remaining in that part.
It was 
at this place, we prefume, Mr. Warburton fays, c< Is the highefi part of the wall, 
â€œ that is any where now to be met with ,â€¢ we meafured three yards and a half from 
<f the ground, and no doubt, half a yard more is covered at the bottom by the 
a< rubbifh; fo that probably it Hands here at its full original height.â€ The wall 
having been defaced at this place, renders the height of the ruin or innerfilling very 
remarkable; in many places in Northumberland, and particularly above the river 
Tippal, and to the heights of the cliff's there, where, by the freihnefs of the fcattered 
lime, it appeared that the facing fiones had been removed of very late years, no fuch 
remains of the interior parts of the w T all were to be obferved : and no certain reafon 
'can be affigned for the remarkable quantity of materials found here : we were led 
to conjecture, indeed, fome repairs have been made in this parr, of worfe workman- 
fiiip and quality, and not worth defacing and robbing, as the more perfed parts of 
the wall ; but thole are fuppofitions, acceptable or not, as the readerâ€™s fancy inclines.
Near Birch-fhaw, the diflance between the works meafured fix chains.
Severusâ€™s 
wall takes a fweep, and runs over the top of the hill, whilfi Hadrianâ€™s vallum 
avoids it.
Near High-wall-town, all the works are obfeure, and feem to have 
been defaced, in the progrefs of cultivation, and for the building of the village.
Mr. Warburton fays, At this place there feems to have been fome fortification 
or encampment ; one fide of the fquare is yet vifible, and the ramparts pretty

THE 
PARISH OF BEWCASTLE, 
AN 
EASY CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF BUETHâ€™s CASTLE.
T HIS is a very mountainous and barren diftrieft : the vales arc narrow, and 
afford fome pi&urefque feenes, but in general they exhibit poor and fcanty 
inclofures, mean cottages, an indigent race of inhabitants, fmall cattle, and a very 
ordinary kind of fheep.
In this article, the people feem particularly to fhew the 
want of fpirit for making improvements.
This animal, like many other of the 
productions, both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, is well known to dege- 
nerate, by breeding from one conftant race, without mixing and crofting the kind c 
and the fheep here have had no change for centuries : hence they are become fmall- 
limbed, goatifh, and hairy fleeced.
The mutton, with the fummer feeding, is de- 
licious, but it is fo very fmall, that a quarter feldom exceeds eight pounds weight, 
and the wool is only fit for the coarfeft manufactory, fuch as happings, horfe-fheets > 
rugs, and very ordinary blankets.
It is obvious, that a better breed would profper 
well, from the experiments made in Northumberland and fome parts of Scotland 
within the laft feven years.
The hills afford a fine verdure, wild thyme and other 
aromatic plants, and are excellent flieep-walks : it is a late obfervation, by a very 
judicious writer on national improvements, that wool of neglected fheep, in thefe 
mountains and northern climes, will be of three diftineft growths and degrees of 
finenefs, according to the changes of feafon, which renders it unfit for the better 
manufactories ; as the temperature of the air alters, the wool varies, fo that in the 
mildeft, or middle feafon, between the greateft heat of fummer, and the extremity 
of cold in w'inter, the middle part of each thread becomes finer than the bottom, 
and the outward points are as coarfe as goatâ€™s hair.
The mode of improvement 
has been pointed out, and praeftifed with fuccefs, and in thefe mountains might be 
eafily effected, by the fhepherdâ€™s change of ftation, and driving his flocks to the 
fouthern afpeefts in the depth of winter, and to the northern ones in the height of 
fummer.

â€œ Bueth being difpoflefTed himlelf, and he and his pofterity forced to fettle in 
â€œ Scotland, he made the place too hot for any of Hubert Vauxâ€™s pofterity, wafting 
â€œ all that part of the country in revenge, by frequent inroads upon the fame ;â€Â§ 
*â€¢ for, being greatly infefted by the Scots, as it is to this day, none durft inhabit 
there, till the barons of Burgh barony took upon them to fummer their cattle there, 
and made them fhields and cabbins for their people, dwelling themfelves in tents 
and booths for defence; at which time it was a wafte foreft ground, and fit for the 
depafturing of the cattle of the lords of Burgh and their tenants, they hav- 
ing no other pafture for them, becaufe the barony itfelf was very populous and 
well inhabited, fitting better for corn and meadow than for pafture.
And there- 
upon it was always found in ancient inquifitions as parcel of that barony, and to be 
hoiden of the fame.
But it is not within the faid barony, for the feignories of 
Liddale and Levington lie between Burgh and it.
It became inhabited long before

granted them to 
Hubert de Vallibus, the laft of that name in Gilfland, whofe daughter and heirefs, 
Matilda, married Thomas de Multon.
It is obferved that Thomas de Multon, being 
alfo lord of Burgh upon Sands, permitted his tenants and vaflals, of that lordlhip, to 
drive their herds and flocks for fummer pafturage into the wafles and mountains of 
Bewcaftle, the lands of Burgh being chiefly in tillage ; and this practice occafloned 
aconfu flon in the records of thofe territories, as from that period, Bewcaftle came 
to be ftiled parcel of the barony of Burgh.
Bewcaftle, after the Multons came to the pofleflion of the Swinburnes for feveral 
generations.
In the feventh year of King Edward I.
John Swinburne obtained a 
fair and market to be held here.
In the time of King Edward II.
we find it was 
held by Adam de Swinburne, as a member of the feigniory of Burgh; and in the 
reign of King Edward III.
it came to Sir John Striveling, by marriage of Jacoba, 
the heirefs of the Swinburnes, as mentioned by Denton.
It was in the crown in 
the reign of King Edward IV.
and that prince granted it to Richard, Duke of 
Gloucefter.
In the reign of King Henry VIII.
one Jack MufgraveÂ§ was governor, 
but in whofe right he held it, is not mentioned.
King James 1 .
demifed it to 
Francis, Earl of Cumberland, for 40 years term ; and King Charles I.
granted the 
fee to Richard Graham, knight and barrifter, to hold of the crown in capite, by one 
entire knightâ€™s fee, and 7I.
10s.
rent.
In 1641, the caftle was deftroyed by the 
parliamentâ€™s forces, by whofe fury many of the ancient fortrefles were laid in ruins.
Bewcaftle feems to have anciently been an extenfive town, by the fites and ruins 
of houfes, which yet remain : it is about eleven miles from Brampton, the neareft 
market town.
The remains of the caftle, the fouth fide of which is pretty entire 
and about fourteen yards in height, fhew that it was a dark and gloomy fortrefs, 
built in the moft barbarous order, and merely calculated for defence againft thofe 
ferocious bands of marauders, who conftantly annoyed this country, before the ac- 
cefllon of King James I.* The tower forms a fquare of equal fides; each front 29 
yards long.
From its vicinity to Scotland, it was continually fubjeeft to the fpoils 
of war.
fn 1 298, this territory fuffered greatly ; the Scots, after burning Hexham 
and Lamefly, in Northumberland, returned through Gilfland and the foreft of Nico- 
lai into their own country, carrying with them vaft quantities of fheep and cattle.
In the expeditions of Robert Brus and Edward Brus, Gilfland was the particular 
mark of their fury.
In 1333, Lord Douglas made great ravages here ; and in the 
19th year of King Edward III.
the country was pillaged and deftroyed.

In the church yard is an obelifk, which has for many years engaged the attention 
of the curious.
Drawings of it appeared in the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, in the 
year 1742, in wood-cuts, communicated by G.
Smith, Efq. and Mr. Armftrong, f 
the furveyor of land, engraved it a few years ago, out of regard to his native place.
In Biftiop Gibfonâ€™s edition of Camden, there is a long account of this monument, by 
bifhop Nicholfon ; all thofe we have examined with the original, and ftiall be bold 
enough to give our remarks in the fequel, as an attempt to illuftrate the annexed 
drawing.
In the abovementioned edition of Camden, it is thus deferibed: â€œ In the church- 
** yard is a crofs of one entire fquare ftone, about twenty feet high,Â§ and curioufly 
â€œ wrought ; there is an infeription too, but theft letters are fo dim, that they are not 
|| This Robert gave lands in Bewcaftle to the priorefs and nuns of Morrick, in Yorkftiire.
* The comment on this prefeription by N.
and ft.
p. 478, (hews the humour which prevails with church- 
men when they appear in the character of hiftorians.
f Captain Arnjlrongi whom we obferved had publifhed a plate of the Bewcaftle monument, and 
was a native of that parifh, inlifted into a marching regiment of foot, as a private foldier, when he was 
about twenty years of age: he had received a common fchool education, at or near Low Grains, his na- 
tive place; and though he chofe the army, was of an Induilrious difpolition, and of a fleady and perfe- 
vering mind.
His good conduct gained him the attention of his officers, and he was advanced firft to a 
corporal, and then to be a ferjeant, in the courfe of a {hort fervice.
In the latter capacity he became 
more and more ufeful in the corps, and his friends were multiplied ; fo that at length he was prefented 
to William Duke of Cumberland, with fuch warmth of encomium, and his condudt was fo proper, that 
his royal highnefs railed him progrefiively to the rank of captain of a company.
About the year 1764, 
he retired on halfpay, and took up his abode at an inn near Naworth caftle.
Mr. Jefferys, known to the world by the denomination of the Geographer, and feveral others, were 
about that time very defirous of promoting county furveys; Mr. Armftrong, ever active and induftrious, 
was willing to engage as an affiftant in an undertaking, for the due execution of which he was then alto- 
gether unprepared; not having ftudied in that branch of the Mathematics, or gained the leak know- 
ledge of the neceffary instruments, He had been fortunate enough to gain the acquaintance of the prefent 
Thomas Ramfhay, Efq.J a youth then about fixteen years of age, and a good furveyor.
They engaged to 
attempt a furvey of the county of Durham, and that work met with much approbation; from ftrength 
of genius and a fteady attention, M.
Armftrong, in a {hort time, became an expert furveyor, and Mr.
Ramfhay accompanied him till the greateft part of Northumberland was done.
He then became fo pub.
lie a character, as to require from us, in this place few other anecdotes, than to add, that he was indefa- 
tigable, a cheerful companion, temperate, affable, and friendly.

Â«* we may fuppofe that it has been erected by fomc of them.
The letters of this 
Â« f infcription appear {till legible upon a later view, a few of them were copied, but 
<f unfkilfully, A.
D. 1618, as Sir Henry Spelman witneftes A.
D. 1615, others 
<c are explained in a letter to Mr. Walker, fent him by the fame learned, and now 
â€œ right reverend perfon ; (Bifhop Nicholfon) who communicated his thoughts of 
u that at Bridekirk, to Sir William Dugdale, as follows: 
Sir, Carliflet 41 lb Nov. 1685.
u It is now high time to make good my promife of giving you a more perfect 
account of the two Runic infcriptions at Bewcaftle and Bridekirk.
The former 
is fallen into fuch an untoward part of the country, and fo far out of the common 
f< road, that I could not much fooner have either an opportunity, or the courage to 
f< look after it.
I was allured by the curate of the place, (a perfon of good fenfe 
Â«* and learning in greater matters) that the characters were fo miferably worn out, 
â€œ fince the Lord William Howardâ€™s time, by whom they were communicated to 
u Sir H.
Spelman, and mentioned by Wormius Mon. Dan.
p. 161, that they were 
â€œ now wholly defaced, and nothing to be met with worth my while.
The former 
â€œ part of this relation I found to be true, for though it appears, that the foremen- 
** tioned infcription has been much larger than Wormius has given it, yet it is at 
â€œ prefent fo far loft, that in fix or feven lines, none of the characters are difcernable, 
â€œ fave only Â» and thefe too are incoherent, and at great diftance from 
** each other.
However this epiftylium crucis (as Sir H.
Spelman, in his letter to 
â€œ Wormius, has called it) is to this day a noble monument, and highly merits the 
" view of a curious antiquary.
The beft account I am able to give you of it, be 
â€œ pleafed to take as follows : 
â€œ It is one entire freeftone, of about five yards in height, wafhed over, as the 
%t font of Bridekirk, with white oily cement, to preferve it the better from the 
** injuries of time and weather.
The figure of it inclines to a fquare pyramid ; each 
â€œ fide whereof is near two feet broad at the bottom, but upwards more tapering.
Cf On the weft fide of the ftone, we have three fair draughts, which evidently enough 
,c manifeft the monument to be Chriftian, The loweft of thefe, reprefents the 
portraiture of a layman with a hawk or eagle perched on his arm.
Over his head 
,f are the forementioned ruins of Lord Howardâ€™s infcription ; next to thefe, the 
* c picture of fome apoftle, faint, or other holy man, in a facerdotal habit, with a 
glory round his head.
On the top ftands the effigies of the B.
V. with the 
** babe in her arms, and both their heads encircled with glories, as before.
On the 
â€œ north, we have a great deal of chequer work, fubferibed with the following 
** characters, ijfijrlXXBURft XU, Upon the firft fight of thefe letters, I 
" greedily ventured to read them Rynburn; and I was wonderfully pleafed to fancy 
" that this word, thus fingly written, muft neceflarily betoken the final extirpation 
â€œ and burial of the magical runae in thefe parts, reafonably hoped for upon the con- 
** verfion of the Danes to the Chriftian faith; for that the Danes were anciently,

â€¢* articles of their creed : and to convince me yet further, that they are not utter 
" drangers to the black arts of their forefathers, I accidently met with a gentleman 
â€œ in the neighbourhood, whofliewed me a book of fpells and magical receipts, taken 
â€œ (two or three days before) in the pocket of one of our mofs troopers ,â€¢ wherein

I fhall not trouble you 
â€œ with a draught of this fpell, becaufe I have not yet had an opportunity of learn- 
" ing, whether it may not be an ordinary one, and to be met with among others 
â€œ of the fame nature, in Paracelfus or Cornelius Agrippa.
If this conjecture be 
not allowable, I have.
Sir, one more which, it may be, you will think more 
â€œ plaufible than the former: for, if indead of making the third and fourth letters to 
" be two qvIvJJ/SL we fhould fuppofe them to be XXE.E the word will be 
â€œ Rye Burn, which I take to fignify, in the old Damfh language, Cemeterium or 
â€œ Cadaverum Sepulchrum : for though the true old Runic word for Cadaver be 
â€œ ufually written Hr ere 5 yet the H may, without any violence to the 
â€œ orthography of that tongue, be omitted at pleafure ; and then the diflerence of 
â€œ fpelling the word here at Beaucadle, and on fome of the ragged mountains in 
â€œ Denmark, will not be great.
And for the countenancing of this latter reading, I 
" think the above-mentioned chequer work may be very available, fince in that we 
â€œ have a notable emblem of the tumuli, or burying places of the ancients, (not to 
" mention the early cudom of ereeding erodes and crucifixes in church-yards, which 
â€œ perhaps being well weighed, might prove another encouragement to this fecond 
â€œ reading.) I know the chequer to be the arms of the Vauxs or de Vallibus, the 
â€œ old proprietors of this part of the north ; but that, I prefume, will make nothing 
â€œ for our turn : becaufe this and the other carved work on the crofs, mud of ne- 
â€œ cedity be allowed to bear a more ancient date, than any of the remains of that 
Â«' name and family ; which cannot be run up higher than the conqued.
On the

ft When 
Bifhop Nicholfon was here again on the vifitation in 1703, he tried to recover 
" the Runic infcription on the w^ed fide of the crofs; but though it looked promifing 
â€œ at a didance, he could not afluredly make out, even fo much as that fingle line,

Having given the learned prelateâ€™s fentiments, w T e will turn to Mr. Smithâ€™s, 
publifhed in the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, 1742, p.
132.
The editor of that col- 
lection, previous to the infertion of Mr. Smithâ€™s papers, fays, 
â€œ We infert the following infcription, not doubting that it 
â€œ will fall into the hands of fome gentleman who underdands 
â€œ the language, and will pleale to give us the explication.
And 
â€œ fpeaking of the Magna Britannia, fays, â€œ This book gives us a

â€œ reprefentation, than that here annexed.â€ f f< That part of

â€œ ferved the remainder from their fury.
In the bottom and top divifions of the 
" north iide are cut vine trees, with clufters of grapes in demi-relievo, probably 
â€œ the Danifh fymbol of fertility, as amaltheaâ€™s horn was among the Greeks.
â€œ In a fillet above the under vine are the characters fairly legible, which the 
â€œ learned Bilhop Nicholfon expounds Rynburn, and thinks that it intimates the 
sf expulfion of the magical Runic, and their accefiion to Chriftianity.
But if I 
â€œ may be allowed to diftent from fo great a name, I had rather think it to be a 
â€œ fepulchral monument of one of the Danifh kings, flain in battle, and the reading 
â€œ I think will lupport my conjecture ; for there is no infiance of any nation ufing 
â€œ the firft character for an R, nor do I remember to have feen it fo explained in any 
* r of the Runic alphabets of Olaus Wormius, but the Danes about the Sinus Coda- 
4< nies made ufe of it for K : befides the R is Roman, wherever it occurs in this and 
â€œ other infcriptions on this monument.
The fecond is the MafayCtic U, a people 
â€œ about the Tanais.
The next two letters are wrong copied by the bifhop; the 
44 firft is a Q, or Scythian N, and the other an I, the following are Buru plain, 
44 and the laft is K final, for the initial and final K differing in this form, was com- 
â€œ mon in thofe nations, as the initial and final M to the Hebrews.
Upon the 
u whole I read it Kuniburuk, which, in the old Danifh language imports Sepulchrum 
â€œ Regis.
And the chequer work included betwixt the two magical knots, (the 
â€œ Scythian method of embellifhing funeral monuments) very much corroborates 
Â« my opinion.
However, I fo far agree with the bifhop, that it may alfo feem to 
If have been defigned for a ftanding monument of converfton to Chriftianity, which 
44 might have happened on the lofs of their king: and each mutually celebrated 
â€œ by it.
For Buchanan tells us, that in the reign of Donaldus, the fixth of that 
Â« name, the Danes having wafted Northumberland, were met and engaged by the 
44 united troops of England and Scotland, with fuch uncertainty of victory, that 
â€œ both fidcs were equally glad of peace, by which the Danes obliged themfelve& 
44 to embrace Chriftianity.
This, therefore, was a very proper monument for fo 
44 great a change, and the figure on the weft fide greatly contributes to favour this 
" conjecture, as I fhall fhew in my next diflertation on the other three fides.
This 
< 4 tranfaCtion happened about S50 years ago, and none believe the obelifk to be 
44 older than 900.
44 That the monument is Danifh, appears inconteftible from the characters ; 
44 Scottifh and PiCtifh monuments having nothing but hieroglyphics, and the 
â€œ right of the crofs itfelf.

Â«Â« of that nation left in Britain.â€* 
As fucceeding vifiters, we have to lament, that Mr. Smith never favoured the 
public with his promifed differtation on the other fides of this monument: his 
aflertion was hafty of the Scottifh and Pictifh monuments, as will be {hewn by the 
comparifon we are led to make between this monument and thofe vifited by Mr.
Pennant, and other antiquaries.
A friend, at our instance, before we had feen this monument, took fome pains to 
gain the infcription on the north- fide, in a manner we have often praddfed 
with fuccefs, by oiling the hone and prefling in wax, and then wdth printerâ€™s ink, 
taking upon paper the character: it was very confufed and impeded, but appeared 
much in this form, of which we confefs, we are not 
able to give a probable reading.
The ornaments of knots, flowers, and grapes, 
evidently appear to be the effed of the fculptorâ€™s fancy; and w'e think it would 
be extending a defire of giving extraordinary import to works of antiquity, to 
fuppofe they were intended to carry any emblematical meaning: they are fimilatr 
to the ornaments of the capitals and fillets in Gothic ftrudures of the eleventh cen- 
tury, or near that time, and no one yet prefumed to aflert they were to be conftrued 
as hieroglyphics.
Should we not attempt to objed to the readings of the infcription 
on the north fillet, and admit it might imply that the ground was famous for royal 
fepulture; in our apprehenfion it doth not advance the antiquity of the monument 
the leaft.
The infcription itlelf is uncertain ; for the prelate and Mr Smith took 
it varioully, and the wax imprefllon varied from both, and fuch, we conceive, would 
be moft accurate; the copies taken by the eye being fubjed to the effeds of light 
and fhade.
Let us examine the work, and perhaps we may draw from thence a more con- 
vincing argument.f Thefouth front is decorated in the upper compartment with a

knot, the next divifion has fomething like the figure of a pomegranet, from whence 
ifiue branches of fruit and foliage, the third has a knot, the fourth branches of 
fruit and flowers, beneath which is a fillet with an infeription, copied thus by 
Mr, Smith, but now appearing irrecoverable by any device : /\\ 
Beneath this, in the lowed: compartment, is a knot.
The eaft front is one entire 
running branch of foliage flowers and fruit, ornamented with birds and uncouth 
animals in the old Gothic ftile.
The crown of the pillar is mortaifed to receive the 
foot of thecrofs.
The north fide has, in the upper compartment, foliage and fruit, 
in the next a knot, in a large fpace next fucceeds the chequy, then a knot, beneath 
â– which is the fillet with the infeription, treated of by the Prelate and Mr. Smith.
Theweftfront is themoft ornamented, havingthe following fculptures; in the lowcft 
compartment well relieved, is the effigies of a perfon of fome dignity, in a long robe 
to the feet, but without any drefs or ornament on the head ; it is greatly fimilar to 
thechief figure on the north front of Bridekirk font, as to the fafnion of the garment ; 
on a pedeftal, againft which this figure leans, is a bird, which we eonceive, is the 
raffien, or raven, the enfignia of the Danifh fiandard.
This figure feems defigned 
to reprefent the perfonage for whom the monument was eredled ; and though ac- 
companied with the raffen, bears no other marks of royal dignity.
Above this 
figure is a long infeription, which has confided of nine lines; Mr. Smith delineates 
the firft three letters thus; I H N-f The S, in many old inferiptions, is formed 
like an inverted Z, and fometimes that letter, in its proper form, is fubflituted.
Late vifiters, as well as we, have great doubt whether any fuch characters were ever 
legible.
Great care was taken to copy the infeription, as it now appears ; which may 
perhaps afford a new conftrudlion.
Immediately above this infeription is the figure 
of a religious perfon, the garments defeending to the feet, the head encircled with 
a nymbus, not now appearing radiated, but merely a circular rife of the ftone; the 
right hand is elevated in a teaching pofture, and the other hand holds a roll; a fold 
of the garment was miftaken by Mr. Armftrong, (who drew the monument, and 
had it engraved, through regard to the parifh where he was born,) for a firing of 
beads.
We conceive this figure to reprefent St. Cuthbert, to whom the church, 
as Nicholfon and Burn fet forth, is dedicated.
The upper figures Mr. Armftrong 
reprefented like a mitred ecclefiaftic; but in that he was manifeftly miftaken, the 
effigies being that of the holy virgin with the babe.
There is no doubt that this 
â– was a place of fepulture, for on opening the ground on the eaft and weft fides, above 
the depth of fix feet, human bones were found of a large lize, but much broken

and difturbed, together with feveral pieces of rufty iron.
The ground had been 
broken up before, by perfons who either fearched for treafure, or like us, laboured 
with curiofity.
Whether the chequers were defigned or not for the arms of the family of Vaux, 
or de Vallibus, muft be a matter of mere conjecture ; we are inclined to think that 
armorial bearings were not in ufe at the fame time with the Runic characters.
We muft obferve, that on the old fculpture, found at Norham, in Northumberland, 
where the effigies of St. Cuthbert, St. Peter, and the royal faint Ceolwulf are cut, 
on x (tone which, perhaps, formed a part of fuch a monument as this, in the fillets 
arc the remains of an infcription, beginning with the characters 1 .
H. Z.
and con- 
taining feveral Runic characters.
That (tone was found at fome little diftance from the church of Norham, for- 
wards the eaft, where the prefent vicar, the reverend Mr. Lambe, in order to level 
the ground of the church-yard, cleared away the foundations cf w hat appeared to 
him to be the ruins of a cell appertaining to Lindsfarn.
Mr. Lambe, in his notes 
to the poem of Flodden Fight, of which he was editor, fays, â€” â€œ Out of the 
â€œ foundations of this cell, which belonged to the church of Holy Ifland, I dug a 
fione on which were cut the effigies of the three patrons of Norham church.â€ The 
fad is that Norham w as wholly a cell to Lindisfarn, and was built about the middle 
of the ninth century : had any confiderable ftrucfture flood where the ground was 
levelled by Mr. Lambe, (prefuming the eaft limb of the church extended no 
further than the prefent edifice) it would haveobftruCled and blocked up the great 
light of the altar: but we are apt to think, the chancel of the old church was 
totally deflroyed, and the fculpture buried in its ruins.
The reafon given in bifhop Nicholfonâ€™s letter, is applicable to our conjetftures 
on this monument, â€œ That the Danes w ere mod numerous here,and leaftdifturbed,â€ 
w hich reconciles the mixture of Runic character in an infcription of the eleventh 
century, as in fuch defert and little frequented tracks, that the chara&er might 
remain familiar both to the founder and the fculptor : where the Danes continued 
longeft and leaft difturbed, their imputations would alfo continue unaffeded by 
other modes, w hich were gaining acceptation and progrefs, in more frequented 
and better peopled fituations.
Monuments of a fimiliar nature to this, obferved by travellers, are, 
A crofs in the high road in Vdenor parifh, in Brecknockfhire, mentioned by

On this the infcription is cut from top to bottom, and the charac-

A monument in Flintfhirc, called Maen-y-Chw y van, of which a cut is given by 
Camden, Ed. 1695, and there a kind of rude infcription is reprefented.

** called the Weeping Crofs, a name analagous to ours.
This is of an elegant form 
t( and fculpture : it is twelve foot high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, 
<f and ten inches thick.
The bafe is let into another ftone.
The top is round, and 
â€œ includes, in raifed work, the form of a Greek crofs: beneath, about the middle, 
is another in the form of St. Andrewâ€™s, and under that, a naked figure with a 
â€œ fpear in its hand, clofe to that, on the fide of the column, is reprefented fome 
*' animal; the reft is covered with beautiful fret-work, like what may be feen on 
u other pillars of ancient date in feveral parts of Great Britain.
I do not pre- 
*< fume, after the commentator on Camden has given up the point, to attempt 
*' a guefs at the age, only oblerve, that it muft have been previous to the reign of 
â€œ grofs fuperftition among the Welfh, otherwife the fculptor Avould have employed 
â€˜ f his chiffel in ftriking out legendary ftories, inftead of the elegant knots and in- 
<f terlaced work that cover the ftone.
Thofe who fuppofe it to have been ereded 
** in memory of the dead (lain in battle, draw their argument from the number 
u of adjacent tumuli, containing human bones and fculls, often marked with mortal 
â€œ wounds; but thefe earthly fepulchres are of more ancient times than the elegant 
fculpture of this pillar will admit.
In thefirft vol.of the Archaeologia, a plate is given of a monument in Landevailag 
church-yard, two miles north of Brecknock.
The fculpture appears, from this 
reprefentation, very rude; the defcription given by John Strange, Efq. to the An- 
tiquarian Society, is to the following purport, p.
304.
â€œ It is a flat monumental 
%f ftone, feven feet ten inches long, and about fifteen inches wide in the middle.
â‚¬t The ftone was, I prefume, originally fepulchral, upon the upper part is carved, 
*' in very low relief, a rude, unpolifhed figure, reprefenting, perhaps, fome king, 
tc or military chief, arrayed with a fort of tunic, and holding a fceptre, fword, or 
** other inftrument, in each hand.
Over his head is a crofs, and under his feet an 
* f infcription ; the charaders of which are remarkably plain, exclufive of their be- 
<r ing a little disfigured by a fradure in the ftone.
What is really the meaning, or 
even the language of this infcription, is not eafy to determine, as the laft letâ€” 
ter appears reverfed, and fome of the others are different from any I can find in 
â€œ the Britifh charaders.
They continue very legible, as may be obferved from 
â€œ the exad copy of them in the engraving given of this ftone, which 1 am induced 
â€œ to efteem a remain of Danifh antiquity, from its perfed refemblance to many 
others allowed to be fo.
It was probably the workmanfhip of the fifth or fixth 
** century.â€ 
In Mr. Pennantâ€™s fecond volume of his Tour in Scotland, p.
166, he fays,â€” 
" On defeending, find ourfelves at Aberlimni.
In the church-yard, and on the 
* f road fide, are to be feen fome of the curious carved ftones, fuppofed to have 
Â«* been ereded in memory of vidories over Danes, and other great events that

Thefe, like the round towers, are local monuments; 
but ftill more confined, being, as far as I can learn, unknown in Ireland ; and 
â€œ indeed limited to the eaftern fide of North Britain, for I hear of none beyond 
â€œ the frith of Murray, or that of Forth.

The firft defcri- 
â€œ bed by that ingenious writer,* is that figure which Bands in the church-yard.
fC On one fide is the form of a crofs, as is common to moft ; Mr. Gordon juBly ima- 
c< gines that this was erected in memory of the vitBory of Loucarty; for in the upper 
*' part are horfemen, feemingly flying from an enemy ; and beneath is another, 
flopped by three men on foot, armed with rude weapons, probably the peafant 
â€œ Hay and his two fons, putting a flop to the panic of the Scotch army, and ani- 
â€œ mating his countrymen to renew the fight.
The next which I faw is on the road, 
â€œ with both fides full of fculpture.
On one, a neat crofs included in a circle; and 
â€œ beneath, two exceedingly rude figures of angels, which fome have miftaken for 
â€œ characBers.
On the other fides are the figures of certain inflruments, to me quite 
u unintelligible; beneath two men founding a trumpet, four horfemen, a l'oot- 
man, and feveral animals, leemingly wild horfes purfued by dogs; under them is 
,f a centaur, and behind him a man holding fome unkown animal.
This is the 
Â« f Bone mentioned by Boethius, to have been put up in memory of a defeat of a 
â€œ party of Danes belonging to the army of Camus on this fpot.

In the ornaments about the crofles, and the running patterns along 
Â« the fides of fome, is a fancy and elegance that does credit to the artifls of thofe 
â€œ early days.
Boethius is willing that thefe engraven pillars fhould be fuppofed

On one fide was a crofs ; in the 
upper compartment of the other fide, were two figures of men, in a fort of cloak, 
fC fitting on a chair, perhaps religious perfons; beneath them is another, tearing 
Â« f afunder the jaws of a certain beaft; near him a fpear and a harp; below is a 
â€œ perfon on horfeback; a beaft like that of mufimon, which is fuppofed once to 
" have inhabited Scotland ; and lafily, a pair of animals like bullocks, or the horn- 
" lefs cattle of the country, going fide by fide.
This ftone was about feven feet 
â€œ long, and had been fixed in a pedefial found with it.

â€œ This is fuppofed to have been erecBed in memory of the aflaflination of King

On one front is a crofs; on the upper

In Meigle church-yard, a column, â€œ in the upper part of one front are dogs and 
â€œ horfemen, below are reprefented four wild beafts, refembling lions devouring a 
" human figure.
The country people call thefe Queen Vanoraâ€™s graveftones; and 
â€œ relate that Ihe was the wife of King Arthur.
The next is very curious, on it is 
â€œ engraved a chariot, with the driver and two perfons in it; behind is a monfter, 
** relembling a hippopotamus, devouring a proftrated human figure.
On another 
â€œ ftone is the reprefentation of an elephant, or at leaft an animal with a long 
â€œ probofcis.
â€œ Mugdrum Crofs, an upright pillar, with fculptures on each fide, much de-

" animals.
Near this place flood the crofs of the famous Macduff, Thane of Fife, 
if of which nothing but the pedefial has been left for above a century pafl.
On 
" it were infcribed certain macaroni verfes.
Mr. Cunningham, who wrote an 
â€œ eflay on the crofs, tranflated the lines into a grant of Malcolm Canmore to the 
â€œ Earl of Fife, of feveral emoluments and privileges; among others, he allows it 
u to be a fan< 5 luary to any of Macduff â€™s kindred, within the ninth degree, who 
â€œ fhall be acquitted of any manflaughter, on flying to this crofs, and paying nine 
i( cows and a heifer.
<( The pillar of Do< 5 lan is at prefent much defaced by time, but fiill are to be 
Â« difeerned two rude figures of men on horfcback, and on the other fides may be 
â€œ traced a running pattern of ornament.
The ftone is between fix and feven feet 
*< high, and mortifed at the bottom into another.
This is faid to have been erefted 
Â«Â« in memory of a victory near the Leven, over the Danes, in 874, under their 
â€œ leaders Hunger and Flubba, by the Scots, commanded by their prince Con- 
â€œ ftantine II.â€ 
The column of Forres mentioned in page 88, is thus deferibed by the ingenious 
traveller, â€œ Near Forres on the road fide, is a vafi column, three feet ten inches 
*' broad, and one foot three inches chick; the height above ground is twenty three 
* c feet.
On one fide are numbers of rude animals and armed men, with colours 
< f flying: feme of the men feemed bound like captives.
On theoppofite fide was 
a crofs, included in a circle, and raifed a little above the furface of the fione.
â€œ At the foot of the crofs are two gigantic figures, and on one of the fides is fome 
Â« elegant fretwork.
This is called King Suenoâ€™s ftone; and feems to be, as Mr.

eredled by the Scots, in memory of the final retreat of the 
,f Danes; it is evidently not Danifh, as fome have aflerted; the crofs difproves the 
â€œ opinion; for that nation had not then received the light of Chriftianity.â€ 
In Mr. Pennantâ€™s voyage to the Hebrides, he gives a plate of a fine crofs in 
Oranfay lfle, and another in Hay; both richly fculptured,and having inferiptions, 
but he gives no reading or conjetfiure on their import.
Another monument is mentioned in Mr. Pennantâ€™s Welch tour, p.
373, called 
the pillar of Elifeg, and conceiving it to be pertinent, in comparifon to our fub-

â€œ tumulus; perhaps always environed with wood, as the mount is at prefeni, ac- 
â€œ cording to the cuflorn of the moft ancient times, when Handing pillars were 
* f placed under every green tree .* It is faid, that the Rone, when complete, was 
* f twelve feet high, it is now reduced to fix feet eight inches.
It Rood infixed in

The beginning of the infcription,

Â«* edificavit huttc Lapidem pro avo Juo Elifeg.
This Concenn was the grandfon of 
u Brochmail-ys-cithroe, who was defeated in 607, at the battle of CheRer. The 
â€œ letters on the Rone were copied by Mr. Edward Llwyd ; the infcription is now 
" illegible; but from the copy taken by that great antiquary, the alphabet nearly 
Â«Â« relembles one of thofe in ule in the fixth century.
â€ 
The laR monument of this kind which we (hall trouble the reader with in this 
place, is delineated in Mr. Gordonâ€™s ltin.
Septentrionale, p.
160, He remarks that, 
â€œ it was a nice obfervation of that learned and judicious prelate, fBifhop Gibfon) 
u that the monuments whereon no letters are engraved, are Scottifii and PiCtifli, 
4< and the others, with Runic characters, are true Danifh inscriptions.â€ 
After reprefenting and deferibing many monuments in Scotland, where procef- 
fions and the marching of troops are fculptured, and others with hieroglyphics, he 
gives two plates of a monument, which he thus deferibes : â€œ One I faw which 
differs much from all monuments hitherto deferibed; it lies flat on the ground 
â€œ within the church of Ruthvel, in the Rewartry of Annandale.
This obelifk,fome 
<r think, was originally of one entire Rone, but is now broken into three parts.
It

This monument has been engraved by the London Antiquarian Society, with

The altar reprefented in the cut was found lately, 
and is in the poffeffion of the Rev. J.
D. Carlyle.
Before we turn our Heps and leave this moun- 
tainous and defert tracft, no curiofity inducing us 
to proceed towards the north, we mull: remark 
that the inhabitants of this diftricl long retained 
their ferocity, and licentious kind of liberty, after 
the acceffion of King James, which, in a great 
meafure, put a flop to the depredations made by 
the banditti on the borders.
It had forages been 
the refort and receptacle of defperadoes, who were 
out-lawed by both nations, with whom the com- 
mon bulinefs of life was robbery and pillage.
This 
parifn was terrible, even in modern times, to of- 
ficers ofjuftice, and it is but within this century, 
the fheriffâ€™s officers dared to go thither to execute 
the procefs of law.
The pame of Bewcaftle men, carried with it a degree of 
terror, only lately fhaken off.* In the year 1 59 3, articles for repreffing enormities 
committed on the borders, were propofed and agreed on at Newcaftle, by the Earl 
of Huntingdon, lord lieutenant of the north, with the confent of Thomas, Lord 
Scroop, of Bolton, lord warden of the weft marches, and Sir Robert Gray, Knr.
deputy warden of the weft marches, and others, in which it is ftated, " Whereas 
*< within Bewcaftle, and other places, the head officer challengeth to have the 
*Â« efcheats of all offenders under him, by which means the fherift perceiving 
â€œ that the goods and chatties do go to the officer, and that himfelf fhall have only

Shaggy and long his yellow ringlets hung.
His waift an iron belted falchion bore,

His fearâ€™d and rudely painted limbs around 
Fantaftic horror ftriking figures frownâ€™d, 
Which monfter-like, eâ€™en to the confines ran 
Of natureâ€™s work, and left him hardly man.
His knitted brows, and rolling eyes impart 
A direful image of his ruthlefs heart ;

There are feveral romantic fpois which engage the attention of travellers; to the 
north of Bcwcartle, two hills called the Black and White Prertons, and Chrirtian- 
bury Crags, from whence extenfive profpecrts are had.
There is a rock bafon on 
the fummit of thefe crags conflantly full of water ; but whether fupplied by a 
fpring or not, is not yet afcertained.
There are two fchools in this parifh, fupported by public fubfcriplion : the marters 
are hired for about 10 /.
a year, and they go about with the fcholars in rotation for 
victuals, a privilege called in many places, â€œ a whittle gate.â€ 
The poor-houfe is on a regular foundation, the marter of which has a fixed 
falary of about 12/.
a year, with a fhilling a week for every pauper, the number 
fcldom exceeding half a dozen at a time.
The inhabitants in general are of rough 
and unpolifned manners, of a fhy temper, but not inhofpitable to Grangers â€” their 
inclination does not tend 10 agriculture: horfe-dealing and the care of their flocks 
and herds feem to occupy their attention chiefly.
Mechanics there are few.
The eaflern parts of rhe parifh are (hut in by a range of mountains extending 
from north to louth.
The foils confift of a fandy gravel, fome light foils lie on 
lime lfone, but much on clay; and it is faid, a vein of blue clay runs through 
the whole parifh, which holds the water, and renders the furface continually moirt.
The tillage lands produce wheat, beans, peafe, oats, barley, and potatoes; the 
chief crop is of oats, and that very me^n, no grain producing more than between 
five to eightfold : fcarce one-third of the parifh confifts of inclofed lands.
The 
annual rental of this parifh is 2140/.
and the poor-rate amounts to between 1 6d.
and 1 8 d.
yearly on an average, occafioned by paying out-penfions, to perfons not 
received to the poor-houfe.
The flock of fheep is generally about four thoufand, 
and one thoufand head of black cattle, which departure on the waftes.
Heifers of 
the Englifh breed will bring a price between 61 .
and 8/.
and a Highland bullock 
from two to five guineas.
The prices of provifions do not vary much from the 
Carlifle and Brampton markets.
The daily hire of labourers is from Sd. to tod.
with their victuals; mechanics i2d.
male fervants wages from 10/.
to 12/.
and fe- 
male fervants from 5/.
to 61 .

The fuel ufed by the inhabitants is peat and turf, with a mixture of coals.

to the peck.
There are two medicinal fprings in Bewcaftle, but negledted; one chalybeate, 
the other fulphur.
The Maiden-Way runs through this diftriirt.

thoufands of cattle and fheep pafs yearly : and yet it is to be remarked, that there 
are no ftatute fairs in Bewcaftle, for either the fale of cattle, or hiring of fervants.
No one is at the expence of taking a licence to fell ale or fpirits; yet at every 
turn there is a hut where whifky is fold in abundance.
No excilemen ever fets 
a foot in this territory ; and though the natives frequently qurrrel among them-

or rail, gleds, and Hawks.
Our plan of noticing not only men of great merit, but alfo men of eccentric charafters, and even noto- 
rious malefadlors, requi-es us to record here a remarkable free booter, or land-pirate, of this place, who 
died about fifteen years ago in Morpeth jail.
This man was named Thomas Annfrong; but, as is com- 
mon among vagabonds and thieves, he went by the nick-name of Socky Tom. We know not whether 
fuch Iawlefs men remained longer in thefe obfeure parts, than in fome others; but, fome of the feats of 
this man, who avowedly followed thieving as a trade, are hardly exceeded by the companions of Gil Bias, 
or by Robin Hood and Little John.
Two or three of them we will here fet down.
Riding to a fair at Newcaftle, he faw an horfe tethered in a field adjoining to the road: it was much 
better than his own; and fo he difmounted, and put his faddle on it, leaving his own in its place.
This 
hoife he fold at the fair to a gentleman, whom, with an appearance of great candour, he thus addrefied, â€” 
Sir this horfe is ticklifh and trouhlefome to drefs : if you 'will give me leave , I will fhew your fervant how to 
manage him.
The gentleman accepted his offer; and Tom having thus made himfelf acquainted with the 
liable, that night again Hole the fame horfe, which he actually left in the tether where he had firfl found 
him.
The fellow had much perfonal courage'; as fuch outlaws often have.
On the commiffion of fome daring 
crime or other, the conftables, aided by a party of foldiera from Carlifle, had befet his houfe; in which 
there was but one room ferving him for parlour and kitchen and hall.
Here, to the foot of his bed-poft, 
his horfe flood tied: and when the danger became imminent, he mounted this horfe, rufhed out of the 
door and forced his way, in full gallop, through the furrounding crowd, though fired at by feveral, and 
his horfe wounded by one of them in the thigh.
At another time, having ftoleji a fat hog, he was purfued by a fearch warrant* The bailiff and his 
pofie found him rocking a cradle; and he received them with the utmoft compofure and courtefy.
On 
being informed of their errand, he coolly obferved, â€” \y, you are much in the right to fearch: pray fearch 
well, and examine fevery corner: let me requeft you only not to make a noife, as the child with which my 
wife has left me in charge, is crofs and peevifh : I beg you not to awaken it.
The pig was in the cradle.
Many more fuch feats might be related; which prove only his mifer.ible mifapplication of very good 
parts; the confequence of which was, a wretched life, and an ignominious death.

The manor is now holden of the Earl of Carlifle, as a member of Gilfland.
This is a fmall parifh, bounded by the parifhes of Stapleton, Lanercoft, and 
Bewcaftle.
The church when Handing, was redtorial, and the impropriation was 
claimed by the prior and convent of Carlifle.
But when, or by whom it was given 
to that religious houfe, does not appear.
In Pope Nicholasâ€™s valor, it was rated 
high, but in the future valuations of livings, was not charged, being then wholly 
appropriated to the priory, and the parifh almoft depopulated and deftroyed by the 
Scots : it is prefumed the church has lain in ruins from the time of king Edward 
II.
when fuch dreadful devaftations were made in this country; nothing but Mat-

We now approached 
CASTLE-STEADS, 
Which is numbered the thirteenth Ratio*!
of the Romans on the wall, in Mr.
Warburtonâ€™s furvey, and by him and Mr. Horfiey thought to be the Petriana of 
that people.Â§ It is, by fome, at this day, called Cambeck fort.
Here Denton 
aflerts, hood the capital manfion-houfe of the Lords of Gilfland; but from what 
authority, he hath not noticed.
His words are , â€” â€œ Naworth caftle is now the 
â€œ principal feat of the barony of Gilfland, and hath fo been from Edward II.
â€™s 
* ( time.
â€” In the 36th of Edward III.
Margaret, daughter and heir of Thomas 
â€œ Multon, (laft of that name lord thereof) died feized thereof.
The ancient capi- 
Â« c tal manfion-houfe of Gilfland was at a place in Walton parifh, called the Cajtle- 
** Steed , where is, as yet, to be feen the ruins of the caftle, where Gill fil.
Bueth 
** dwelt, and which Hubert Vaux had of the gift of Henry II.
and it was called 
*' the manor of Irth-oon-Town, contracftly, Irthington villa ad rivum Irthing.
â€” 
* f The river gave name to the town, manor and caftle.
The lords thereof fuffered 
*' it to decay, as a thing of rude edification, and of the ruins thereof built Naworth, 
which, in fuccefs of time, was bettered by the owners; and by the like time.
t( through negligence, more than age, begins now to decline, and lofe that beauty 
<f and ftrength which it lately had, as all luch worldly things do, which are fubjedl 
a< to time.â€* 
This ftation is now furrounded with fine cultivated lands ; and, in the progrefs 
of improvement, mod probably would have been totally deftroyed and defaced, had 
not fome former proprietor of the eftate in which it lies, before the fpirit of culti- 
vation and enlarged hufbandry had taken place in this country, and the depredations 
committed by the borderers had ceafed, either planted, or, at Ieaft, fuffered the 
whole ftation, with its out-works, to be overrun with a foreft of oaks.
By the 
bottoms or ftoves of fome of the trees, which, when we firft vifited the place, 
A. D.
1778, appeared to be then lately cut down, they could not have attained 
the ftrength they fhewed in lefs than a century.
This, has, in a degree, preferved 
the diftindt figure of the ftation, and prevented the workmanâ€™s tools from turn- 
ing up many Roman remains, lately difcovered, and preferved by the prefent 
intelligent proprietor.
It lies about four hundred yards fouth f of the Praeten- 
turae of Hadrian and Severus, but muft be admitted one of the Rations ad 
linearn valli, as it occurs at a very proper diftance toanfwer to the ftation, called 
Petriana in the Notitia, where the Ala Petriana was fettled.
The two now com- 
monly accepted names of Cambeck fort and Caftle-Steads, are thus to be accounted 
for; the former from the lituation near the brook of Cambeck, the latter the com- 
mon appellation given to the caftella and Roman Rations of Cafters or Chefters.
The fituation of this camp is excellent, on the ridge of a hill, having a fwift de- 
fcent to the north and fouth, and commanding an extenfive profpedt northward, 
along the wall, having in view the ftation of Watchcrofs weftward, and Burdof- 
$ Gordon fays, â€œ much about the fame dimenfions as Carr-Voran fort.

to the eaft : and it was alfo capable of being alarmed by any beacon from 
Carr-Voran.
Camden, from an infcription, and the likenefs of names, was induced to fix the 
name of Petriana on old Perith, feated on the river Petril.f Mr. Gordon thinks 
the notitia is in confufion here, and that Camden had gained ftrong arguments to 
fupport his opinion, Â£ but, from Antonineâ€™s Itinerary, it feems incontrovertible, 
that the ftation of Old Perith was called Veroda and Mr. Warburton juhly ob- 
ferves 
In Mr. Horflcy'i 'work , we have the following infcription s : 
r. Cohors Nona Pcfuit.
This is of that fort which is ufu'ally found on the face of the wall, and has 
been eredted by the ninth cohort of one of the legions.
The letters are well cut, and the ftroke which 
is drawn through the middle, may poffibly have been defigned for a numeral mark, though it be continued 
from one fide to the other.
It was found in the wall near a cottage, called Kandylands, more than half 
way from Burdofwald towards Cambcck, and not long before I came there.
It has not been publifhed 
before.
2. E civitate Catuvellaunoruru Titus Oifedio Pofuit.
$ This is in the fore wall of a houfe at Howgill, 
a place about half a mile farther weft than Randylands ; and is of the fame fort with thofe that are 
found upon the face of the wall.
It was firft publifhed by Dr. Jurin in the Philofophical Tranfadtions, 
and fince by Mr. Gordon, who fays it may be read civitate Otadenorum ; but this does not appear 
to me, even from his own copy, though it be pretty much different from the original.
The learned 
Dr. Jr Tin's copy comes much nearer, though it is not altogether exatft ; for it is in the original 
diftinftly and plainly civitate c atvvellavnorvm, only the a in the firft line ftands awkwardly 
below the other letters, perhaps by having been omitted at firft.
The remark is certainly juft in 
the Tranfa&ions, â€œ That we cannot doubt this to have been the true name of that people, which

This 
â€œ nation appears by Dion to have been more potent than their neighbours the Dobuni (whom he calls 
â€œ the Boduni) and had, according to Ptolemy, Verolamium for their capital ; which, it is moft probable, 
â€œ was the Cafiivellauni oppidum of Cjefar.
Sothat it fhould feem Caffivellaunus, king of thefe Catuvellauni, 
â€œ when Ciefar, invaded Britain, either gave his name to this people, or took theirs.â€ The diftant fituation 
of thefe pecple is no difficulty at all in tliis cafe, any more than to find a cohort of diftant people at a 
ftation in Britain, or a Graecian arch-prieftefs ereding an altar here.
For no doubt the perfon who eredtÂ« 
ed this monument was in the army, and perhaps a centurion.
Nor does his being a Briton create any 
difficulty, for no doubt feveral of the natives of this ifland were in the Roman army.
Galgacus, the fa- 
mous Caledonian king, is introduced by Tacitus, as affirming that in his time many of the Britons were 
in the Roman army, and â€œ lent their blood to the fervice of a foreign power.â€ There is a fmall piece 
broken off the corner of the ftone, which probably contained the letter e.
It feems by its fhape and iize, 
and by being found upon the face of the wall, to have been of the centurial kind ; and I take it to con- 
tain nothing in it, but the name of the perfon who erefted the monument, and of the ftate or people 
to which he belonged ; his name feems to have been Titus Oifedio, or fomething very near it.
It 19 
plainly a c in the firft line after the e, though a break in the furface of the ftone might lead Mr. Gordon 
into the opinion of its being an o.
But there is fcarce any obfeure or doubtful letter in the whole in- 
fcription, excepting the firft in the laft line.
This Titus Oifedio, ]| though originally of the Catuvellaunf, 
might however be a Roman citizen, as the legionary foldiers and officers were, and as Titus, his preno- 
men, feems to intimate.

Â« eredled, from thefe words, though Bandurins feems to 
â€œ intimate, as if it appears firlt upon the coins of Gallienus.â€™ â€™ 
DEO SOLI MITRiE.
This is another infcription of 
â€œ the fame nature with the preceding, deo soli mitrae.
â€œ I cannot find that this has been publifhed before, which 
Â« 1 much wonder at, becaufe the title is curious, and I bc- 
Â« i; eve we have not another in (lance of it in Britain, though 
[ |j|jjÂ§|fÂ§ they are not uncommon elfewhere, as appears from Gruter

It is well known in how great veneration 
Vâ€” â–  â€” .
â– â–  â–  â€” â€¢ â€” â€” - â€” â€” â€” - the fun and fire were held by the ancient Perfians.
It is 
alfo certain that the Perfians gave the name Mithras both to the fun and fire.
From hence was the name 
introduced among the Romans; and the Roman infcriptions we meet with, and this in particular, plainly 
prove Mithras and the fun to be the fame, deo soli mitrae, that is, to the deity of the fun, whom the 
Perfians called Mithras.
The Trojans and Grecians are thought to have received the worlhip ot fire from 
the eallern people, efpecially the Perfians.
It is generally luppowd that Herodotus is miilaken, when 
he affirms the Perfian Mithras to be the fame with Urania or Venus cssleftis.
It has alfo been obftrved, 
that ths worlhip of Mithras was not a little in vogue in the Roman empire, efpecially in the fecond or 
third century, which favours the conjeaure about the time of ereding thefe altars.
_ I lhall only farther 
obferve concerning this infcription, that vis occurs in number xl of this county, as it it was a name, or

â€œ U IA \ caflle, and is Laid in Camden to have been found in the river Irthing, not 
far from this caftle.
Mr. Gilpin refers it to Cambeck fort, as well as the 
other; which is favoured by the river Irthing running fo nigh to this- 
fort.
The letters in this infeription are rude and meanly cut, and two 
or three of them entirely effaced.
But it is plain enough, that it has 
been ere&ed by one Aulus Domitius or Domitianus Paullinus to the 
local god Belatucader.
It is generally known, that Baal in the 
Hebrew or Phaenician language fignifies a lord, and exprefies a deity.
But I cannot recoiled a Hebrew word that has any affinity with the 
latter part of the name, and that is of a fuitable fignification, unlefs it 
be *D"T.O> which fometimes fignifies acies ; and that this was a god 
of war feems very evident, from his being joined to Mars in the inferip- 
, t â€˜ on fÂ° un< l at Netherby, deo marti belatucadro.
The learned Dr 
[ fUl^Gale, who once thought that the name might be derived from the 
L- â€” â€” word be/aw, which fignifies a fountain, feems rather to think, 
afterwards, that the latter part of it comes from fome one of the Britifh words cad praelium , cader 
caftrum or cadr forth .
A nd this derivation appears to me the moil probable ; though for this reafon 
too, I think, the nominative has been Belatucader, and not Belatucadrus , as the dodor has made it 
I fhall add the following conjedure of Mr. Ward.
â€œ Selden and Voffius agree in fuppofing Belatucadrus 
â€œ to be the fame as Belenus , or BrTuj, as he is called by Herodian.
And this deity both Herodian and 
â€œ Capitolinus fay was Apollo; and that he was worfhipped by the Druids, we learn from Aufonius.
Â« Whether s in the firft.
line of this infeription was deligned for Soli or fantto may be doubtful, becaufe it is 
Â« ufed for either of thofe words.
If we read it Soli, it will agree with N.
xxix, Mithras being the 
name by which he was worfhipped in the eail; and this, as I would fuppofe, in thefe weftern parts.
â€œ But if we read it faiifio, it will equally agree to Apollo, this being an epithet given to him not only in 
inferiptions, but likewife by the poets.
So Pindar: 
Zr,) 'X, ttcei xynoii â€™ K-rroWuict.
41 And there is another infeription of this county, which begins with deo saucto belatucadro.
â€” I 
â€œ cannot therefore but incline to think this deity was the fame as Apollo, rather than Mars, both from 
4 * the affinity of this name, with other names of Apollo, and becaufe I do not find the epithet fanthu ever 
â€œ given to Mars.
Indeed there is one infeription of this county, which if perfed, would decide this 
â€œ difficulty in favour of the other opinion ; for it begins deo marti belatvcadro.
But the original 
â€œ of this is loft, and it is plain it rnuft have been obfeure, or very ill taken, when it was firft copied; for 
â€œ there is nothing elfe intelligible in it but thefe three words.
And therefore I cannot but think it was 
â€œ originally deo marti et belatvcadro; fince it is no more inconfiftent to make thefe two deities 
a cvuZauai, than Minerva and Hercules.â€

Viftoria Augujli .
The infcription is very clear and diflinft, and the letters well cut, though the a has 
no tranfvei fe.
If Caracalla had done much, or been victorious here, during his fingle reign, I Ihould 
think that the cut of the letters and other circumffances of the infcription, together with the fingle g in 
avg.
implying that a iingle emperor leigned at this time, might have agreed to his reign, after the death 
of Severus.
But I rather imagine it has been Commodus, for there are infiances of the a wanting a 
tranfveife as early as this.
Severus and Caracalla were fuccefsful in their expedition againfi the Caledo- 
nians, but yet I meet with no inferiptions that feem to refer to their victories; add Caracalla, as I have 
fhewn elfewhere, left the ifland immediately after the death of his father.
This inclines me to the opinion 
that feveral other inferiptions of the fame nature belong to the emperor Commodus.
Yet there is an in- 
fcription or two to Caracalla after he had left this ifland, though I think of a different nature.
But this 
I leave to the judgment of others.
Thefe two Hones, though exa&ly of the fame lhape and lize, yet 
feem to have been always diltinft; for they are no way like to broken pieces of the fame ftone.
How- 
ever I believe they have been fet clofe together in the fame wall and both refer to the fame thing.
The 
leg of ViCfory Handing upon the globe is naked, fomewhat higher than ufual.
The Pegafus and fea-goat 
I find in other fculptures, efpecially the fea-goat.
The one I fuppofe may denote the fwiftnefs of the 
Victory, and the other the maritime fituation of Britian.
Thefe two Hones I faw at the Cliff, near 
Kirklinton, the feat of the late Mr. Appleby.
7. Legio Sexta Vich ix fecit.
This is alfo at the Cliff, having been removed thither.
It was found in 
the eaH part of the Hation near the gate.
The letters are rather more rude than ordinary.
I am of" 
opinion that thefe legionary inferiptions which wc meet with in the Hations, were moH of them ereCted, 
when Severusâ€™s wall was building, at the Hations where the body of the legion quartered; and that the 
inferiptions of the particular cohorts, that were working upon the feveral parts of the wall, were inferted 
in the face of the wall in thefe feveral places.
But this infcription is fo rude, as to give me a fufpicion it 
might be ereCled much later, when the fort, or fomewhat about it, has been repaired.
8 Omnium Gentium templum olim vetujlate conlabfum , Gajus â€™Julius Pitanus provincite praefes 
Rtfiituit.
We have here a very curious infcription lately found at this fort, and iince removed to the Cliff.
It was dug up near the eaH entry of the Hation, andfeemed to be in the fouth jamb of the gate with the 
face downwards, where feveral pieces of broken pots or urns, with other reliques of antiquity, were alfo 
found.
The Hop that follows the name Julius Pitanus is very remarkable.
It has been taken for d or 
on, but I beg leave to differ from this opinion, and cannnot but think that both the fliape and magnitude 
of it was purely defigned to fill up the fpace, as we find the other Hops, or flouriflie8, fuited to the feveral 
places where they Hand.
The followiug p p is, in the opinion of fome excellent antiquaries, to be read 
either propiia pecunia , or publica pecunia ; but I humbly conceive thefe letters rather contain fome farther 
defeription of Julius Pitanus from the office he bore.
If they do not, we have no more than barely his name, 
which is not ufual in fuch an infcription, efpecially if the work was done at his own coff .
p p is mani- 
fefily put for propraetor in another infcription in this county, which I fhall foon have occafion to mention.
And yet as this infcription fee ms to have been late in the empire, ths office of propiaetor might then poffibly 
have ceafed in this ifland, if it did not continue after Conflantineâ€™s time; and then we mufi not read it 
propraetor , but praefettus provinciae , c*r provinciae preefes , or praefeflus praetoria..
The infcription is 
curious and valuable, both as it furniflies us with an argument to prove that the Romans were late poffeffed 
of this Hation ; and alfo as, 1 think, it affords us the name of a new governor not mentioned in any other 
infcription, nor in Roman- hifforians; who, I fuppofe, mud have been under fome of the later emperors.
Julius Pitanus might be the praefettus praetorio under Caraufius, if fo at all.
And perhaps his rebuilding 
or repairing fome forts, or other public edifices upon the wall, may have given rife to an opinion, that he 
built the wall itfelf, though it is certain he did not.
When there was an emperor here in perfon, (and 
fuch, it is plain, Caraufius was owned to be) there was no occafion for a propraetor , nor was it proper

Among the bufhes and roots of trees, appeared the ruins of buildings all over the 
inclofure, rhough not fuch as might diftinguifh the fite of a caftle, fuch as Mr.
Denton places here: â€” they formed no regular figure or order.
The whole ap- 
pearance of the llation at that time (hewed it had been very little fearched, and the 
mere 
that the praefeclus praetorio in Gaul fliould intermeddle in the Britifh affairs, though they afterwards fell 
under his conduct.
It is more probable that an emperor here in perfon would have a pracfeftus praetorio 
with him.
Afterwards this was a very grand officer, and four of them ruled all countries under the em- 
peror, of which the prae/efius praetorio Galliae had the command of Britain.
If the infeription be fup- 
pofed to have been erected when this was the cafe, we muff then read fot p p provinciae praefes or praepofitus.
We have the cohots quarta praetorio at Drawdikes.
How far this may favour the opinion that a 
praefedus praetorio might, upon fome occafion, be here in Britain, I leave others to judge.
I know not 
whether it will be looked upon as a material objection again!!
reading provinciae praefes , that the wall, 
and this fort upon it, where the ftone was found, is (according to the received opinion) in one of the 
two conlular provinces, and not in any of the three, which, according to the Notitia, had each of them 
a praefes.
The fpaces and imperfed!
remains of the letters appear to favour the reading matribvs in the

line, as well as the confideration of its being a temple that was now rebuilt; and though we ffrould no 
where elfe meet with matribvs omnitm gentivm, yet I cannot think that a conclufivc argument again!!
this reading.
But Mr. Ward thinks it has rather been victoribvs omnivm gentivm, and obferves, 
that â€œ Bandurius produces three coins of Conftantinus, Conffantius, and Maxentim, with this infeription: 
â€œ victor omnivm gentium.
This temple therefore, he fuppofes, might be ereÂ£!ed after the many and

We are much obliged to Mr.
Gordon for this altar, who fir!!
difeoveredand publifhed it, and has fince prefented it to the right hon.
the 
Earl of Hert r ord, in whofe poffefiion it now is.
When I was at London, in 1729, I could not get a 
convenient opportunity of copying this infeription myfelf : but Mr. Gale was pleafed to charge himfelf 
with the care of it.
I !hould not therefore need to fay that I have fince feen it myfelf, but that 1 think 
I am obliged to acknowledge this inftance of my Lord Hertfordâ€™s great and fo well known humanity.
The fecond word in this infeription differs from Mr. Gordon a little, but I found Mr. Gale to be in the 
right.
Indeed the letters sang joined to Marti would very naturally lead one to think of fanguineo, 3 
proper epithet for Mars, and an epithet that is aferibed to him by the poets : 
Qualis apud gel'tdi cam flumina concitus Hebri 
Sanguineus Mavors clypeo increpat .* 
But fanguineus is an epithet of Mars, which no where occurs in infetiptions, whereas fanflus is thought 
to be fometimes attributed to him, as well as to Belatucader.
Some of our be!!
antiquaries therefore 
think, that as c and g are often interchanged, fo it happens to be here; and that we-are therefore to read 
Deo fat Ho Marti.
But Mr. Ward chufes to adhere to fanguineo, rather than think the artifi: 
chargeable with a miftake in putting g for c.
â€œ The ufual epithets of Mars are taken from fuch things 
â€œ as accompany war, and exprefs terror or dellrudlion; and this particularly of fanguineus is given him 
0 by Ovid : 
Vel tu fanguinei juvenilia rnunera Martis 
Sufcipe: deliciae jam tibi terga dabunt.

41 And likewife by Virgil in the paffage quoted above; where Servius explains fanguineus by atfto^stgns,' 
" as an epithet or title of Mars among the Greeks.
The title of ultor feems to have a near affinity with 
u this, which is not uncommon both upon altars and coins ; but that of fanfius neither appears to fuit 
â€œ his charafter, nor do any othe certain inftanees occur where it is given him.â€

mere fuperftructures of the edifices leemed to have been pulled down, or taken 
away.
This ftation is dillant from Watcbcrofs about three miles, in which fpace there 
are the vifible remains of three caftelia, and the fite of one other caftellum, Mr.
Warburton fays, was difcernible fome few years before he vifited the wall, but was.
then quite defaced.
The intervals between the caftelia are equal and regular, juft 
feven furlongs each.
The date of the pretenturae ofSeverus and Hadrian in this tradt is various; the 
land through which they pafs having been, in many parts, cultivated for acourfe 
of years, they are almolt totally defaced.
It is difficult to trace Hadrianâ€™s vallum 
with any degree of certainty â€” near Cambeck Hill, Severusâ€™s wall and the works- 
totally fwept away â€” from thence to Irthington, the wall and ditch are difcernible 
There are yet two inferiptions, the originals of which I have earneflly wlfhed to fee, but In vain.
The account Camden gives of them is in thefe words: â€œ At Caftle-Steads, (which is another name for 
â€œ Cambeck.
fort) as alfo at Trederman hard by were found thefe inferiptions, which the right honourable 
â€œ William Lord Howard, of Nawortb, third fon of his grace Thomas Duke of Norfolk, copied out for me 
â€œ with his own hand.â€ This account feems a little confufed, for Trederman is much nearer Burdofvvald 
than Cambeck fort, and there is nothing Roman at that caftle or about it.
I was in great hope*, 
however, of finding thefe among the colle&ion at Naworth, but could meet with nothing of them there.
There is half an altar {landing in a gate at Naworth, but I cannot think it has any relation to Camdenâ€™s 
inferiptions.
There is alfo a large altar built up in the jamb of a chimney at Whitefield, about a mile 
weft from this fort, which the old people fay was brought from thence, or a part of the wall vary near itâ€” 
But both the altar and infeription have been defaced by the mafons, fo that at prefent there is not any 
â€¢vifible letter upon it.
I muft thtrefore give the inferiptions juft as they are deferibed in Camdenâ€™s Britannia 
though they are very obfeure and imperfedt.
The firlt is thus :

The three laft lines in the frill infeription 
might piobably contain fome farther defeription of 
the prefedt, or the names of the confuls ; but they 
are (to me at leaft) unintelligible.
The third line 
looks like the name of a place, but what this fiiould 
be I annot imagine.
I find a place called Ilkirk, 
in Cumberland, and Olerica, in Ravennas.
The cut 
of the l is remarkable in Camden.
It is the fame 
with the fifth in the table of letters, and k is a pity for 
that reafon we cannot fix tire date of this infeription.
However it appears from hence, that this fhape was 
introduced before cohors prima Tungrorum fettled 
at Borcovicus or Houfe-Steads.
I believe the iv in the beginning cf the latter infeription has rather been im, and that imperatori Caefari 
has been the firft line, though this is uncertain.
I have nothing more to obferve with relation to thefe 
inferiptions, excepting that the cohors prima Tungrorum , fo clearly mentioned in both, feems after this to 
have removed from hence, and fettled at Houle-Steads, in Northumberland, the ancient Borcovicus, 
where the Notitia found them.

but very faint ; and Hadrianâ€™s vallum is fcarce to be afcertaincd ; what is like its 
appearance, is about three chains difiant from Severus's works.
Mr. Warburton, 
when he viewed them, found them in what he calls the fecond degree, but they are 
much reduced lince that time.
At Old Wall, the feveral works may be difcovered, 
the didance between thofe of Hadrian and Severus, being about ten chain ; but 
there can be little certainty in all this trad, for where the ground is not in culti- 
vation, it is, in feveral parrs, overgrown with brufhwood.
Mr. Warburton fays, between Old Wall and.
Bleatarn, is a place called the 
Houfe-Steads, where, about feven years before his furvey was made, an altar was 
difcovered then at Scaleby, without any vifible infcription.
The chief caufe of 
robbing and defacing the Ration, feems to have been the building of Mr. Dacreâ€™s 
houfe and offices, at Caftle-Steads, within a quarter of a mile of it : in the walls 
of which are many Roman remains preferved, particularly the pillars of the floor 
of an hipocanft, vffiich are built up in many parts of the barn, with cornices and 
mouldings fcattered here and there.
In the wall of the ftable is the fculpture, marked No. 5 in the plate annexed: 
the w hole ftone is about -twenty-feven inches long, and twenty-two wide, and the

TWO FRAGMENTS OF INSCRIPTIONS.
Two pieces of a glafs bowl, preferved by Mrs. Appleby, 
|| one of which has the name of Adleon in Greek capitals, cut, as 
ll lfuppofed r with an adamant, and the other, which is a piece of 
^^^Ithe fame bowl, has a dogâ€™s head fair on it; fo that the fable of 
that prince has been engraved on this veffel.
Â« The glafs bowl is very curious, but the fragments not being at the edge any 
â€œ where, it is impoffible to judge of its capacity.
One of the pieces is about one 
Â«* inch and eight-tenths length-ways, and one-tenth crofs, or, to fpeak mathemati- 
â€œ caliy, the chord is about one inch and eight-tenths long, and the fagitta,or verfed 
â€œ fine, one-tenth, whereof the diameter ought to be eight inches and one-tenth at 
Â«* that place ; but thefe are extremely difficult in fuch fmall arches to be accurately 
<f determined.
No doubt but the fable of Adteon was the hiftory on the bowl, and 
â€œ it is great pity it had not been entire.â€ 
â€œ In the wood, where the fort has been, that lady found, fome time ago, buried 
<f in the rubbiffi, a regular clay-floor, with feveral pedeflals upon it, and betwixt 
u every two of them a hollow parallelopipedonof burnt clay, of fixteen inches long, 
4t and fix wide, with a hole through the oppofite fides.
The ufe of thefe pedeftals is 
â€œ hard to be conjedlured, unlefis to carry off the damp from the floor, which 
was laid over it; but as pipes went through thefe holes, it would rather feem 
â€œ like a contrivance to warm a hot-bath.
The lady tells me there is not one- 
44 fourth of them left that were there when file firft difeovered it.
â€œ The dimenfions of the hypocauflum are five yards by nine within the walls; 
" the ground-floor was of clay, in which the ftone pedeftals were fixed about four 
" or five inches deep, more or lefs, fo as to bring them to a perfedt level at top, 
their height, including the depth in the clay, is generally about two feet; fup- 
â– â€œ ported by thefe pedeftals, was a fecond floor of white ftone, about one inch thick,

â€œ and curioufly cemented for the bath.
The parallelopipedons of burnt clay were 
Â« placed quincunx form, betwixt every other row of thefe pedefials, and were 
â€œ five or fix inches fhort of their height, in order to give paffage for the fmoke to 
* c warm the bath ; but, in order to the better underflanding of them, I fhall give 
Â«* you an ichnographical plan of a few of them : â€” 
A â€ Here the fquares reprefent the ichnography of the 
fH H| Q * pedeftals, and the nVthat of the clay parallelopipedons, 
" which were omitted in every other row, as A B.
|â€œ There were about one hundred pedefials in all, two 
â€œ pedefials, and the vacuity took up about twenty-eight 
|â€œ inches, as near as can be judged from the prefent fiate 
â€œ of their fituation on the floor.
| â€œ Mrs. Appleby, who deferves to be gratefully re- 
<( membered by all lovers of antiquity, took great pains 
g|] g| ^ gg| f â€˜ to preferve what fhe could of thofe valuable remains of 
B â€œ the ancients, fhe found there the ruins of the bottom 
Â«Â« and fides of an iron grate, which that lady fiill has at Cafile-Steads, and fome 
* f pieces of charcoal were lying up and down on the floor.
Â« Adjoining to the fouth wall, where the grate flood, were two curious rooms, 
Â« fupported in the fame manner with pedefials, and conduits betwixt them, fiill 
Â« running frefh when that lady found them; but on admiflion of the air, all have 
t( gone to ruin.
The floors of thefe rooms that refled on the pedefials, were paved 
Â« in the fame manner as the bath, with this addition, that a curious cemented com- 
â€œ pofition of lime, brick-dull, and pebbles, at leall four inches thick, was fpread 
<Â« over the flone of a wonderful hardnefs.
Such care have that warlike people 
Â« taken to render the climate of thefe northern regions agreeable to their con- 
â€œ flitutions.
tf There were many other curious floors found amongfl the ruins, and fomc 
Â« coal-afhes: but I am apt to believe, that the old caflle of the de Vallibus, pro- 
â€œ prietors of Gilfland after the conquefl, hath been built on the ruins of this fort, 
Â«Â« becaufe feveral curiofities, that intimate a more modern date, have been found 
Â«Â« here.
It Hands, as moll other Roman forts have done, on a lingula, as near as 
â€œ the defence of the wall would admit, betwixt the rivulets of Irthing and 
â€œ Cam beck.
Â« There was alfo a cold-bath found near the place, and not far from it fome- 
Â«< thing like a ciflren, about five yards by one and a half, compofed of thick fiate 
Â« flones very large and fet edge-ways, curioufly cemented fo as to refufe paflage to.

Â«Â« oppoiite aperture on both fides, was found (landing perpendicular,â€ as in the 
figure No. 1 2 in the plate, <c as Mrs. Appleby told me, though by the appearance

Six or feven of thefe pedefials are built

,f The inclofed figures,â€ 4 and 4 in the plate, " are thofe I mentioned to you in 
<l my former.
The figure has been found fince, and was, I prefume, removed after 
" it was broke, for no part of it could be found for fome difiance on the ground 
â€œ round where it lay, which was cleared on purpofe.
The fort is an oblong Iquarc, 
â€œ from the foutheaft front, the ground is declining towards the river Irthing, on 
" which ground there are fiill vifible, the foundations of walls and ftreets, but 
â€œ removed for the fake of buildings and tillage ; on the other fide is a fteep bank, 
t( under which the Cambeck runs, coming from the wall.
The whole fortrefs 
â€œ feems to have been a very fumptuous and fine building ; moftof the (tones that 
â€œ are dug up, are black, as if the whole place had been burnt; and what confirms 
" me more in this opinion is, that in feveral places, as yet dug into, there are great 
â€œ numbers of iron nails, pieces of iron and brafs, that are run into lumps, though 
â€œ now in a mouldering condition.
There are alfo fquare tiles found, of aboutan inch 
â€œ thick, with a ledgeon an edge, by w hich they hung on the roofs of houfes.
They are 
â€œ about ten inches by nine, and of a yellow clofe metal; they find there alfo, many 
" earthen veflels of different figures and colours, fome of which were whole, till 
â€œ broken by carelefs digging : I think the longeft fides of the fort are about four 
â€œ Gunterâ€™s chains, and the fhortefi about two and a half.
I fhall take a particular 
â€œ draught of it, if you pleafe to have it ; I am very apt to believe Mr. Gordon did 
" not fee it, as being at fo great a diftance from the wall.
There are feveral foun-

Another Letter from Mr. Richard Goodman.
Carlijle> id January, 1727-3.
*' Be pleafed to pardon my long filence to your laft, and believe me it has not 
been through negligence of your commands, but being told that one Mr. Horfley 
* f had fent for the infcription, and that he had promifed to fend Mrs. Appleby his 
thoughts thereupon, I had a defire that you fhould fee them.
I have been 
Â«* leveral times, fince your laft, at the Caftle-Steads, and found, by your directions, 
that the three laft: letters of the broken line were BVS, the upper part of the B 
Â« being broke, and the S very faint.
But Mr. Horfley has no regard to the ftops 
*â€¢ like hearts that I mentioned to you, nor the figure O, ending the laft line but 
4f one; the two OO, which begin the word conlapfum , are very fair circles, and 
*' have no refemblance of the letter C, notwithftanding the word could not be fenfe 
â€œ otherwife.
Mr. Horfley fancies alfo the propraetorâ€™s name to have been Caius 
Â«< Julius Pitanus, and has no regard to the flop, which feems to me very arbitrary, 
or the fculptor much more fo, who made the flop between the letters CO and 
Â« 1VL, which he calls Julius , fuppoflng it to be an L, becaufe it is fomewhat 
Â«< wider at the bottom than the top.
The other he calls S ; if fo, it is turned the 
direCt contrary way.
Thofe places in the infcription, which I have marked 
Â« with pricks, are broken places in the ftone.
Mr. Horfleyâ€™s account is as follows, 
Â« viz.
" That Caius Julius Pitanus proprietor ( lord lieutenant of the pi ovine e ) had rebuilt 
Â« a temple y f acred to the goddeffes , the mothers of all nations , which age and time had long 
Â« ago ruined.â€ You have inclofed another copy for your obfervation, the letters 
Â« are as exaCt as I could make them; there are razures in the ftone, which are the 
Â«Â« ruling of the lines, they are cut pretty deep, and the lower end of the letters fall 
Â« into them, but I cannot think the I is an L, as he makes it in his fenle of it.

Mr. Galeâ€™s Anfwer.
I'ld February , 1727-8^ 
u I think I can give you the true reading of fo much as is left of the infcription 
Â«Â« you fent me, that was lately found at Caftle-Steads, which is as follows : â€” 
** Vtdloribus Omnium Gentium Fernplum olim vetujlate conlabfum, G.
'Julius 
" Petuanius de propria pecun.
rejlituil.
I never met with the De<e Matres omnium- 
â€œ Gentium in any infcription, or elfewhere.
Therefore believe this refers to two 
â€œ emperors reigning at the fame time, who, from the conquers they had made, 
â€œ are here flattered with a dedication, Vidioribus omnium Gentium , as the emperor 
â€œ Probus was complimented with the flyle of Vidior Gentium barbarum : the top of 
<f the (lone being loft, it is impofiible to fay who thefe emperors were : the CON 
â€œ in the ftxth line, can be nothing but CON, though the ftone-cutter has blun- 
** dered the C into an O.
In the feventh, I am fatisfied the C, with the heart 
â€œ or leaf after it for a ftop, ftands for Gaius, and IVI^ for Julius : the laft cha- 
â€œ raCter being an abbreviation or contraction for VS.
In the eight, P 1 TANVS 
** muft be read, as is plainly evident from the remains of the letters, Petuanius , 
,r which is the name of a Roman family frequently occurring in Gruterâ€™s Thefau- 
** rus of infcriptions, and not Pitanus> as Mr. Horfley takes it to be.
It is a very 
â€œ great miftake to make him a propraetor here, for the characters D, P.
P. are no 
more than de propria pecunia , denoting that this Gaius Julius Petuanius rebuilt 
â€œ this old ruined temple at his own expence ; and thus have the explanation of the 
â€œ character D, which Mr. Horfley totally difregarded.â€ 
We beg leave to obferve, that it appears, from the conftruCtion of the floors, 
before described, that the invention was folely to warm the apartment j the clay 
tubes had no communication with any fire or ftove below ; they w ere made to 
hold burning charcoal, and thereby to warm, in a gradual manner, the floor above.
Two of the infcriptions mentioned in Mr. Horfleyâ€™s work, require particular 
attention.
â€” It w r as obferved in the View of Northumberland, upon the altars in- 
fcribed Deo Mogonto , found in one of the ftations on the river Reed, and in the 
mountainous parts of that county, that the Romans, in order to reconcile the na- 
tives to their religion, adopted the deities worfhipped in the feveral diftriCts, and 
altars were dedicated to feveral of thofe topical divinities.
The remains of the 
druidical rites were longeft preferved from extirpation in the defert and mountain- 
ous parts of the country; and there we find thofe dedications by the Romans, 
which clearly exprefs an adoption of the deities worfhipped by the inhabitants.
Thus we fee, that to gratify thofe who ftill held th t fire-rites t and were worfhippers 
of the fun, the Romans dedicated altars to Mithras, and to the fun itfelf : Mithras 
was a Perfian name given to fire and the fun : â€” 
DEO SOLI MITHRAE.
This, at once, points out to us the policy of the Romans, and the accepted religion 
in this part of the ifland, at the time of their accefs, or, perhaps, fome confidera- 
ble length of time after their fettlemenu

John JohnfoHy Efq. lately purchafed the large eftate at Caftle-Steads, in which 
this ftation lies, and has ereCted a handfome manfion for his family refidence, on 
the intermediate ground between the fort and the old houfe.
On the clearing the 
area of the ftation, and levelling the out- works, feveral curious monuments have 
been difcovered, as reprcfented in the annexed plate.
One of the altars is remarkable for its ornament and dedication to Jupiter, and 
the genius or guardian divinity of the place.
â€” A fmall altar to Belatucader adds 
to the number under that dedication, which feems peculiar to this part of the 
ifland; the name, very judicioully, by fome writers, is derived from the com- 
pounds Baal and Cadr â€” the latter a Britifh word, implying valiant or invincible; 
lo that the compound may be read, â€” the invincible or omnipotent Baal.
The 
adoption of the name Baal leads us to obferve, that it is evident, from the feveral 
inflances we have noticed in Northumberland, as well as this county, that the an- 
cient inhabitants of Britain held many of the Hebrew and Egyptian rites and lu- 
pcrftitions, whether brought by the original fettlers, or from Germany with the 
conftant influx of people who muft have come hither from a fhore fo near to us; 
or introduced by the Phoenician merchants, are fubjeefts of fpeculation, and would 
require a treatife from the more learned pen of Bryant, or fome of equal erudi- 
tion.
A fine fculpture of a head, which appears to have belonged to the figure 
fitting in a fiate chair, and probably was deligned for one of the emperors.
It is 
to be lamented that the altar with the bold figure of Hercules has no infeription.
The altar inferibed to Mars, though the characters are faint and fomewhat defaced, 
fhews fufheient to lead us to an apprehenfion, that Belatucader was the fecond 
divinity to which it was dedicated.
On the fragment of an altar is a dedication 
to the omnipotent Jupiter.
The ftation has been ranfacked by Mr. Johnfon, w ho has made a garden on the 
fpot ; the dimenfions were thereby critically afeertained ; in the directions of E.
S. E.
and W.
S. W.
it meafured one hundred and thirty yaids ; and, being of an 
oblong fquare, its width was one hundred yards.
The upper foil, within the walls, 
was turned over to the depth of three feet ; under the ftratum was found to be a 
ftitf clay, on which a thick bed of pebbles and gravel lay, which covered the whole 
area The ground was not examined deeper than the clay, except where founda- 
tions of walls were found, at the S.
W. and N.
E. corners ; thefe were not perfeCt 
enough to difeover what the erections had been : the ground was very irregular 
on the north fide, and the ruins of walls were wholly confufed.
The outward walls of the fort were found to be eight feet in width at their foun- 
dations, faced on each fide with large ftones, and filled with ftones, in an irregular 
order, to the depth of one foot, then aftrong cement of lime and land, of the thicknefs 
of four inches, then a filling of ftones, and fo alternately cement and ftones, in like 
order.
The altars (except the largeft which was difcovered on this occalion) were 
found within the fort, about eighteen inches below the furface of the upper foil ; 
feveral little troughs were alfo found there, with their bottoms turned up : conduits 
were difcovered in all directions, and channel ftones, apparently made for carrying 
off day water.
On the fouth fide, without the walls of the fort, was a large plat- 
form of ftones, five feet below the furface, covering eleven yards in length, and 
eight feet in breadth.

On the ground where the bath was formerly difcovered, nothing was found but 
the pedefial of a column.
At fome little difiance from the fort, the foundations 
of a building were found, and about it a quantity of afhes and fome wheat, the

The fouth-eafi and weft tides have been moated, the north fide is fecurcd by a

It has frequently been obferved,that the little buildings, found Within the Roman 
Rations, were fcattered in an irregular manner, and muft have been the work of 
thofe who fucceeded the Roman poffeflbrs ; for the form and oeconomy of the 
Roman Ration is fo well reported to us, that no apprehenfion has taken place 
with the antiquarian, that the remains we now difeover were the work of that: 
clearing out of this Ration has fhewn us what the firft covering of the area 
was ; â€” a matter, not before, well afeertained.
The platform had certainly led to 
the great fouth entrance.
Afhes and burnt wheat have frequently been found ; 
and it has been doubted whether thefe were the remains of facrifice, or the ruins 
occafioned by fome conflagration.
In the burning of magazines of corn, by a fuc- 
celsful enemy, one would prefume the quantities of aflies, &c.
would be fo confi- 
derable, as to leave no doubts in the minds of thofe, who, even in this diRant age, 
difeover the remains : parched corn will lay in the earth a long time, W'here it is^ 
excluded from the air ; we know that the facrifice of the Romans was a mere con- 
fecration of the animals, by burning the fat and intrails as an incenfe to the Deity, 
and that the carcafles were given to the people for a folemn fefiival : where thefe 
remains of afhes, corn, &c.
have been found, an altar has attended them ; infiances 
of which we fliall have occafion to fpeak of in the fequel: it is alfo obfervable, that 
the buildings, where fuch remains have been found, w r ere too fmall for magazines ; 
and, without wâ€™c conceive that the corn was burnt in the firaw, we are at a lofs to 
conjedture how a large magazine could be defiroyed where thole remains are : all 
which circumfiances lead us to an apprehenfion that thefe are the remains of 
facrifice.

f 2t 
Before we quit this pariRi, we muft take notice of the Roman Ration, now called 
JVatchcrofsy which, as obferved before, is diftant from CaRle-Steads about three 
miles.* It is fituated on the crown of an eminence, of an eafy afeent every way, 
and commands a very extenfive profpedl.
In Mr. Warburtonâ€™s furvey it is num- 
bered the 14th Ration on the wall, according to the Notitia, was called Aballaba, 
and held a detachment only, Riled numerus manforu.m> which gives an apprehenfion 
that it was not conRantly, but only occafionally garrifoned, and ferved as a Ration 
of obfervation in times of more immediate danger.
â€” It is furrounded with a black 
and dreary wafle, of a foil that feems incapable of cultivation â€” there are many irre- 
gular 
are level, laid down in meadows, and are beautiful in that traÂ£t.
The new improved lands will, under 
proper culture, produce moft forts of grain and roots, the foil being various.
Due fallowing, clean plow- 
ing, a pretty large quantity of lime and fome manure, never fail to bring a good crop.
The land favours 
rye, turnips, and potatoes.

Roads.] The military road leads through the centre of this parifh : the occupation roads are new 
modelled, and in good repair.
Wood ] Little wood, except in fmall ornamental plantations.
Game.] Game of all forts is abundant â€” Great flocks of wild geefe winter here.
Ho uses.] The houfes in general are mean and ill conftru&ed, moftly made of clay, and ground floors.

Schools.] No endowed fchool, many fmall ones.
The generous mind muft lament, that learning and confeious re&itude cannot fecure an author from 
public negleft, of which this parifh furnifhes an inftance ; but how much more muft we grieve when we 
find difappointment hurrying fnch a man into difiipation, and that greateft wreck of the human mindâ€”

Housmanâ€™s Notes.
Mr. Jchn Smith, landfcape painter, is a native of this parifh.
When a youth, he was taught drawing 
by Capt.
Gilpin, who was a great lover of the fine arts, after which, he taught drawing in Whitehaven 
and St. Bees, and foon after became the pupil of Mr. S.
Gilpin, the celebrated horfe painter, fon of the 
above gentleman.
The progrefs he made under this mafter was confiderably improved by the frequent 
excurfions he made for the purpofe of ftudying Nature in her different afpedts ; he made many obferva- 
tions among the beautiful lakes and mountains of the north, and fpent much time in their vicinity ; Win- 
dermere, Kefwick, and Ullfwater, have feverally employed his pleafing pencil with the nobleft fubjefts.
About two years ago he painred a fet of highly finifhed views of the lakes for J.
C. Curwen of 
Workington-Hall, Efq. from which engravings have been made, and publifhed under the patronage of 
many 'of the firft charadfers of this kingdom; and will, no doubt, eftablifh his name as an artift.

gular lines and bread-works thrown up on the fou them fide of the hill, at no great 
difiance from the fiation ; they are confufed, and form no certain figure, to afford 
an idea of the occafion on which they were made.
The military way remains 
very difiinvfi.
This appears to have been the fmalleft fiation on the wall, being 
four chains and a half fquare: it was the opinion both of Mr. Horfiey and Mr.
Warburton, that this was in the courfe of the fiations of the Notitia per lineam 
valli, as was obferved of Little Chefiers, in Northumberland.
It is placed a little 
to the fouth of the pretenturas of Severus and Hadrian: the vallum and ditches 
are very diftindl; for, as no purpofe, but merely to rob the wall of its materials, 
could have taken place to deface this camp, it remains very perfecfi ; and the place 
of the praetorium is fiill confpicuous: the whole ground plot is covered with a low 
growth of heath.
Mr. Warburton fays, he was afiured by the country people, 
and had it afterwards confirmed, that they often plow up paved ftones here, and 
thinks part of the high way to Brampton, to be the military w'ay palling near it.
This muft be fpoken of ground at a conliderable difiance, for the ploughfhare has 
left no appearance of its having paffed any way near it.
It is diftant from Bleatarn, 
about half a mile.
â€” The military way going by this fort, has extended from Cam- 
beck, or Carr-Voran, to Stanwix, as a firing to a bow, leaving the wall to run out 
northward, which the road has not attended in this tracfi, on account of the 
marfhes and bogs through which the wall runs.
â€” Thence the fituation of Little 
Chefiers, in Northumberland, and this fiation are deemed fimilar.
Near Bleatarn* 
the wall palfes through a morafs, for a very conliderable way ; and Mr. Warburton 
fays, the foundation here has been made with piles of wood: but there are no re- 
mains to evince this.
Hadrianâ€™s vallum takes a fw^ecp to avoid this morafs; and, 
at its greatefi difiancc, is feparate from the wall ten chains.
Watch Crojs and Stanwix , are feparate from each other fomewhat above five 
miles ; the works lie through a fine cultivated country, for the greatefi part ol this 
rlifiance, and confequently are almoft entirely defaced.
Two cafiella only are to 
be traced in the whole fpace, which do not immediately fucceed each other, but 
appear to be the firfi and lall ; the intermediate ground allowing fpace for three 
more, now totally defiroyed, which would perfectly agree with the order and dis- 
tance of the other cafiella, in the courfe of the wall.
Ce/ituria cohort is Solii / lucinii pofuit.

Camden, fpeaking of this place, fays, â€” â€œ Brampton, a little market town, where 
â€œ is an hofpital for fix poor men, and as many poor women, with a falary for a 
â€œ chaplain ; founded and endowed by the Right Honourable Elizabeth Countefs

This I take to be the Bremeturacum along the wall, for 
" it is fcarce a mile from the wall, where formerly the firft cohort of the Tttngri %

It is not in the additions to the edition of 1722, nor could Mr. Horfley find it, 
but he was of opinion it fhould be referred to fome part near Cambeck, or 
Brampton.* 
The ancient Fate of Brampton, and the fervilities of the cuftomary and other 
tenures of the barony, will beft appear by the inquifition taken in the 31ft year of 
Queen Elizabeth, fet out in the notes.
The parifli of Brampton is fevered from Lanercoft by the river Irthing, except 
for a fmall fpace where Cambeck falls into that river, and then it adjoins upoa 
Walton, Irthington, Hayton, Farlam, and Denton.â€” The bounds of parifhes, in 
this diflriift, are, in many parts, much confufed and intermixed, of which Bramp- 
ton fhews a particular inflance, by Farlam interfering and dividing from the body 
of it the villages or hamlets of Mofs-Row, Silver-Side, Tarnhoufe foreft, &c.
a 
wild and hilly tract extending to Northumberland, though it is afferted by fome, 
that Tarnhoufe foreft is extraparochial.
The parifli is divided into three quarters, 
Brampton quarter, Naworth quarter, and Eaftby quarter.
There is a large old building Handing in a fpacious area in the middle of the 
town, now ufed as a court-houfe for the barony, where court is held twice a-year 
for the fuit and fervice of the feveral manors of Brampton, Irthington, Leverfton,

â€œ The cuftomary tennants, &c.
do claim to hould their tenements as cudomary tennants, for doing 
u their fervice on the borders, and paying their fines and greffomes at the change by death, or otherwife, 
u either of the lord or tennant ; and their faid fines and grelTomes have been fometimes two and fome- 
u times three years rent, according to the rate of the rent they pay for their faid tenements.
As for 
u fuch tennants as come to the pofieflion of their tenements by alienation, or marriage of daughter and 
â€œ heir, they have been accudomed to greater fines and grelTomes, fuch as the lord and they could reafon- 
â€œ ably agree upon.
And alfo concerning the certainty of their faid cudoms, to whom the tenement ought 
â€œ to defeend after the death of any tennant, whether to the heir male or to the heir general, is not known ; 
â€œ for that, in this cafe, the fame hath been fome time allowed the one way, and fome time the other way,

titude of (beep, is placed in a propitious fpot for manufactory and trade ; the in- 
habitants are numerous, and in want of employment, particularly the children; 
there is good water, plenty of fuel and provifion, and every rcquifite, but an ex- 
ample and a generous inftitution.| 
Here are two annual fairs, one on the fcaft of Pentecoft, and the other on the 
Affumption of the Bleffed Virgin, Â§ which occafion a great influx of money to the 
adjacent country.
Not only all kinds of merchandize are then expofed to fale, but 
many (keep and cattle of the breed of the country are marketed at th'ofe times.
â€” > 
Thomas de Multon, Lord of Gilfland, obtained a royal grant for the above fairs, 
and a weekly market on Tuefdays, in the 32d year of King Henry III.â€™s reign.
The eminence, which Camden fpeaks of, called 
THE MOTE.* 
Or more properly after the Saxon tongue (Dor, is worth the travellerâ€™s attention.
â€” 
It is a natural mount, of a fine conic form, in height, from the town, fomewhat 
about three hundred and lixty perpendicular feet it rifes on every fide very 
fwift, and is covered in many parts with fhort heath, Near forty perpendicular 
feet from the crown of this eminence, a ditch is cut quite round the hill, and it 
appears as if the materials, thrown out from thence, had been carried to the fum- 
mit, to form the breaft work there, or increafe its height.
The ditch, in fuch 
places as appear leaft difturbed by the fall of gravel from the upper eminence, re- 
mains near eight feet in depth ; or, more properly, the outward breaft-work is of 
that height: it is near twenty feet wide, and the breaft-work forms a circle of three 
hundred paces, fo that a large body of men might lie here intrenched, for the de- 
fence of the interior encampment.
The crown of the hill is formed into a plain, 
forty paces diameter, defended by a breaft-work ; on its margin, where, we prefume, 
the chief in command were encamped, and the arms and valuables belonging the 
army were fecured.
Whether this was a DamJJofort or not, is uncertain ; for the 
darknefs of the hiftory of thofe times affords us very little evidence of the particu- 
lar adxions of that people in this country.
The Saxon word Mote encourages an 
idea that this was ufed as a parley hi/l or open court for the difpenftng juftice; or 
it might be for the refort of the inhabitants of the town of Brampton, on the in- 
curfton of an enemy.

fuppofed to be Danifh, on the banks of the Tweed, were given in the View of 
Northumberland, and renders it unneceflary to fay more of eminences of this 
nature, wound round with intrenchments, than that the Danifh forts are of this 
form, but generally had three or more arrangements of breaft-works and trenches 
on the fides of the hill.
It is not improbable but the mode might be followed by 
the inhabitants on the borders, and fuch flrong holds made the places of fecurity 
for the valuables, and the refort of the fighting men, when they had to oppofe a 
public enemy.
The mote is remarkably well adapted to the purpofe â€” a man 
afcending could ufe few efforts againfl: an enemy, the fides of the hill are fo fteep, 
and a fmall force, occupying the intrenchment, might defend themfelves againfl: 
a powerful army, who only attacked with miflile weapons, or fword in hand.
The 
crown of this hill commands a mod extenfive profped, fave only to the fouth, on 
which fide it is fhut in, at the diflance of about fix miles, by lofty eminences.
â€” 
To the weft you view the Frith, and the levels adjoining Carlifle: northward 
you command the mountains above Bewcaftle, and a trad: of Scotch country, not 
yet relieved from the gloom and barrennels to which it was configned, through the 
continued warfare of former centuries.
To the eaft you look over a wide trad, 
bounded by the Cheviots and high mountains above the river Reed, in Northum- 
berland.
Dr. Todd fuppofes that â€œ this regular Jlrufture" was at firft <f raifed â€ by the 
Britons, and ancient idolatrous inhabitants ; and that it was defigned by them for 
an open, confpicuous, public altar, or place of facrifice.
â€” But there is no cairn on 
the top of the mount, or mark of fire having been ufed there ; and it is alfo next 
to impofllble, that this mount could ever be forced or raifed by hands.
The idea 
renews to me the poetâ€™s extravagant figure â€” 
â€œ Go level hills and fill up feas.â€ 
The name of Mote , or ODor, leads us to the moft probable conjedure touching 
its appropriation : Du Cange fays of the Mans Placiti , that it was a hill where the 
people aflembled at a court like our aflizes, which, by the Scotch and Irifhare called 
parley hills.
According to Spelman, â€” Collis vallo plerumque muni t us in loco cam- 
pejlriy ne infidiis exponatur , uki con-venire olim Jolebant centurice aut vie in a; incol<e ad 
lites inter fefe trail andas & terminandas.

There are three chalybeate fprings in the neighbourhood of Brampton, one at 
Coatehill, in the vale of Irthington, another at Beckftonegate, in the parifh of Nether 
Denton, and the third, much the moft powerful, at Nook, in the fame parifh.
Game abounds in this parifh and its neighbourhood; there is black game in 
Walton Wood, and upon the mofles large broods of groufe or red game.
The eminences called Knows, are beautifully difperfed over the country, many 
of them planted with wood.
Lord Carlifle, in the courfe of twenty years, hath 
planted many valuable fprings of oak wood, and other foreft trees, not only for 
ornament in the moft pidurefque points of view in the neighbourhood of Bramp- 
ton, but in other places, which are in a very thriving ftate.

At Irthing, or Rule-Holm bridge,* the high fheriff of the county meets the 
iudges of aflize, to efcort them to Carlifle : the under fheriff attends them from 
the boundary of the county at Temon.
Tradition fays, that, as the judges and their retinue could not be properly ac- 
commodated with provifions, on their road from Newcaflle to Carlifle, they were 
under the necefiity of taking capons, &c.
with them.
On thefe they regaled under 
a large oak tree, yet growing on the eflate of John Hetherington, Efq. by the 
road leading from Brampton to Warwick Bridge.
It is called Capon Tree, and has 
apparently withflood the blahs of feveral hundred years.
The unfortunate adventurer in 1745, deluded with vain hopes and poifonous 
adulation, refled at Brampton a confiderable time.
In this parilh was born the late 'James IVallace , Efq. his Majeftyâ€™s Attorney 
General.
His family (the elder branch of which is now extinct) claims confider- 
able antiquity in Scotland, and gave birth to the renowned Sir William Wallace, 
fo much celebrated in the annals of that country.
From Cragie Houfe in Ayrihire, 
the original feat of the family, a younger branch tranfmigrated into Northumber- 
land, and there enjoyed lands of fome extent and value.
By the fault or misfor- 
tunes of his anceftors, a very fmall part of thefe defeended to Mr. Wallace ; but 
the want of fortune was amply compenfated by his induflry and talents.
From a 
common fchool education, which he received at Thornton in Yorkfhire, without 
the aid of wealth, or the fupport of conne&ion, dependent folely upon his own 
efforts, he attained the office of Attorney General ; of which important fituation 
he died poffeffed at the age of fifty-three, in the zenith of his reputation, and at the 
moment when the highefl honours his profeflion could offer, or his country bellow, 
were almofl within his grafp.
Powerful as were his talents, his induflry was not 
inferior, and the compafs and depth of his learning in the law of his country were 
univerfally allowed to have been equalled by few, and were, we believe, exceeded 
by none of his owâ€™n time, who made them their fludy.
To this part of his cha- 
racter he added that which flamped its value upon the whole, without which 
learning and talents are contemptible and dangerous â€” unfpotted honour, and in- 
flexible integrity.
Having married the daughter and foie heirefs of Thomas Simpfon, Efq. of 
Carleton-Hall, he there fixed his refidence.
At his death he left one fon, and 
one daughter, the latter of whom died at Briflol in the month of May, 1792.
The church of Brampton f was dedicated to St. Michael, and is vicarial.

PARISH OF BRAMPTON.
[Eskdale Ward.
Here are not lefs than nine focieties of that laudable inftitution, called 
FRIENDLY SOCIETIES, who fubfcribe to the maintenance of their own lick 
and difabled members, fix for men, and three for women, confuting of about nine 
Eundred perfons in the whole: â€” an inftitution worthy the patronage of the lord of 
the feigniory, and others the firft benevolent characters in the kingdom, which ex- 
tends comfort to the wretched from the hand of Indujlry ; and inftead of conforting 
â– with that fiend Dijfipation , (as is too much the cafe in moft opulent manufacturing 
towns) fupports with its hand that is hardened with toil, and infolds in its labori- 
ous arms, divine Benevolence ; drying up the tears of misfortune and age with the 
tendernefs of brotherly love.
It is to be lamented there is yet little employment 
here for youth; and education, that civilizer of the human mind, nurfe of arts 
and fciences, and fource of infinite temporal profits, as well to the ftate at large* 
as to individuals, doth not fufficiently prevail.
CUSTOMS OF GILSLAND.
The general cuftoms of Gilfland, where lands were not enfranchifed, are for the 
tenants to pay fines arbitraryupon defcents and alienations; but a twenty-penny fine 
only on the death of the lord.
The lands pafs by deed only, with the lordâ€™s allowance 
thereon.
â€” Widows, during their viduity, have a third of the lands of which their 
hufbands died feized.
No heriots are paid in any of the manors, except Nether 
Denton, and if there are no live goods, 40s.
is paid in lieu of the heriot.
An aCl of 
parliament pafied in the 1 2th year of the prefent reign, to impower the infranchife- 
ment of the feveral manors within this barony.^ This is a benevolent aCt towards 
the 
4 Intitled an ail to impower certain perfons to enfrancliife feveral cuftomary lands and hereditaments, 
parcel of the feveral manors of Brampton Farlam, Upper Denton, Nether Denton, Talkin, Irthington, 
Leverfdale, Newby, Aflcerton Walton Wood, Tredermain, Hayton, Cumwhitton, Carlatton, Caftle- 
Carrock, Cumrew, Breckenthwaite, and Newbiggin, within the barony or reputed barony of Gihland, 
in the county of Cumberland, late the eftate of Henry Earl of Carlifle, deceafed ; and fettled to certain 
ufes by the will of the faid Henry Bari of Carlifle, and for other purpofes therein mentioned.
It is to be obferved, that on the late inclofures of commons, Lord Carlifle, who had the redtorial tithes, 
accepted lands in lieu thereof; which will prove a lading comfort to the hulbandman, and improvement 
to the country : an excellent example to thofe who pofifefs the remnants of a corrupt police, â€” the tithes : 
A thing grown into excefs by an abufe of cuCtom ; for the original donors meant not to intail npon in- 
duftry fo great a curfe.
The admeafurement of this once pious gift fhould never have extended beyond 
the original quantum; but, like a fee farm, been fixed upon the land in uniform payment, and not have 
grown to its prefent enormities, under the labours of the broad hand of induftry, and the anxiety and 
l'weat of the peafantâ€™s brow.
Tithes in lay hands are contradidlory and abfurd â€” the ineonfiltency cannot 
be reconciled â€” Whenever they paffed to the crown the great fountain of tenures, they became diflolved, 
and as it were, emerfed and extindl in the greater ellates of the royal character.
Whenever Ends and tithes 
came into the poflefiion of the church, tithes thenceforth became extindl â€” much more fo were they ca- 
pable of extinction in the crown.
â€” It was the device of a corrupt age, and of a debauched and debafed 
legiflature, that gave them the new exiftence to pafs to the lay fubjett.
â€” In the old law it was impoffible, 
and in ancient times never once was conceived, by the mifehief of human invention.

Can it be 
prefumed that men will attempt to advance one degree into improved hufbandry, 
or extend cultivation beyond the ancient mode, when they hold their lands in 
almoft as bafe a tenure as the ancient villianage?
Relatively, thofe cuftomary 
tenures are a national grievance.
From this tenure is chiefly to be attributed the 
vaft and dreary waftes which are found in Cumberland.
It is not want of climate, 
or want of intercourfe with the reft of mankind, binds the inhabitants to the defo- 
late path of their anceftors, but it is the bitter dreg of thefeoadal tenures which re- 
main.
The benign tenure of the ftatute of King Charles, by palling through an 
unpropitious channel, has not ipread its influence over a great part of this county.
The fame fun gilds the valleys of this, as well as thofe of the adjacent counties of 
Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkfhire.
Cumberland, by its fituation on the 
weftern fide of its chain of mountains, fuffers nothing from the chilling vapours of 
the Eaftern Ocean : a more generous and liberal tenure of cflates is all that is 
wanting.^

What Camden fays of

with a violent, rapid ftream by Naworth Caftle, belonging to Lord William 
Howard, but lately to the barons of Dacrej the laft of whom dying young fome 
years ago, and Leonard his uncle choofing rather to try for the eftate with his 
prince in war, than with his neices at law, feized upon this caftle, and got together 
a company of feditious rebels.
But the lord Hunfden, with the garrifon of 
In this parifli, early in the laft century, was born Dr. Guy Carle ton > who after a life of great trouble, 
became at length Dean of Carlifle, and afterwards Biftiop of Briftol, and finally Bifliop of Chichefter, 
where he died in 1685.
He was educated in the free fchool at Carlifle, under Mr. Thomas Robfon ; from whence he went to 
Queen's College, Oxford, on the foundation, and under the tuition of Mr. Charles Robfon, the fon of 
his fchoolmafter.
On the breaking out of the rebellion, he faithfully adhered to the king, and did him confiderable fer- 
vice.
This occafioned him to be ejected, firft out of a rich living in the north, and afterwards out of 
the vicarage of Bucklefbury, in Berklhire, whither he had fled: and finally to be imprifoned in Lambeth 
houfe.
â€” his contrivance to efcape from this imprifonment wa6 curious.
A coid was conveyed to him by 
his wife: with this he was to let himfelf down out of a window looking towards the Thames, where a boat 
was to wait for him.
Unfortunately this cord was two Ihort; but, notwithftanding, he refolved to ufe it, 
rather than remain where he was; and fo, having a great way to fall, he diflocated a bone.
In this con- 
dition the boat carried him off, and he lay concealed till he was cured; to pay for which his wife fold 
the bed on which they lay.
After his cure, he again made his efcape, and went overfeas to Charles the 
Second; his wife and family maintaining themfelves, during his abfence, partly by labour, and partly by 
charity.
On the reftoration, he obtained fundry confiderable preferments.
There is an excellent portrait 
of him in the colledtion of George Allan, Efq. of Grange, in the county of Durham.

Berwick, foon defeated them, putting a great many to the fword, and the reft, 
among whom was Leonard himfelf, to flight.â€ 
The approach is ftriking; the front is ftrengthened by a curtain wall and a 
gateway embrazured, and the corners of the chief ftrudlure on this lide, by lofty 
fquare towers.
Though this was the baronial houfe in later ages, yet it doth not 
appear that it arofe nearly with the time of the Normans; for it is not mentioned 
in any of the inftruments of foundation, or endowment, of Lanercoft: and the firft 
notice that we have of it in record is, that Ralph Dacre, who married the heirefs 
of Multon obtained a licence, in the 9th year of King Edward III.
to make a 
caftleofhis manfion here.
It is again mentioned in the time of King Richard II.
f 
It is the opinion of fome, that the old baronial fortrefs was at Caftle-Steads : and 
the original manfion here moft probably was erecfted fome confiderable time after 
the abbey.
The arms over the entrance are Howardâ€™s and Dacreâ€™s quarterly, fup- 
ported by griffins, crefted with a bull collared, and this motto, fort in loialtie.
Mr. Grofe, from Mr. Pennantâ€™s notes, fays, â€” â€œ On the fouth fide are the arms 
of the Dacres, over the door thofe of the Howards.
The north fide of the caftle 
Hands on the brink of lofty cliffs impending over a rivulet, the defcents cloathed 
with wood.â€ We entered the court by the great gateway, and from thence paffed, 
by a narrow entrance, into an area of equal fides, about forty paces each.
Mr.
Grofeâ€™s defcription is, â€” " That the whole houfe is a fpecimen of ancient incon- 
venience, of magnificence and littlenefs; the rooms numerous, acceffible by fixteen 
ftaircafes, with moft frequent and fundry afcents and defcents into the bargain:â€ 
The entrance into the hall ftrikes the traveller with all the folemn magnificence 
of antiquity.
This apartment is feventy-eight feet in length, very lofty, and of a 
proportionable width.
The ceiling is formed of wood pannels, in large fquares.
and the upper end of the hall is wainfcotted in the fame manner.
The pannels are 
in number one hundred and twenty-nine, on which are painted portraits of the 
Saxon kings, and the fovereigns of England, down to the union of the houfes of 
York and Lancafter, with many noble perfonages : but the.
pictures have little to 
recommend them but their antiquity.
Mr. Grofe, from the account of a corre- 
fpondent who vilited the caftle in 1732, fays, â€” " Thefe pictures were brought from 
Kirkofwald Caftle, when that was demolifhed.â€ The joints of the frame-work are 
ornamented with Ihields, blazoned with the arms of the ancient owners, and of 
thofe families with whom they were in alliance.
At the bottom of the hall is a 
gallery of modern work, which it is prefumed, fills the place of one of greater an- 
tiquity.
In fuch galleries, it was the fafhion of ancient times, on days of feftival, 
to entertain the guefts with mufic, {hows, and mafques : it is now adorned with 
four vaft crefts, carved in wood, a griffin and dolphin, with the fcallops, an unicorn, 
and a bull with a coronet round his neck.
In front is a wooden figure of a man in 
â– armour : two others, perhaps vaffals, in fliort jackets and caps, a pouch pendant 
behind, and the remains of a mutilated priapus to each; one has wooden Ihoes.
Thefe were the Ludibrium Aula; of thofe grofs days.
The chimney here is five 
yards and a half broad.
Adjoining to the hall is another apartment, hung with

We may draw this inference that Nawortb Caftle was not then eredted.

old tapeftry; a head of Ann Cleves, and feveral family portraits, remain there.â€” 
The whole caftle bears the ftrongeft memorials of ancient cuftoms, and the incon- 
venient modes of domeftic life which our anceftors experienced.
The old windows 
are narrow and grated, and the doors almoft wholly cafed with iron, moving on 
ponderous hinges, and with mafiive bolts, which make a harfh and horrid clang 
that echoes in the winding paflages.
The mouldings of feveral of the apartments 
are gilt, or painted â€” the ceilings figured â€” the mantle pieces fculptured with coat 
armour, and the chambers hung with gloomy furniture, the approaches to which 
are without regularity, and up or down feveral fteps.
We entered the chapel, which is below flairs, and formed in a very antique ftile, 
with a pulpit and flails of oak : at the end, oppofite the altar, are clofets for the 
fuperiors of the family attending divine fervice.
The ceiling and altar end is 
wainfeotted in pannels like the hall, painted with portraits of the patriarchs, feve- 
ral of the kings of Ifrael and Judah, and others; in all 58.
A long elevated flail 
faces the pulpit, which perhaps was the place of the chief domeflics ; above it are 
blazoned all the arms of the Howards, with the families with whom they had made 
alliances, or from whom they were defeended : under the fhields of arms the name 
of each perfonage is placed.

the mofs-troopers ; and though he ruled the country with fevere, or rather military 
modes, yet he wrought many happy efforts in the civilization of a race of inhabi- 
tants, as barbarous and uncultivated as ever pofiefled a fettlement in this ifiand.
He kept here conftantly 140 men in arms as his guard.
The approach to his 
apartments was fecured by plated doors, feveral in fucceftion, faftened by immenfe 
locks and bolts of iron, defending a narrow winding ftaircafe, where only one 
perfon could pafs at a time.
The ceiling is figured, and the mantle-piece has the 
arms and motto of the Howards.
We parted along a narrow gallery, 140 feet in 
length, which led to fundry apartments, and were fhewn the library, fiored with 
a great number of ancient books ; it is in a very fecret place near the top of one of 
the towers : Mr. Pennant was mifinformed, for he a fie r ted, that â€œ not a book 
" had been added fince the time of Lord William Howard, in the reign of Queen 
Â« Elizabeth.
â€t Mr. Grofe faid, â€œ There are not above one or two manuferipts 
tc remaining here.â€J In this library is a vaft cafe, three feet high, which opens 
into three leaves, having fix great pages parted on it, being an account of St. Jofeph 
of Aramathea, |j and his twelve difciples, who founded Glartonbury; and, at the 
end, a long hiftory of faints, with the number of years, or days, for which each 
could grant indulgences.
The roof is coarfely carved ; the windows are high, and 
are to be afeended by three ftone fteps : fuch was the caution of the times.
It is 
faid, Lord William was very ftudious, and wrote much : that once when he was 
thus employed, a fervant came to tell him a prifoner was juft brought in, and defired 
to know what fhould be done with him ?
Lord William, vexed at being dirturbed, 
anfwered peevifhly, hang him !
When he had finifhed his ftudy, he called and 
ordered the man to be brought before him for examination, but found that his order 
had been inftantly obeyed : he was a very fevere, but mod ufeful man at that time, 
in this lawlefsplace.
His dungeon inftils horror ; it confifts of four dark apartments, 
three below, and one above, up a long ftaircafe, all well fecured; in the uppermoft, 
one ring remains, to which criminals were chained, and the marks where many 
more were.
Near the library is the oratory, or private chapel, well fecured, where 
Lord William enjoyed his religion in privacy.
The ceiling and walls are richly 
ornamented with coats of arms and carvings in wood, painted and gilt.
On one 
fide is a good painting on wood, in the ftile of Lucas Van Leyden, reprefenting the 
flagellation of our Saviour, his crucifixion and refurreeftion.
Here we found a fine 
piece of fculpture in alto-relievo, in marble, of the crucifixion ; fome tolerable 
pieces of the like work, reprefenting our Saviour faluted by Judas, the defeent of the 
Holy Spirit ; an abbefs with a fword in her hand, attending a crowned perfonage 
falling on his fword ; a monk with a crowned head in his hand, and feveral others

have floors of plafler of Paris: the ceiling of one confifts of fmall fquare pannels 
of wood, black and white interchangeably ; the white is carved, the black plain.
Mr. Grofe, who is very accurate in his authorities, fpeaks of this caftle thus : â€” 
'* Tradition fays, this caftle was built by the Dacres; but by which of them is not 
** afcertained, One of them, (Robert de Dacre) from a quotation in Madoxâ€™s 
â€œ Hiflory of the Exchequer, feems to have been Sheriff of Cumberland, 39th of 
â€œ King Henry III.
and another (Ranulph de Dacre) 14th of King Edward I.
IC Conflable of the tower.
" The firft mention of this caflle is in the reign of King Richard II.
when, in 
** the 1 8th year, it appears from Madoxâ€™s Baronia, that William de Dacre, fon and 
" heir of Hugh de Dacre, who was brother and heir of Ranulph de Dacre, held 
Â£ â€˜ it wiih the manor of Irthington, to which it belonged ; alfo the manor of Burgh, 
f â€˜ near Sands, Lafingby, and Farlam, and other lands, by the fervice of one entire 
ec barony, and of doing homage and fealty to the king, and of yielding to him for 
â€œ cornage, at his exchequer at Carlifle, yearly, at the feaft of the Aflumption of St, 
tf Mary, 51s.

By what feoffment, whether old or new', fays Madox, does not 
tÂ£ appear; neither in what kingâ€™s reign Ranulph de Dacre, anceftor of William, 
â€œ here named, was feoffed ; but it is plain fome anceftor, under w hom Ranulph 
w claimed, was enfeoffed to hold by barony.
â€œ It continued in the family of Dacres till the year 1569, when, on the 17th 
May, according to Stowe, George Lord Dacre , of Grayfloke, Jon and heir of Thomas 
u Lord Dacre , being a child in years , and then ward to Thomas Lord Howard , Duke 
of Norfolk , was, by a great mij chance r jlayne at Thetford , in t'he houfe of Sir Richard

WRITTEN ROCKS ON GELT.
We took our route from Naworth, to view the Roman infeription on the rocks 
of the river Gelt, about two miles from Brampton.
The face of the rock on which 
the

the infeription is cut, is of an angular form ; and being inacceflible, it is only to 
be read by the affiftance of a ladder, or glafs, and that not very corredly, as the.
rays of the fun fall fo, that whilft they aflift you on one fide, they render the other 
more obfeure, by the glare of light on one part, and the increafed {hade on the 
other.
The point of the rock being moft expofed to the weather, in that part the 
infeription has fuffered much.
In the annexed drawing, we have made the cha- 
racters more diftind than they are found on the ftone.
In Camden this monument is thus deferibed, * c Near Brampton runs the little 
â€œ river Gelt; on the bank of which, in a.
rock called Hellbeck, is this graven in- 
â€œ feription, fet up by an enfign of the fecond legion, called Augufta, (poflibly 
** Optio) under Agricola the propraetor; with fome others, of which time has 
â€œ deprived us.â€ The infeription is thus fet out in a plate.

Next 
â€œ to the inferiptions, which are diredly upon the wall, I think it proper ro fubjoin 
*â€¢ the following.
Mr. Camden publifhed it long ago, but not with his ufual ex- 
" adnefs.
It has been lately printed again, in the appendix to Mr. Gordonâ€™s 
â€œ Itinerarium Septentrionale, in a letter that plainly befpeaks its ingenious author, 
ff That copy differed in nothing material from mine, which I took from the origi- 
* c nal, except in the name of one of the confuls; which error in the copy has, 1 
â€œ think, led this learned gentleman into another miftake, with refped to the date 
â€œ of the infeription, which I fhall endeavour to fet right, with all the regard that 
â€œ is due to his charader.
The rock is on the fide of the river next Brampton, and 
u about half a mile above the Gelt bridge.
The firft words of the infeription arc 
â€œ manifeftlv intended for vexillatio Legionis fecundae Auguftte, though in Lieg,

â€œ for Legionis, the I is fuperfluous, of which we have other like inftances.* The 1 is 
â€œ omitted in both the other copies ; no doubt, becaufe the gentleman who look the 
â€œ copies thought it a manifeft error ; but I have rather chofen to reprefent every 
â€œ thing as I found it.
For A.
P. P.
which follow at the end of the fame line, both 
â€œ Camden and the other gentleman have A.
P. R.
and fo at the firft view I took it 
â€œ myfelf, but the fecond time I read it as in the copy ; and prefently thought of ob 
â€œ virtutem appellata, and remembered the confufion of the fame words in another 
â€œ infcription, if that other be genuine.
f But there indeed it was the Ala, and not 
** the Legio, which was fo careful to inform us, that they were called Augufta, upon 
â€œ account of their valor: yet 1 cannot but fufpecft, that OB.
VIRT.
APP.
for ob 
â€œ virtutem appellata, was here intended, however, virt, or perhaps the v, only came 
â€œ to be omitted.
Though it is as eafy to fuppofe an unfkilful hand might here 
â€œ omit one letter, as infert another juft before, that is fuperfluous.
The next words 
<f fub Agricola, are very vifible and diftimft ; but what Agricola this was, may be 
,r a difficult queftion.
The ingenious author of the letter above-mentioned, takes 
â€œ it for Calpurnius Agricola, who was lieutenant under Marcus Aurelius; but I 
â€œ cannot come into this fentiment.
The omiflion of the titles Leg. Aug.
Propset.
â€œ makes me very doubtful that Calpurnius Agricola cannot be the perfon intended;, 
becaufe the omiflion of thefe titles, that are almoff conffantly added, would have 
â€œ been a greater neglecft of the Legate, than the inferring his bare name in luch an 
â€œ infcription could have been a compliment to him.
Befldes, if I am not miffaken, 
<< the cut of the letter L in this infcription, was not fo ancient as the time of this, 
** Legate ; for though there is a good deal of variety in the letters, upon the in- 
â€œ fcriptions of even Antoninus Piusâ€™s reign, yet I think this fhape of an Ldoes no 
<c where appear fo high, as in thofe of his fucceflor, Marculs Aurelius; but that it 
â€œ was in ufe in the later times, is plain from other infcriptions.
I am therefore 
â€œ much inclined to think, that Agricola was the name of the Optio, w ho had the 
t( command of thefe foldiers, who were ordered to work the ftones at this quarry.
â€œ An Optio was a fort of deputy to a Centurion or other officer, who a<fted for him 
â€œ in his abfence.
Reinefius reckons up feveral forts, and different degrees of them.
â€œ Camden, in his copy, has R.
E. at the end of this word, which made me take it for 
â€œ granted it had been Optione upon the ftone; but 1 could not difcern any veftige 
Â« of thefe letters, when I firft viewed the original, though, upon a fecond infpec- 
â€œ tion, 1 obferved a flaw, or impreflion in the ftone, where I fuppofe thefe letters 
â€œ may have been.
This account very well agrees with the obfervation of my fellow 
â€œ traveller, who took notice of the refemblance there feemed to be, both as to the 
â€œ nature and colour, between the ftone of this quarry, and that which the Roman 
Â«* wall, in a great part of Cumberland, appears to have been built, from whence 
â€œ he concluded the ftones muft have been fetched from this place ; which remark 
** I have fince taken notice of in Camden, though at that time I did not remember 
â€œ it; and this looks the more probable from the fcarcity of ftones and quarries 
" thereabout, fo that the people often exprefled their wonder, from whence the 
â€œ Romans got the ftones with which they built the wall in that part ; to this may

" be further added, that the inhabitants near the place, continue to call this the 
â€œ old quarry ; and it is hard to conceive, what elfe fhould have brought a vexilla- 
â€œ tion of a Roman Legion hither, or occafioned the cutting of an infcription upon 
â€œ a rock in fuch a place.
â€œ The numerals IX and X, which are cut upon the rock higher up, as in the 
â€œ figure, and which are very diftind and vifible, though they have not been taken 
â€œ notice of before, are fo like thofe infcribed upon feveral ftones in the face of the 
â€œ wall, that I cannot but think they exprefs here, as well as in other places, the 
â€œ ninth and tenth cohorts of the Legio lecunda Augufta, who were employed in 
" this quarry, and about the wall in thefe parts ; and thefe two cohorts might, 
â€œ perhaps, be employed by themlelves before or after the whole vexillation was 
â€œ engaged in the work.
As to the remaining part of the infcription, I make no 
â€œ doubt but we may read, Apro et Maximo conjulibus , which brings us to the reign 
â€œ of Severus, and the year 207.
It is probable that the uppermoft horizontal 
â€œ flroke in the E, was at firft drawn back beyond the perpendicular ftroke, for a 
â€œ contraction of ET, and we find it in fome other inferiptions, there being a fmall 
<f break of the ftone at the top of the letter.* 
<f As for the word officina , which follows.
Dr. Mufgrave has fo largely treated 
" of thefe officinae or fabricae of the Romans, that I fhall take leave to refer the 
â€œ reader to his comments upon the infcription of Julius Vitalis.
I take Mercatius % 
â€œ or Numercatius , as others read it (though I could not difeern the two firft letters, 
â€œ nor do 1 believe they ever have been there) to be the name of the Prafeftus fabric ce 
â€œ and Fermtus to be either his fatherâ€™s name, or another name of his own.
â€œ Camden takes notice of fome other words on the fame rock, in a more modern 
â€œ character, namely Offiicium Romanorum.
I thought I faw fome veftiges of letters, 
â€œ or confufed ftrokes, which probably have been thefe words; but I could make 
â€œ nothing of them, they were fo defaced : they were near the other infcription, and 
â€œ to the right of it; but whatever occafioned their being put there, they muft 
â€œ doubtlefs, as Camden himfelf fuppofes, have been the work of a later hand.
â€œ I enquired about the inferiptions, faid to have been upon Lenge Cragg, near 
" Naworth, but was tcld that they were now entirely defaced.â€ 
We will trouble the reader with few obfervations, after Mr. Horfleyâ€™s copious 
diflertation.
In the courfe of fifty years fince Mr. Horfley viewed this written rock, 
very little change has taken place ; and from the addition of fifty to fifteen hundred 
years, the infcription cannot be thought to have fuffered much.
The form of the 
infcription is reprefented in the drawing ; and it is not placed in irregular lines, 
as deferibed both by the editor of Camden and Horfley.
The firft word, VEXL.
by lengthening the ftem of the L, though an unufual mode of abbreviating the 
word Vexillatio, takes away the imputation of incorrednefs in the fculptor; and, 
upon a clofe examination with a glafs, we were convinced of its being fo in this 
infcription.
The end of this line, approaching the point of the angle, renders it 
difficult to be made out, being there moft decayed ; the ob is plain, but what Mr.
Horfley makes APP, is very obfeure: and, as we took it, there is a line which falls in 
this

this form W .
If this is fo, then the v, for virtute , is to be found there ; but the whole 
is fo faint, that we muft not infid upon it.
The next lin e,fub Agricola Oplio, is very 
didinft.
Apro et maxima are tolerably legible.
Gonfulibus is generally dark and 
defaced, but ojjicina mercati is didindt.
The w T ord IVL, as reprefented in the 
drawing, is cut in a very fine letter, and indeed feems modern : perhaps placed 
there by fome done-cutter of late date.
The word Romanor is very plain ; and 
we are much furprifed Mr. Horfley fhould defcri'oe it as being defaced and 
confufed.
Mr. Smith publifhed the following infcription in the Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, 
1744, p.
340, and fays, â€œ it was found in a wall of George Wrightâ€™s houfe, at 
â€œ Naworth, where it muft have laid two hundred years at lead, the houfe being fo 
fi decayed with age, that it was neceffary to rebuild it.

THE PARISH OF FARLAM.
L IES in the extreme parts of Gilfland towards the ead.f The church of Far- 
lam % was vicarial, and given by Robert de Vallibus to Lanercod ; at the 
dilfolution it was granted to Sir Thomas Dacre, from whom the late impropriator, 
Mr. Smith, derived his title, who fold it to Lord Carlide.
The following remark 
we think pertinent: â€œ Wherever any of thefe religious houfes, became edabliflied, 
Â« they fwallowed up the revenues of almod all the churches about them ; which 
C{ revenues, at the dilfolution, were not redored to the churches, but given away 
Â« to the kingâ€™s favourites, or fold to fupply his necelfities.â€ There was another 
appropriation of thofe revenues, perhaps as prejudicial to religion and the people, 
their being granted to deans and chapters ; fo that they came to be leafed out, as we 
have already had occalion to remark.
â€œ Farelam hath anciently been a fee of Gilfland ; it was granted by Hubert de 
Vallibus, fird Lord of Gilfland, to one Wedfalan, and afterwards it was granted 
by Lord of Gilfland, to one Walter de Windfore, in King Henry Ilâ€™s 
f The parlfh of Farlam was eftimated, fome few years ago, to contain about fixty families.

THE 
THE PARISH OF DENTON.
L IES in the utmoft north-eaft limits of Gililand, and is now divided into 
Nether Denton and Over Denton.
In ftrieftnefs they are two parifhes.
Nether Denton is fituated in the depth of the vale, and over Denton on the riling 
grounds.
Hubert de Vallibus, Lord of Gilfland, granted Denton to one Wefkop, 
who alienated the fame to Gilles Bueth, whofe fon Robert left iffue two daughters, 
one married to Addock, Lord of Bewcaftle, and the other to Euftachius de Vallibus, 
Lord of Hayton.
In partition, one took Over Denton, the other Nether Denton.
In the reign of King Edward I.
Over Denton was in the pofieflion of one Stonland, 
who granted the fame to one of the Witherington family, in whofe defendants it 
continued feveral ages ; after them it became the eftate of one Tweedale, and 
pafled to the Earl of Carlifle.f 
Over Denton appears to have been anciently a member of the diocefe of 
Durham ; for when Robert de Vallibus, and Robert, fon of Afketel, gave this 
church to the priory of Lanercoft, its appropriation was the adt of Hugh Pudfey, 
Bifhop of Durham .

The Earl of Carlille is impropriator, and receives all kinds of tithes, allowing 
the curate 20s.
yearly; which, with lands purchafed by Queen Anneâ€™s bounty, 
and other dues, brings about 72I.

Nether Denton was the polfelfion of De Vallibus, Lord of Hayton.
It was 
afterwards the eftate of the Dentons, and John Denton exchanged thofe poflefiions 
with Lord Dacre for Warnell.
Since this exchange, it has attended the other 
poffeftions of the Dacres in this barony.

The place in Gilfland where Denton 
Rands is a great deep valley, the Irifh call deep, in their language, Dcen.
Upon 
that Irifh word, the place was called, by the Saxons, Dasin ; and, upon the firfi 
habitation, their Daein town.
There are two Demons there.
Over Denton, which 
is in Northumberland, now the Withringtons lands, and Rands beyond the great 
bottom; and Nether Denton, in Cumberland, late the Dacres lands.
Both of 
them are parcel of the barony of Gilfiand.
â€” The firfi poffeflor I read of, was one 
Wefcop, to whom Hubert de Vallibus, Lord of Gilfland, gave Denton, in or about 
King Henry Il.â€™s time, Wefcop gave it to one Gilles Bueth, or Bewethâ€™s bairn> f 
(otherwife that Gilles Bueth and Bewethâ€™s bairn was but one perfon.) He had 
iffue Robert, fon of Bueth, who died without iffue.
His fiflers were married to 
Addock, Lord of BothcaRre, and to EuRace Vaux, Lord of Hayton, in Gilfland ; 
the one had Over Denton, and the other had Nether Denton, which was the two 
moieties then by partition.
Haytons part was given to John, fon of Robert, fon 
of Aukelin, or Alketill de Denton.
And Robert, brother to the faid John, mar- 
ried the heir to the other part.
The faid Robert fil.
Bueth was their motherâ€™s

Lie gave the church to the houfe of Wederhall; and, after his death, 
David, fon of Jerry, and Robert, fon of Aflcetill, gave it to the houfe of LanercoR ; 
whereupon grew great fuit, till the controverfy was ended by the mediation of the 
popeâ€™s legate, who divided the profits between them, and gave the prefentation of 
the vicarage to the bifhop.* â€¢ 
tc Over Denton, 7th of King Edward I.
was given, by Richard Stowland, and

Housmanâ€™s Notes.
Nether Denton is alfo a cuftomary manor of like fervices as Over Denton.* â€” We cannot forbear re- 
peating our fenfe of the injury done to the country, by keeping up the fervile tenures of thofe cuftomary 
manors, injurious to both lord and tenants.
The Editors.
The prefent Earl of Carlifle has repeatedly offered to infranchife (on liberal terms) all the tenants in 
his refpedlive manors, in the barony of Gilfland ; where there are common lands, to inclofe them, and 
take a certain equitable fhare ; where there are no commons, on the confent of the tenants in general.
Several individuals have lately infranchifed, and others will (we truft) alfo foon perceive the advantage 
arifing from it.
W. R.
Population, &c.] Nether Denton confifts of the following fmall villages, viz.
Chapel-Burn Dixon 
Clugh-head, Birkhurft, Baggra, and Denton Mill, the reft fingle houfes.
â€” There are 55 houfes ; and, 
at 5 to a houfe, make 275 inhabitants.
â€” There are 3 freeholders, and about 30 cuftomary tenants.
â€” The 
regifter begins 1703 : during the firft 20 years there were 160 baptized, 129 buried, 48 marr.
During 
the laft 20 years there were 155 baptized, 126 buried, 42 married.
Poorâ€™s Rate.] They coft the parifh about 51I.

for Latin; he commonly has about 40 fcholars, 
and gets his victuals a certain time in each fcholarâ€™s houfe, gratis, which is called a whittle-gate.
Petrifactions, &c.] Near the Mains, in Over Denton, on the fouth fide of the Irthing, is a fpring 
which petrifies mofs.
Along the banks of the Irthing, in Nether Denton, vaft quantities of petrified 
marine fhells are found, in a band of limeftone, under freeftone.

which conflitute the ferene, the placid, and paftoral: here and there they break 
out into the rocky and fylvan, but chiefly conlift of the tamer nature.
In this parifh was born the Rev. William Re ay, A.
M. the fecond fon of the Rev. Nicholas Reay, 
who was redlorof it from 1718, to 1736 ; then not worth more than 2ol, per annum, but now worth 60I.
The father educated him as long as he lived ; but, on his demife, he was fent to the free fchool at Carlifle, 
from thence he was removed to Queenâ€™s College, Oxford ; where, in 1751, he took his mailerâ€™s degree.
At this place he was fupported by a Angularly benevolent and liberal-minded man, his fatherâ€™s brother, 
Mr. John Reay, who had been the confidential fervant of Dr. Gibfon, Biihop of London.
This John 
Reay retired in old age to Carlifle, where he lived in comfort and credit ; and at laft died whilft on a vifit 
to the Rev. Mr.
Waite, then curate of Rromfield ; from which parifh, it is believed, the Reays originally 
migrated.
In 1755, William Reay publifhed a volume of fermons, under the patronage of Dr. Church, 
to whom he had been curate at Batterfea, till 1745 ; when he was invited to the curacy and ledturefliip of 
Wandfvvorth, under Mr. Allifon ; in which fituation he continued till his death, which took place in 1 756.
Dr. church wrote a preface to Mr. Reayâ€™s Sermons ; in which he recites the occafion of their being 
publifhed ; which was indeed a melancholy one.
Mr. Reay, he fays, had frequently laboured under fevere 
diforders ; but had lately been affli&ed by one more alarming than all that had preceded it, â€” a violent 
effufion of blood from a rupture of the veffels in the lungs.
This rendered him incapable of appearing 
either in the defk or pulpit ; and fuggefled the propriety of an application to the opulent, the pious, and 
the liberal, through this channel.
He wanted but little, nor that little long ; for he died in the follow.- 
ing year.
The fubfcriptions, however, are faid to have been liberal; and conferred in the molt handfome 
manner.
At any rate, and however foftened, there is fomething humiliating in being prefented to the public, in 
forma pauperis.
Dr. Church, whofe happier lot it was to be, in general, at eafe in his pojfejjions, fpeaks 
indeed of his quondam curateâ€™s heavy calamity with great propriety; but he fpeaks as one, who had not 
himfelf been tutored in that bell of all fchools for foftening the human heart, Adverfity ; he fpeaks not as 
one who had himfelf known and felt what it was never to have had any henefce,.
nor assy fortune ; and in 
fuch circumflances to be bowed down by an irremediable difeafe, and rendered unable to earn his own 
bread.
There is alfo fomething fo cold and cautious in Dr. Churchâ€™s manner of recommending the fer- 
mons, as, we own, chills us.
The author, he fays, defires they may be confidered as plain, fenous, well- 
intended, edifying fermons : and the editor is well contented to difmifs them with that character.
The 
fermons, however, have long been regarded, as among the befl in our language; of which the high price 
they have borne, and do ftill bear, is fome proof.
If we were to give a critique on them, we would bor- 
row that, which Iris countryman and cotemporary, Seed, gave of Dr. Waterlandâ€™s fermons.: â€œ They 
â€œ were compofed (as fermons ought to be) with plainnefs and fimplicity ; adapted to the level of common 
â€œ capacities, yet inftrudtive to the higheft.
Free from that obfeure diligence, which fometimes embaraffes 
â€œ the writings of great fcholars.
He ftates each point of duty judicioufly and accurately, explains it 
â€œ happily, and always goes to the bottom of his fubjedt.â€ 
Perfons yet living, who remember Mr. Reay, fpeak of him as an excellent man, and a pleafing and even 
admired preacher ; though, in point of delivery, inferior to many.
We have taken the liberty to mention 
this laft otherwife uninterefting particular, becaufe we have fome notion, it is a trait in the charadlerof 
at leaft a majority of the clergy of the north.
Whether it be owing to the provincialifm of our dialedt, 
of which we never can wholly get the better ; to the total negledl of this kind of learning in our early 
education ; cr to fome conftitutional defedls, we pretend not to fay ; but the fadl is not to be difputed, , 
that our merit, if we have any, appears, as Dr. Byrom fays, not from the pulpit, but the prefs.
In point of fermons, â€™tis confefsâ€™d, 
We preach the worll, but make the beft.
All foreigners allow, that the fermons of the clergy of the church of England far excel thofe of the 
divines of all other parts of the world.
We go ftill farther, and are bold to afiert, that the printed fer- 
mons of Englilh divines contain fuch a body of theology, found criticifm, ufeful morality, and even fine 
writing, as is not to be equalled by any other clafs of writers.
He who wifhes his mind to be ftrongly 
imbued, at once with good principles, and a good tafte for compofition, let him give his nights and days 
to the reading of Englifh fermons.
Among the foremoft of thefe we place thofe of Benfon, Fothergill, 
Seed, and Reay : all of whom, however, it is but fair to own, are faid to have been wretched preachers.

Population.] There are 231 families; all of the church of England, except 3 Roman Catholic?, 2

Population is much increafed within the laft 30 years, owing to the agri-

-â€”The inhabitants are, in general, very induftrious ; a great number of them are employed in Lord 
Carlifleâ€™s colleries, and in carrying the coals to Carlifle market ; they are lately become much improved in 
their manners, mode of living, and drefs.
â€” The eftates are, upon an average, about 30I.
per annum, though 
there are fome from xocl.
to 300I.
particularly Mr. Grahamâ€™s of Edmond Caftle, fituated on the banks 
of the Irthing.
Nature has been kind to it in fituatiort, and art has much improved it; the prefent propri- 
etor having planted a variety of foreft trees, in proper fituations, and made walks through the woods, with 
fifh-ponds of confiderable extent, well (locked with carp, tench, and trout ; all which dilplay the good tafte 
of the propiietor.
About a quarter of a mile diftant from Edmond Caftle, is lituated the village of Hayton, 
in which is a little hill called Caftle Hill, railed about twelve feet above the adjacent ground; it is exaCtly 
round, and, at the top, is one hundred feet in diameter, and hollow in the middle: it is on a rifing ground 
from the caftle, and probably has been a bulwark of defence to it ; but no remains of buildings appear, 
nor has any antiquities been found, to ftrengthen the conjecture; fuch as are frequent on the borders of Nor- 
thumberland.
Heads-Nook, the property of Mifs Dobinfon, of Carlifle, is a pleafant feat, with gardens well

By Netherton, in the parifh of Hayton, near to the ground where the battle was fought by Lord 
Hunfden, about four or five years ago, were found three Jhekeli- (as the country people called them, 
from their fimilarity in form to the ring fixed to the plough beam) of gold : they had been removed 
from a fand bank along with the gravel for repairing the roads, and being picked up accidently at different 
times lying on the road, were all fold to a filver fmith at Carlifle.
They were defcribed as of the 
following form,^^~^*^ plain and fmooth, except the two knobs at the opening ; there was no 
appearance of a tongueâ€™ They meafured three or four inches in diameter, and about an inch and a half 
in thicknefs.
One of them was fold for 7I.
and a larger, it is faid, brought 2 oh â€” Such is the imperfect 
account our correfpondent received of thefe pieces of antiquity, which, we conceive, were ufed as fibulae 
for gathering up a cloak or robe.
Not far from Hellbeck, a few years ago, in cutting down a hollow oak tree, the Ikeleton .of a man wa* 
found therein : he had probably fled for fhelter, at the time of the before-mentioned battle, and being 
entangled there, he could not relieve himfelf.
Some inftrument of iron was found with him.

THE PARISH OF WARWICK.
T HE etymology of this place is not undeferving notice ; as being partly Britifh 
and partly Roman.
It was, as its name clearly imports, and its fituation 
confirms, the place of a Roman ftation, or garrifon; fuch an one as, in their own 
language, they would have called Procfidmm : and was fometimes written Guartwick, 
Guarwick or Warwick .* being derived from Guart, a guard or garrifon, and Wick, 
Vick , or Vicus, a place of habitation, a town, village, or vill.
The Saxons called 
it Warring-wick ; which has the fame meaning.
Camden and his editor proceed in thefe words: â€” " Eden runs by Warwick, 
which I take to be the old Virofidium, f where the fixth cohort of the Nervii formerly 
kept garrifon along the wall againft the Pidts and Scots.
In the laft age (fo faid 
in 1 697) there was built here a very ftrong ftone bridge, at the expence of the 
Salkelds and Richmonds.â€ 
Camdenâ€™s opinion of Warwick being the Virofidium of the Romans is not at 
all fupported ; but, on the contrary, other antiquaries having, with due judgment

placed that flatron in another part, fupported by the evidence of infcriptions and 
monuments.
The bridge of Warwick is a fine ftru&ure, of four arches; immediately above 
which, on an eminence which commands the pafiage of the river, are the remains 
of large bread- works of earth, but of no regular figure, or any other character, to 
lead to the idea of its having ever been a permanent Roman Ration.
The works 
appear like temporary fortifications only ; and, as this part of the country was 
frequently harrafied, as well by the incurfions of the Scots, as the armies which 
our monarchs led northward -agamft the neigbou ring nation, it is not worth a 
travellerâ€™s trouble to fiand at every intrenchment, and fiudy for circumltances in 
difiant antiquity, to explain them.
Ths parifti of Warwick is thus bounded: from the foot of Sawbeck, where it 
falls into Eden below Warwick bridge, along Carr-Syke, through Holme Myre, 
up Pow Maugham beck to the dead water of Eden, and from thence to Sawbeck.
â€” It is divided into two quarters, Aglionby quarter and Warwick quarter.
The 
manor of Aglionby belonged to the late Chriftopher Aglionby, Efq. of Nunnery, 
and now to his filters, and derives its name from Augullon, the anceftor of that 
family, who came into England with the conqueror, and feated himfelf there.

f 
T HE PRIORY of WETHERAL,* for monks of the Benedi&ine order, is 
feated on the weftern banks of the river Eden.
What was left of this edifice 
by the zealots of Henry VIII.â€™s days, was demolifhed, except the gateway, or 
lodge, with a fine eliptic arch, (which is now converted into a hayloft) by the dean 
and chapter of Carlifle, who built a prebendal houfe, &c.
in Câ€™arlifle with the 
materials.
When this was in agitation, Mr. Howard, the late beautifier of Corby, 
offered a fufficient compenfation if they would fufi'er the building to Hand, but 
his propolition was rejected-.
â€” The fituarion is excellent, on a fine elevation above 
the river, to w'hich the lands gradually incline: the adjacent country is fertile and 
well cultivated.
To the eaft and fouth, the hanging woods and romantic fcenes of 
Corby, on the other Tides a variegated and beautiful country: the riverâ€™s banks 
afford many folemn retreats, impending cliffs, embowering {hades, ffcill vales, and.
calm recefies for the refort of the meditative and religious.
The gateway is of plain 
archite&ure, and doth not merit a particular defcription; it furnifhes the traveller 
indeed with an idea, that the monaftery itfelf was w ithout much ornament.
Wetheral was an inferior houfe, a cell to the abbey of St. Maryâ€™s, in York.

When the greater houfes became fuperabundant in wealth, with the increafe of 
riches they added to the numbers in their focieties, and fent forth colonies to new 
and diftant foundations, the lower clafles of which continued fubordinate.

WETHERAL PRIORY.
15.9 
In the compromife of a difpute between the bifhop of the diocefe, and the abbot 
of St. Maryâ€™s, it was determined that the abbot fhould prefent the prior, and the 
bifhop fhould inftitute, and the abbot fhould have the guardianfhip of the houfe, 
upon a vacancy.
One of the cuftoms of the manor appears to have been, that each of the tenants 
of Wetheral fhould carry the abbotâ€™s corn one day in autumn, find one reaper, and 
plough one day for the abbot yearly, carry wood for the filhgarth and mill, repair 
the wear and mill, and grinding corn there, pay a thirteenth portion for muldure.
In the year 1539, Ralph Hartley, then prior, furrendered this religious houfe.

A ledge of the rock,

We are far from conteding the opinions of our predecedors, that thefe remarkable 
cells were originally intended as places of fecurity and retirement.
They might 
ferve as fafeguards to the neighbouring monks againd the Scots: and they might 
alfo ferve as hermitages to fuch of them as either voluntarily chofe to live like an- 
chorites, or were fentenced by their order to do fo, as a penance for the violation of 
fomc of their rules.
But we beg leave to add, from that paragon of antiquarian 
learning, as well as of flocking depravity, Eugene Aram, that they might alfo lerve 
in fome particular cafes, as places of fepulture.
Hermitages were not only places 
of religious retirement, but of burial.
â€œ Here fat foiitary fanduity; and here the 
â€œ hermit, or the anchorite, hoped that repofe for their bones, when dead, which 
<f thcmfelvcs had here enjoyed, when living.â€!
The legendary hidory of them is, that a younger fon of a King of Scotland, of 
the name of Condantine, made thofe excavations, and died there a hermit.
That 
he was afterwards canonized, and the hermitage has preferved his name.
It is probable that, dnce thefe cells were made, part of the rock has fallen, 
where it is condantly wadred by the river; that the whole w r as originally concealed

by trees, much wood yet growing in every chink of the precipice,* and that it was 
lately opened out, in order to be viewed from the walks of Corby.
THE MANOR OF CORBY.* 
Its moft obvious etymology is, as Bullet has exprefsly Rated in his valuable Celtic 
Dictionary, from CWR, which is pronounced COWR, or COR, a brink, edge, or 
bank, and BAY, which, when compounded, is fpelled BEY, a river, or Bream.
So that the etymology of Corby is a literal and exact defeription of it ; viz.
a place 
by the fide of a river, or a precipice over a river.
The fituation of little Corby 
is the fame, and confirms this derivation.
It was one of the dependent manors of the barony of Gilfland.
It became the 
pofiefTion of Hubert de Vallibus, by the grant of King Henry II.
â€œ The manor of 
Chorkby,J in Gilfland hath been, from the conqueft of England, a gentlemanâ€™s 
feat.
It was given by Hubert, firft baron of Gilfland, to one Odard, to whom 
alfo the Earl Randolph gave the manor of Warwick, on the weft fide of the river 
Eden.
Odard had iftue Ofbert and William.
Ofbcrt fucceeded in the inheritance, 
and granted to the houfe of Wederhall the chamber of St. Conftantine, and divers 
liberties in Chorkby, and lands in Warthwick.
Ofbert died without iftue, there- 
fore the manor fell to his brother William, who had iftue John and Robert, by his 
wife Ofuina.
John was eldeft; yet he feated himfelf at Warwick, and let his 
brother Robert poflefs Chorkby.
William, fon of Odard, had iftue another fon, 
named Allan, who was Lord of Langthwaite.
His brother Robert gave him 
lands in Warthwick, and another fon called Ranulf.
â€œ'After Robert, Son of William, fon of Odard, I find one Adam de Chorkby, 
a Knight, and William fon of Roger, and Ofuina his wife, lords thereof.
In the 
23d year of Edward I.
one Walter de Routbury was lord thereof,!
and, in Edward 
IPs time, Andrew de Harcla, Earl of Carliell, forfeited the fame; and in Edward 
Illâ€™s time, Richard Salkeld was lord thereof.â€Â§ 
On the earlâ€™s attainder, Corby having come to the crown, King Edw'ard II.
in 
the 9th year of his reign, granted it to Richard de Salkeld, Kt. whofe defeendants 
* Corby is a mixed manor, partly cuftomary tenure, partly freehold; and a court leet, court baron, and 
cuftomary court, are regularly held.
The cuftomary fines are arbitrary, the rule for afielfing them being 
after the rate of two years improved value.
The cuftomary tenant cannot alien or demife without 
licence of the lord ; and, on difobedience to the cuftom, by demifing without licence, the occupier is com- 
pellable to expend the whole produce of the tenement within the fame.
â€” There are feveral boon fervices by 
cuftom, viz.
one dayâ€™s reaping, one dayâ€™s ploughing, and one cart load of coals carried to the manor-houfe, 
or two carts loaded with peat or turf.
â€” The tenants pay a heriot, and grind their corn at the lordâ€™s mill, 
and render a hen at Martinmas.
The tenants are fubjedf to pains ftipulated in the fchedule of cuftoms, or by-laws, for taking in inmates 
and underfettlers â€” for keeping goats â€” for keeping a brood fow in Corby â€” for Iwine going unbowed 
in the time of harveft â€” for cutting brackens , or fern, in any part of the demefne, or cutting wood.
And no by law made by the tenants, without being confirmed by the lord of the manor, or his fteward, 
ftiall be deemed obligatory.
f We do not find it written Chorkby in any deed.

The church of Wetheral is in the patronage of the dean and chapter of Carlifle, 
unto which, jointly with Warwick, they prelent a perpetual curate, with a falary, 
of 52I.
a year, together with a houfe and fmall piece of ground.
f The parifh is 
bounded by Hayton and Cumwhitton to the eaft, by St. Cuthbertâ€™s, Carlifle, on 
the w'eft, on the north by Warwick, and on the fouth by Hefket in the Forefl.
It is divided into four quarters, Wetheral, Corby, Scotby, Cumwhinton, and 
Coathill, and contains nine villages.
The lands in Wetheral quarter are either 
leafehold, or cuftomary, under the dean and chapter of Carlifle ; the remainder 
cuftomary, with arbitrary fines on death of landlord or tenant, or alienation, with 
heriots, boon days, &c.
â€” Carby quarter is moftly freehold, Henry Howard, Efq.
lord of the manor, â€” Scotby quarter is copyhold, under the Duke of Devonfliire, â€” 
Cumwhinton or Coathill quarter is divided, fome part is leafehold under the Duke 
of Devonfhire, other parts are cuftomary under Mifs Julia Aglionby, of Crosfield, 
William Milbourne, Efq. of Armathwaite caftle, and the dean and chapter of 
Carlifle: there is one freehold, called Wragmirebank, the property of Mr. Rooke.
The church is a handfome edifice, built of excellent ftone, in the Gothic ftile; it 
confifts of three ailes, fupported on three maflive pillars on each fide, and a fine 
Gothic arch divides the nave from the chancel.
The fouth fide of the chancel 
appears to be of greater age than the reft of the edifice; two infcriptions, in the 
Gothic letter, remain there, one over the door, the other over the window, viz.

** The mannor of Combquinton was, at the conquefl:, the lands of Hildred, a 
Knight, to whom the Earl Randolph gave the fame, and William Rufus and 
Henry Beauclerk, a great feignory, and alfo large poflfeflions on the eaft fide of the 
river Eden.
He dwelt at Carlifle, and was afterwards called Hildredus de Carliell ; 
he left that firname to the ancient family of Carliells, who were Knights fuccef- 
fively until Edward Ps time, when their chief feated himfelf in Scotland, at King- 
mount, when King Edward I.
invaded Scotland ; at which time he fold molt of

to make the diviflon equal, was divided into two moieties, which, till this prefent

The inhabitants in general are laborious, and fpare no induflry in the culture of

Improvements of Husbandry.] In Wetheral parifh the flrong foil, if properly managed, would 
produce after fallow, barley, clover, wheat, peas, barley, then fallow; wheat, peas, barley, hay, oats, then 
fallow; barley, grafs feeds, and white clover for pafture.
The light foil, turnips barley, hay, oats, fal- 
low; wheat, peas, barley, hay, oats, then fallow; turnips, barley, grafs feeds, with white clover for paf- 
ture ; or turnips, barley, clover, wheat, peas ; barley, fallow, wheat, peas ; barley, hay, oats, fallow ; 
turnips, barley, grafs feeds, with white clover for palluie â€” After fallow, crops fhould always be reverfed.
The chief property of this method is, that two white corn crops are never found together, which in good 
hufbandry fhould always be the cafe; by a due mixture of crops, the foil is pieferved in good heart, and 
always produces good crops : neither hay nor pafture get time to degenerate.
Every farmer, who 
poflefles 150 acres and upwards, fhould always breed his own flock of fheep and cattle, and feed upon the 
lame farm what he fo breeds: fuch method of breeding and feeding never fails of bringing in the greatefl 
profit.
Shelf.] The wool fhould be clofe at top, and equally broad as at bottom; of an equal furface, that 
doth not fhade nor hang downward, even when wet with rain.
The body fhould be round, the back 
broad, the fhoulders full, and the fore quarters as heavy as the hind, the thighs plump, and the legs fhort.
Cattle.] A co w to breed from fhould have a fmall head, at the muzzle particularly, fine clear fmall 
horns; the neck deep before, round body, and broad rib; wide over the knuckle bone, and wide behind; 
fhort legs, and wide between the fore-legs.
Sheep and cattle bred from thofe of fuch deferiptions, never 
fail of being good feeders.

over a fucceftion of cafcades, at length forms a long canal, fevered by a woody 
illand of conliderable length, and terminated by a ftupcndous amphitheatre of 
rocks, crowned and fcattered over with w T ood.
To the right, the ealy riling flope3 
are covered with meads, firetching up to Wetheral Priory.
The entrance into 
the grotto is femicircular, on the edge of a cliff which hangs over the river, above 
which a precipice, not lefs than one hundred feet in height, lifts up its venerable 
and rugged brow, crowned with oaks of great feature.
You enter into a fquare 
apartment, eighteen feet long, fifteen wide, and of a proportionable height, hol- 
lowed out of the folid rock, lighted by an aperture which commands a view of 
the beautiful canal and amphitheatre before deferibed; from thence you pafs into 
an inner chamber, alfo formed in the rock, eighteen feet in length, and twelve in 
width ; the top of which is beautifullly corniced by red and yellow veins which run 
in the ffone.
This apartment is lighted by another aperture, commanding a view 
of Wetheral, with the adjacent meadows.
On the right hand of the entrance into 
the grotto this tablet is placed: â€”

The efTecft of mufic in this grotto is admirable, the apartments afford a fine echo,

At a little difiance from 
this place, there is an open area, with a bafon in the centre.

Beneath a rock, which pufhes its front from out the trees, on the long w'alk, and 
forms a cool and folemn recefs, is placed the Roman altar, f defcribed in the notes 
to page 69, at the top of which, on a tablet, is infcribed the folemn mementos of 
Shakefpear : â€” 
** The cloud capt towers,â€ &c.
The front of Corby houfe is of confiderable length, and confifts of a fuite of genteel 
apartments; and although it is probable, that this caftle has been the refidence of 
the owners of the manor, ever fince the conqueft ; it bears, at prefent, no appearance 
of antiquity, excepting what is feenfrom an inward court.
Large windows have 
been made in the tower, part of the old building raifed, and confiderable additions 
made to the principal front, which give it the ftile of a houfe built in the begin- 
ning of this century.
â€” It is now a commodious rrranlion, comfortably furnifhed.
In the drawing-room, there is a pi&ure of Charles V.
and his Emprefs, by Titian : 
he is reprefented, informing his lady of his intention to retire to a monaftery, which 
communication does not appear to meet with her approbration.
There are alfo 
feveral other pi&ures of confiderable merit, viz.
an original full length portrait of

a mufician, the work of a Spaniih painter, &c.

THE 
r ns 3 
THE PARISH OF CUMWHITTON.
A Druidical temple lies on an eminence, in the middle of a dark and dreary 
wafte, commonly called King Harry : why it has that denomination, we 
are not informed, othcru ife than by a tradition, that one of the Henries encamped 
here; but on what occafion, or which of our fbvereigns of that name was here, 
there are no relative traces in the tradition or in hifiory to refolve us.
This monu- 
ment goes by the name of the Grey Yauds,Â§ from the colour of the Hones, which 
are placed in a circle, and are to be difiinguifhed at a great difiance, from the 
black mofs earth and heath that furround them.
The number of Hones which 
form this monument, is eighty-eight ; they are but fmall, compared with thofe 
druidical remains we fhall, in thefequel, have occafion to defcribe: the largefi here 
does not exceed four feet in height, from the ground; they are granites of the na- 
tural form, as found on the furface of the earth ; the circle is about fifty-tw'o 
yards in diameter, and to the north wefi point, the largefi Hone is placed about five 
yards from the circle.
We mufi fufpend many of our obfervations on monu- 
ments of this kind, till we come in courfe to that at Little Salkeld, the molt 
fpacious one in this part of Britain.
What is mofi obfervable here, this being one 
of the places for druidical convention, is the barrennefs of the ground; even con- 
ceiving that it was once fur rounded by a forefi, it feems ill placed for convening 
the Hates which were amenable to this jurifdiifiion.
The ground is every where 
rent with torrents, and the deep worn channels are filled with Hones, whilfi the 
intermingled plots, where any vegetation appears, are jufi covered with a fcanty 
growth of heath; we fcarce know a more defolate fpot.
Camdenâ€™s defcription of 
this part of the country is, â€” â€œ To the eafi, a lean, hungry, and defolate country.â€™* 
in getting peats on this wafie, fome years ago, an iron bullet was found, about a 
pound weight; mofi probably brought hither by accident.
The lands from hence rife gradually, and form Hupendous mountains, which 
fill the eafiern boundary of this county; from King Harry, feveral narrow meagre 
vales are in view; the eafiern fide of thefe hills w'e defcribed in the View of 
Northumberland, as we pafied above Featherfione Caflle.
The parifh of Cumwhittonlj is bounded by the river Eden on the wefi, by Corby 
fields, in the parifh of Wetheral, to Headfnook, on the north, by the rivulet 
called Carn, and by Carlatton and Cumrew on the eafi, and by Croglin water on 
the fouth.

pears that Erafmus Dtyden , of Canons-Afhby, in Northamptonfhire, Efq. who was an ancedor of the poet

THE PARISH OF CASTLE-CARROCK 
D ERIVES Irs name, probably, from Cajlle Crag: fome have conceived it to 
have beat the cattle of one Cradock, or Carrock.
This parifh comprehends 
the northern point of that ridge of mountains which extends norih from Crofs- 
Fell, of which we fhall fpeak at large, under the title of the parittt of Kirkland.
Near the village of Caftle-Carrock are the apparent remains of two ancient 
fortifications.
One in a wet meadow field, thirty cr forty yards from the eaft end 
of the church, furrounded by a mote which has been of confiderable depth, (but 
is now grown over with a black moify foil) of an oblong form ; it is about one 
hundred yards in length, and forty-eight in breadth.
In the mote, on the eaft end.
Is a little pool of water of the lame quality as Gilfland Spa, the weeds, &c.
at the 
bottom are perfectly encrutted, as it were with fulphureous particles.
The foil 
within the mote is fomething higher than the marfli around it, is of a black 
gravelly nature, and has been in tillage beyond the memory of man.
The tradition 
about this place is, â€œ That it was formerly an old cattle, from the ruins of which 
â€œ the church was built;â€ and what makes it probable is.
thereare feveral broken 
pieces of carved ftones in the walls of the church.
The other lies about a furlong 
towards the fouth, in a wet meadow ; is about three times as large as the former, 
of afiircular form, and rifes above the level of the furrounding meadow, nearly 
feven or eight yards almoft perpendicular on all fides, except on the eatt, where 
the ground is highett.
The top is quite level, and the foil of a ttrong clayey nature, 
much unlike what furrounds it.
â€˜ It has alfo been long in tillage; and, at different 
times, fome fcabbled or rough ftones have beep uncovered by the plough, but no 
ftones appear on the furface of either of them.

de Vallibus, firft Lord of Gil (land, gave it in Henry II.
â€™s time, together with 
Hayton all'o.
This Euftace gave a carucate of land in Hayton, and another in 
Caftle-Carrock, to thehoufeof Lanercoft; itis called Caftle-Carrock quali caftrum 
de rupe; and wasa-lfo, in Henry II.
â€™s time, the inheritance of one Robert de Caftle- 
Carrock; after him it defcended fucceflively to Robert his fon, and to Richard his 
grandchild, whofe fon Robert was the laft of that name inheritor thereof.
He 
died in Edward I.â€™s time, and left three daughters and heirs, which he begot on 
the body of Chriftian Crookdake, aunt, and one of the two coheirs of John, fon 
of John, fon of Adam Crookdake, viz.
Johan, wife of Thomas Newbiggin, 
â€œ from thence down the ridge dyke of Brackenthwaite to the Ocke-well, and fo to the Weatholme, right 
â€œ up the Weatholme to Brackenthwaite peat rnofs, and fo down the ridge dyke of Caftle-Carrock to an 
u old dyke, and fo from that old dyke to a double dyke next to Carlatton, from thence to a place called 
tl the Great Pitts, from the Gieat Pitts to the mideft of Huckelle molfe, from thence to the Gray-lbone 
â€œ of Langerigge, from thence to the Seatehowe, from the Seatehowe to the Great-well, from the Great- 
well to Gelte, and fo up Gelte to the Cole Lynges aforefaid, where the fa d bounder firft began.â€ 
Soil and Appearance.] The arable land is light, and fo full of blue ftones, that when harrowed, it 
appears to be nothing but a bed of ftones ; yet, by their attraftion of moifture, the beft crops are produced 
â€” The high fell or common is rugged and barren ; but the lower moor being dry, and covered with a fine 
herbage, affords good pafturage.
The (heep are computed at 2000, of black cattle 300 head, and about 
340 horfes.
â€” Much of the cultivated land lies in town fields, doled out in ridges ; a great impediment to 
agriculture.
Produce.] Befides the grafs grounds, chiefly barley, rye, and oats; fome wheat near the bafe of the 
mountain, where the foil inclines to clay.
.â€”Here are fome patches of wood, and hedges.
Lime.] Burnt here in great quantities.
Game.] Groufe on the moors, and on the tarns wild-ducks.
Inhabitants.] From their intercourfe with colliers, lime-burners, and carters, have ffiaken off that 
fimplicity of manners v'hich marks the hulbandman, and they have eontra&ed a familiar roughnefs and 
aufterity, together with a low fubtlety, which too often borders on fraud and deceit ; effeemed an 
accomplilhment.
School.] Not able to maintain the teacher â€” he has a fqnall property of his own.
Rents.] On an average 1 8s.
per acre â€” increafed beyond its intrinfic value, by the number of workmen.
Tenures.] There are two freeholds, the reft cuftomary tenements.
Tithes.] Paid in kind.
The tithe wool laft feafon fold for 8s.

â€” I took the 
height of the mountain, and find, by the falling of the barometer, that it.
will be about 300 yards per- 
pendicular above the level of the village of Caftle-Carrock.
Cattle and Sheep.] Sheep are bred on the commons, to a confiderable number yearly, and fome are 
fed there to a good ftate of iatnefs.
The cattle are of the Cumberland breed.â€” Horfes are fmall, of 
the Scotch kind.
â€¢ Antiquities.] Two cairns, one of great magnitude, called Hefpeck-raife, on the fummit of the fell.' 
About the, year 1775, a farmer removing a large cairn of ftones, near Gelt bridge, in this parifh, found a 
human fkeleton in a fort of coffin made of ftones; â€” and, from fome myfterious expreffion of the farmer, 
and a fudden and vifible alteration for the better in his appearance and circumftances, it is generally be- 
lieved that he found there fome thing of confiderable value.
Infcription on the bell, â€œ Praife thou the

Prospects.] Admirable from the fummit of Caftle-Carrock fell, commanding all the moft fertile part 
ef Cumberland, bounded by remote hills in Scotland to the north, the Irifh fea to the northweft, the 
mountains of Skiddow, Saddleback, & c.

mountains towards the north-eaft â€” Solway Frith fpreads out a ffiining lake, indented by many promon-

â€” To the weft of the church 300 yards, there is another.
In the common fields, weft from Cumrew, was lately difeovered a human fkeleton, Inclofed in a fort of 
coffin of rough ftones ; a fmall cairn, or heap of ftones; covered the fepulchre.
â€” A cairn was lately open- 
ed in the eftate of John Gill, Efq. of Cumrew, and an urn was found therein, inclofed with broad ftones, 
and lecured with one laid over the top.
The urn was broken, and parts of it carried away by the neigh- 
bours, Mr. Gill having fecured only the bottom of it ; the urn was of pottery, curioufly carved on the

It con ained a black mould.
A circular inclofure of ftones, with a large cover, was lately opened here, the contents only a few de- 
cayed bones, without any urn.
In making a ditch in Mr. Gillâ€™s eflate, a number of filver pieces were found ; but the impreflions were 
Hot underftood by any perfon who faw them.

It is faid to contain 1 600 acres of arable land ; but has few inha- 
bitants.
It is very remarkable, that it hath had no parifh church for feveral ages, 
and it is only known by tradition where the church flood.
The manor belongs to the Earl of Carlifle, as lefTee of the crown; with which 
the Earl holds GeltfloneForefl; it has palled through various changes of polTefTors.

This and the adjoining forefl of Breirthwaite f were given to the priory of 
Hexham ; and, at the diffolution of that houfe, were granted to the barons of 
Gilfland.
This may be the reafon of their being confidered as extraparochial â€” 
Breirthwaite Forefl, otherwife Tarnhoufe Forefl, is now confidered as part of the 
parifh of Brampton ; it is alfo called Tindale Fell, or Tindale Forefl, probably 
from Adam de Tindale, who granted much property to the priory of Hexham.
Climate.
J Dry, cold, and healthful.
Road.] The road between .
Penrith and Brampton lies through it.
River and Fish.] In Cam rivulet, cn the wellern border of this parifh, are trouts of the moll 
delicious flavour.
School and Poor.] None: 
Antiquities.] The ruins of the church to be difcovered.
â€” A cairn on Saugh-tree-gate farm.
About ten years ago, in ploughing a field in Lord Carlifleâ€™s eflate, at Low-Hall, a number of coins 
were turned up, fuppoled to be Roman ; but not falling into the hands of any perfons fkilful in their 
value, they were thrown afide, and loft by the children.
This eftate was commonly called Hallâ€™s eftate, 
and was in the family of the Halls for feveral generations, but was purchafed by the Earl of Carlifle, 
about twenty years ago.
Their deeds (but from whom we cannot learn) were for every third foot of 
Carlatton, with grafs for twenty ewes and their followers.
But Lord Carlifle letting Carlatton in feparate 
farms to plough, the farmers began to difturb and diive away Hallâ€™s cattle, upon which Hall made com- 
plaint to Lord Carlifle, then at Naworth Caftle, who ordered Mr. Knowles, his fteward, to hedge off as 
much land as would fatisfy Hall for his right on Cailatton, which the family enjoyed till the earl pur- 
chafed it.
Plantations.] Within the laft twenty years feveral plantations of fits have been made, which thrive 
very well ; and are both an ornament to the place, and afford fhelter to the cattle, &c.
from the helm- 
vends, which frequently blow here with great violence.

THE PARISH OF AINSTABLE.
H ERETOFORE fpelled Aynftapelith , Eynjlable, (fo pronounced by the prefent 
inhabitants) or vlinjlable , is we apprehend, of modern, or at moft of Saxon 
derivation, implying either a place of falc or fair, as Staple : or a place for horfcs, 
as Stable , Aina, dins , or Eynen is one ; unions , quidam.
This parifli is bounded by the parifhes of Cumwhitton, Flefket, and Kirkofwald.
Denton fays, â€œ Ainflaplighe is a manor and townfhip on the fouth lide of Gilfland, 
divided from that barony by Northfkeugh Beck, and reached from the river Eden, 
on the well, up caftward into the mountains, and bordereth upon Staffol lordfhip 
toward the fouth.
It containeth Ainflaplighe, Rucroft, and the Nunnery, which 
Nunnery was founded by William Rufus.
This feignory and other lands in 
Cumberland, King Henry I.
gave to Adam, fon of Swene aforefaid, from whence 
it defcended in King Henry II.
â€™s time to William de Nevill, whofe lands in Cum- 
berland, in the reign of King John, were in the holding of Roger Montbcgon, 
Simon, fon of Walter, and Alexander de Nevill.
In King Henry III.
â€™s time, Ain- 
ftaplighe lordfhip became the inheritance of John MufTey, Henry Terrily, Michael 
de Vaux, fon of David, and others.
About the year of our Lord God, 1239, and 
in the latter end of that kingâ€™s time, William Boyvill, of Thurfby, Knight, was 
lord thereof, and held the fame of Richard Nevill.
When he died, it fell to his 
fon, John Boyvill, whofe brother Edmund fold Ainflaplighe to Andrew de Harcla, 
who forfeited it to the king, who gave it to others ; and from them to John Den- 
ton, of Cardew, fon to Sir Richard Denton, whofe pofferity, William, William, 
and John Denton, enjoyed it as lords thereof fucceflively from father to fon, until 
Thomas Lord Dacre extorted it from the faid laft John Denton, in the time of 
Henry VI.
for that the faid John Denton was towards the party of King Edward 
IV.
â€” which tyranny of the Dacres God feemed to revenge : for fhortly after the 
faid Lord Dacre, and Randal his fon, were both flain at Towron Field, or drow ned 
in the river at Ferrybriggs, in Yorkfhire, where King Edward got the vidtoi y againffc 
Henry VI.
and thereby the crowm of England.
Afterwards the Lord Humphrey 
Dacre, by marrying with dame Mabel Parr, daughter of the kingâ€™s favourite, re- 
covered the Dacres lands, and ftill kept Ainflaplighe by his fatherâ€™s pretended 
right, and fo did his pofferity, until all their lands fell to the crown by attainder.â€™* 
Within this parifli are two confiderable manors â€” the manor of Ainffable is the 
property of the Earl of Carlifle: it defcended to the family of Howard, from Lord 
William Howard, who obtained it by his marriage with one of the coheireffes of 
the Lord Dacre of Gilfland.
There are many eftates held under it, that are fub- 
jedl to the payment of yearly cuffomary rents and fines certain; and others by the 
payment of yearly free or quit rents.
â€” There is a fifliery on the river Eden, both 
w ith the rod and boat, of w hich Lord Carlifle poflefles two thirds, and the owner 
of Nunnery the remainder.
The manor of Ermathwaite, in the parifli of Ainftable, is held under the houfe 
of Nunnery; is a manor paramount; has rents, fervices, ward, and fines, both 
certain and arbitrary, with this further privilege, that not only the demefne itfelf,

VIEWS ON THE RIVER EDEN.
In palTing up the river, near Armathwaite bridge, is a fmall country feat be- 
longing to the family of Richardfon, of Bifhopâ€™s-Yard in Penrith, where, by a 
little afliftance to Nature, a beautiful terrace is formed on the fummit of the cliffs 
overhanging the river, near half a mile in length : on the one hand a plantation of 
larches and flowering fbrubs, on the other a fine hanging grove, fufpended from

The views from this terrace, though not extenfive, are pidturefque : 
a curve of the river, over which is an elegant fione bridge of four eliptic arches, 
is a pleafing feene : the diftant back ground is fpread out in brown and heathy 
mountains, giving an excellent contraft to the colouring of the nearer landfcape.
You look down upon the fweet retirement of Armathwaite Caftle, covered with 
hanging w oods, the eminences planted with firs.
Of this place we fhall have oc- 
cafion to give a fuller defcription in the courfe of the work, To the fouth you 
command the courfe of the Eden up to the bay, where the whole river falls over a 
â€¢wear, or dam, near twenty feet in height, and two hundred yards in length, in a 
cafcade of fpouting flreams, in various diiedtions.
This wear is chiefly natural, 
and formed of perpendicular rocks ; but, in order to make it a complete lock for 
taking falmon, it is framed from fhore to (bore with timber, by which the whole 
ftream of the river is diftra<fted and broken in a moft beautiful manner, from 
thence the river rufhes, in troubled volumes, along the rocky channel.
Above the 
wear is a placid and ff ill bafon of water to the very brink of the frame-work.
On 
the eaft fide in the Cooms are lofty hanging woods, the property of Lord Carlifle, 
which abruptly fhut in the profpedt; to the weft irregular grounds, ftretching up

The grounds to the fouth-weft

The late proprietor, Chriftopher Aglionby, Efq. attending to the natural beauties 
of the liiuation, formed walks on the banks of the rivers, and through the woods, 
where 
an enterprise, it is true, are but few, and one cannot expert, for that reafon, any enlarged account.

would be able, methinks, to detert fomething of the rank, office, and departments of 
the feveral deities, which I (hould hope might be in fome meafure difeovered by the etymology of the 
names, and the terms and circumflances of the refpertive inferiptions.
â€œ The little holes like points which appear upon this Hone, among the letters, and break the order of 
the words, are not any natural faults in the block, nor were they put there by any later hand, in order to 
facilitate the reading of the infeription, which they rather incommode than further, but are intended in 
reality, awkward as they are, for ornament ; and the like appearances occur in the infeription, publiffied 
in your Magazine of 1753, p.
225, and it is certain that the like dots are very frequent upon the old 
coins, and for the fame miftaken reafon.

The names Durio, Ratnio, Trupo , and l.urio , which are nominative cafes, are, I conceive, Britiffi, with 
a Roman termination.
That they are Britiffi, I infer from the name of the god Maponus , to whom 
their vow was partly performed.
They were four brothers (for that I take to be the meaning of the 
word germani ) and ferved in the Roman army againft their common enemy the Pifis and Sects.
And 
when one obferves the Britiffi god Maponus joined in this infeription along with the Numina or Ntintcn 
Aagujli , one cannot but admire with what facility the ancient idolaters adopted one anotherâ€™s deities.
The Greeks admitted deities from Aft a and Egypt, and even unknown gods.
The Romans 3ffociated the 
gods and goddtfTes of Gieece and Egypt with their own ; and the Britons you fee here had no objertiou 
to ranking the deities of Rome with theirs.
As to the perfon here Riled Augujlus, â€œ It was probably Antoninus Pius, as I judge from the form 
of the letters, on which occafion however I (hall not repeat what I formerly remarked in your Mag. of 
1753, p.
515, but thither refer you.â€ (Signed) P.
Gemsege.
That it is much eafier to pull down than it is to build up ; and eafier alfo to find fault with the labour* 
of others, than to produce any thing of our own more fautlefs, are no new' obfervations The conjertures 
of thefe gentlemen, we own, are ingenious ; but whilft they are offered only as conjertures, we hope it ia 
no prefumption in us to fay, that they do not fatisfy us ; and to offer, in our turn, fuch as feem to us to 
be at lead more plaufible.
The ftone is neatly cut, and the infeription entire.
Yet the form of the letters is fuch, that they may, 
or may not, be as our predeceffors have read them.
We think, the firft word is not to be read Mapona , 
becaufe, neither in the Celtic ( Britiffi ) or Roman languages, can we, after all our rcfearches, find a word 
or fyllable that bears the moft diftant refemblance to Mapo.
We do not take upon us to affirm that 
there never was fuch a Britiffi deity as Map or Mapo : it is barely poffible there might.
Such deities 
wâ€™ere eafily made and named.
But the form and ftrurture of the letteis will admit of being read AM, as 
naturally and as well as MA, and may be two words alfo ; or, as we rather think, one compound word, 
formed of two of very different fignificat : ons.
AM, Baxter, who, on thefe fubjerts, is always great and 
at home, fays, it is the fame radical Gauliffi or Celtic word as AV, from whence Avon, a liver, comes, 
and as frequently and generally ufed to denote, not a river, but a mere or lake.
In all infant and imper- 
fert languages, nothing is more common than the convertibility of letters, or an appaiently arbitrary fub- 
ftitution of one for another.
We could produce fundry inftances, in which PON is the fame as MON, 
fignifying a mountain.
Hence Deo Ampono, is, literally to the god of lakes and mountains : a god fo pe- 
culiarly local and appropriated, that if the heathen mythology were not now happily reprobated, we could 
not well hit on a more appofite attribute for a god of Cumberland.
The Romans, we know, were particularly addicted to the Latinizing of words in other languages.
But 
whenever they did fo, their termination was, as it ought to be, us, and not 0.
Hence we infer, that Durio t 
Ratnio , Trupo , and Lurio, are not, as Mr. Gemfcge thought, nominatives, but datives; and put in oppo- 
fition, as it is called, with Numinibus .
â€” It is hardly neceffary to remark, that Numen, which Teftus in- 
terprets to be quaf Nulus Dei , has an inferior import to Deus ; meaning rather the attribute or exertion

where he might enjoy the romantic fcenes.
You traverfe through two or three 
meadows before you enter the wood that fringes the border of the rivers.
After 
pafling groves of noble foreft trees on one hand, and infant plantations on the other, 
a fine theatre prelents itftlf, clofed on every fide by ffupendous rocks, cloathd 
with woods, whilft the river Eden, in broken ftreams, winds through the .ale.
On the banks of Croglin water, the road is gained by cutting away the rocky 
points in fome places; in others, by excavating the projecting cliffs.
Here the 
foreft rifes beautifully fhade above fhade; not crowded with brufhwood, but the 
long Items of ftraight and lofty trees form a fylvan colonade.
As you proceed 
up Croglin water, the vale ftraitens, the cliffs increafe in eminence, and hang 
over your head in a tremendous manner, their Tides and fummits fupporting 
noble oaks : here the water falls down a fine declivity, not To as to give lurprife, 
but placidly flowing over each fhelving rock; and, little agitated, glides away, 
till it murmurs through the pebbly channel.
As you advance, the noife of a

The 
feene is noble and folemn ; branches of trees arc flretched and mingled from 
precipice to precipice.
The water gufhes in one entire fpout through the parted 
rock.
Every flep you proceed from this point has new and excellent beauties.

The found of water-falls firikes the ear on every 
hand ; on the path (made by a vafi: flight of fleps) unexpectedly turning round a 
point of the rock, you inftantly fiand on the brink of a deep abyfs, where the 
water is precipitated thirty-five perpendicular feet, into a bafon of eighteen feet 
in depth.
Language deferibes fuch fubjeCls weakly, and communicates but a 
of power in fome deity, than deity itfelf ; fomething of a fubordinate god, or a divinity, as we might 
now exprefs ourfelv; s.
As applied to Auguftus, numinibus means his tutelar deities, his lares or penates ; 
confidering him as a Roman; but confidering him as connected with Britain, the colony in connexion 
with their brethren the Romans, thought fit to join alfo his Britifh tutelary deities ; a fort of allegorical, 
imaginary perfonages, created perhaps fer this efpecial purpofe.
Tru is fynonymous with dru or drud , and implies a valiant, firm, powerful friendihip: one fenfe of 
d<wr or dur is feel, whence the Latin durus ; lu, whence luriut , is a band or troop, with the additional 
idea of impetuofity or fiercenefs ; ram is limply elevation, grandeur, or magnificence, either of perfons or 
things : and hence the Indian idol ram ; and ill Hebrew, rom implies loftinels or fuperiority.
Thefe 
radical Britilh words, put into the Roman mint, by Romanifed Britons, could not but be materially dif- 
torted from their original form ; ftill a tnanifeft refemblance is to be traced.
Inftead of German/, and 
the far-fetchcd fiction of four brothers, we would read, the following letters thus, Colonia et Romani , &c.
The whole infeription will run thus : 
Deo Ampono; et Numinibus Augufti, Durio et Ramio et Trupo, et Lurio, Coleuia et Romani Votum 
fives unt lubentes merit's .
It is probable, the Auguftus here mentioned was, as Mr. Gemfege fuppofes, 
Antoninus Pius ; in whofe reign, we know, there was a formidable revolt of the Brigdntes : which he 
fupprefled with but little lofs of blood ; molt probably, through the interference of fome of their own 
partizans ; by fome of whom, on occafion of this pacification, it is not unnatural to fuppofe.
this altar 
might be eredted.
And by this public and dexterous incorporation of Roman and Britifh divinities, their 
attachment and fidelity to the Romans was manifefted ; at the fame time, that due court was paid to 
the natives, by a proper refpeft being (hewn to their divinities.
We fuppofe fome companies or bands.
of the Brigantes themfelves to have taken part with the Romans againll their revolting countrymen ; and, 
on their fuccefs, to have been llationed here ; and here, on that occafion, to have ere&ed this altar.
This 
fuppofition, we flatter ourfelves, gives a fignificance and illuftration to the uncouth words Diuius and 
Ramins and Trupus and Lurius, whether we read them exactly right or not, which is not to be found 
in any other interpretation.
But though we have certainly taken fome pains to come at the true fenfe 
of this piece of antiquity, we are far from being confident, that we have fucceeded.

We owe to the former, that, in a dark and barbarous age, 
all literature was not wholly loft ; and to the other the prefervation of that purity, 
elegance, and delicacy of manners, fo peculiar to the fex ; which is of more mo- 
ment in forming national manners, than fuperficial obfervers may perhaps 
imagine.
It ftiould not be forgotten, moreover, that when it was the fafhion of the 
age to build and endow monafteries and nunneries, as it has ftnce been to build 
holpitals in a ftile of magnificence, and with rich endowments, hardly inferior to 
the proudeft and richeft of our ancient monafteries, one vifible and ftriking good 
effect very generally flowed from them: the kingdom was not then over-run with 
beggars and malefadors ; nor oppreffed with an heavy national debt, and an in- 
creafing poor rate, which is without a parallel in the hiftory of the world.
In Mr. Goughâ€™s edition of Camden, on the authority, we prefume, of N.
and B.
we are told that, â€œ upon a bedâ€™s head at Nunnery, called the Nunâ€™s Bed, was this 
â€œ infeription â€” (See the engraving ,) â€” Our hiftorians have not informed us when 
or where this bed w'as to be feen at Nunnery.
We made inquiry on the fpot for 
this rare piece of antiquity ; but w ere aflured by the lady of the family, as well as 
by Mr. Aglionby, that there was no fuch thing about the houfe; nor had ever 
been, as far as they knew'.
At a diftance, on the riling ground, to the north eaft of the houfe, in a field 
called Crofs Clole, is an upright pillar, which, with laudable care, has been repair- 
ed: on one fide is a large oval ftone, with a crofs in its centre, and the following 
date and letters around it, as reprefented in the cut.
The figures are clearly modern : and, indeed, we were in- 
formed, were added about the beginning of this century, 
merely to record the foundation of the nunnery.
W e com- 
mend the zeal of the perfon who inf'erted this date; as it 
proceeded, no doubt, from his great refpedt for this once 
venerable place.
We ftill more commend his integrity, in 
his caution not to miflead by counterfeiting ancient cha- 
racters : ftill w^e cannot but d.eem it bold and hazardous, in 
any way, to tamper with really ancient monuments ; be- 
caufe it is hardly poflible to do it without exciting fome 
degree of fufpicion.
A w'ooden cut of this monument was 
__ publifhed, under the fignature of Lazenbyenjis , in the 
Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine, for 1755: on w hich Mr. Pegge, under his ufual fignature, 
made fundry learned and pertinent remarks in the fame repofitory, which we 
tranfenbe and fubjoin â€” â€œ The infeription has a relation to the ancient fanduaries, 
as the word fanttuarium upont it clearly expreffes, and I fhall here endeavour to 
illuftrate it accordingly.
The fanduaries were places of refuge, in the times of 
popery, where, if a malefador arrived, before he was apprehended, he remained 
there fafe and fecure againft all the attempts of his purfuers.
My notion farther 
is, that thefe fanduaries w'ere different in different countries, thofe in Spain for 
example, varying in fome certain refpecfls fjom thofe in France, and the afylums 
in France, difagreeing in like manner from ours here in England.

Â« ourfelves therefore to England, ours were chiefly retrained to churches; and in 
the church of Beverley, in the county of York, which was once one of the mod 
eminent of thefe privileged places, there was a done chair, wherein the malefactor 
was to feat himfelf, and thereby he became entitled to the protection of the place.
See Spel manâ€™s Glolf.
vv.
Sanciuarimn & Fridfioll.
But how came pillars, you will 
afk, to be concerned in this affair, fince, though we read of thefe chairs, we meet 
with nothing about pillars being fo privileged ?
Now, it is true, the pillars them- 
felves were not dignified with this high prerogative; but neverthelefs they had 
relation to the privilege in another refpedt.
For it mud be obferved, that the 
privileges of thefe churches depended upon charter, by which means fome churches 
and monaferies (for monasteries are likewife intereded in the affair) had more 
extenfive rights than others.
At Beverley it was the Fridfioll , or done chair, that 
enjoyed the privilege, and in other places it was the church in general, (and indeed 
I fuppofe there was a time when all churches were endowed with the power of 
protecting criminalsf) and in others the privilege extended to a certain didancc 
from the religious houfe.
Now pillars being anciently ufed for the purpofe of 
marking out boundaries, and more particularly in this kingdom, where the ftone 
croffes had fo great a refemblance of pillars you will eadly conceive fuch privileged 
did riels would be very properly bounded and denoted by the erection of a few 
fuch pillars.
And to this effect, I will here cite you a remarkable paffage from 
Mr. Sravelyâ€™s Kidory of Churches, p.
173, where, fpeaking of the monadery of 
Haguldad,Â£ that is Hexham, in Northumberland, he fays, " there were four 
erodes fet up at a certain didance from the church, in the four ways leading there- 
unto: now if any malefactor, dying for refuge to that church, was taken or appre- 
hended within the croffes, the party that took or laid hold of him there, did forfeit 
two hundredth.* If he took him within the town, then he forfeited four hundredth; 
if within the walls of the church-yard, then fix hundredth; if within the church, 
then twelve hundredth; if within the doors of the quire, then eighteen hundredth, 
befides penance as in cafe of facrilege ; but if he prefumed to take him out of the 
done chair, near the altar called Friddoll, or from amongjd the holy relicks behind 
the altar, the offence was not redeemable with any fum, but was then become Sine 
emendatione , Botolos,<} and nothing but the utmod feverity of the offended church 
was to be expected by a dreadful excommunication,|| beiides what the fecular power 
would impofc for the prefumptucus mifdemeanor.â€ 
" There were croffes, it feems, at Hexham; and fo you obferve, that this pillar 
in queftion has a crofs upon it, in fo much that it may be termed either a crofs or 
a pillar at pleafure.
Of thefe croffes there were four, becaufe there were four 
ways or roads to that monafiery, from whence one may infer that the number of 
the pillars or croffes to be eredted would depend, in all cafes, on that of the ways 
leading to the place; and probably there was formerly more than one here at 
Nunnery, though only this which is now under confideration has efcaped the 
ravages of time.
Upon the whole I think, it is evident enough that this pillar or

crofs was the boundary of the fandluary at Nunnery, that way, or towards that 
point of the compafs in which it (lands.
â€f 
â€œ But had Nunnery then this large and extenfive privilege?
I think it had: the 
privilege, I remarked above, depended upon royal charter; and at Armathwaite, 
a Benedictine nunnery was founded by William Rufus, in the 2d year of his reign, 
which falls in with the year now to be feen upon this pillar, to wit, 1088.
And 
this nunnery at Armathwaite, I prefume, was no other than this feat of Mr.
Aglionby, which frill retains the name.
It is remarkable, that the letters of the 
word SanEluarium being partly Saxon, accord very well with this date.
And unlefs 
the date (hould have been more recently added, which yet, I fuppofe, there are no 
grounds to imagine (however you would do well.
Sir, to inquire into that) it is a 
mighty confirmation of the opinion of thofe, who hold the introduction of the 
Arabian figures into England to have been about this time: for which reafon, 
though I am fenfible your draught is fufficiently accurate for every other purpofe, 
I could wifh we had a fac fimile of this date, that one might judge of it with the 
greater certainty, for fome thing, as I apprehend, may poffibly be determined from 
the form of the feveral digits.
In the mean time, if you have any inclination to 
wade into this controversy, you may fee a fhort view of it in the Magazine for 
1754, p.
157, Seq.â€ (Signed) â€œ Paul Gemsege.â€* 
To Mr. Peggeâ€™s opinion on fubjeCls of this fort, we have long been in the habit 
of paying the utmoft deference; but, in the prefent inftance, we hefitate, and have 
our doubts.
It was by no means a general thing for priories to have the privilege 
of fanCtuary: no fuch grant is made to this in queflion, by the charter of its foun- 
dation: nor is there any record to prove that it ever had fuch a privilege.
The 
extenfivenefs of its boundaries is another infuperable objection : unlefs it could be 
imagined, that it was fet up at fuch a diftance, to inform fugitives, that at the priory 
there was a fanCtuary.
Unwilling, however as we are, to fufpeCt the genuineness 
of this piece of antiquity, we are free to own, we fee no other reafon, than the 
difficulties juft alledged, to lead us to think it fpurious, Poffibly, though ancient, 
it may yet be much lefs fo, than the convent; and fet up, perhaps not long before 
the diflolution of the monafteries, when the term fancluary had come to be ufed in 
a fomewhat vague fenfe, as denoting only fanEla terra , or land appropriated ro 
religion: and therefore would then be underftood as denoting, only, that there was 
land belonging to that religious houfe.
â€” After all, as the church then belonged, in 
fome meafure, to the Nunnery, the boundaries of its fan&uary, and thofe of the 
monaftery, might be the fame.
Within thefe limits there is a fpring ftill called Chapel-Well.
Some ftones, ly- 
ing near it, which appear to have been ftones ufed in building, lead us to conjec- 
ture, that fome edifice â€” probably a little oratory, latterly called a chapel , flood there.
Few churches, or (acred buildings, were eredted, without a well near them: and 
t There is an.eftate about a mile N.
E. from Nunnery, which though each field has its particular name, 
bears the general one of Crofsfield: it is here notieed, (although no tradition or papers we have been abl6 
to meet with authorifes the fuppofition) yet its name and relative fituation, making a kind of long tri- 
angle (if the exprefiion may be ufed) between Nunnery and the crofs, gives fome additional weight to 
P. Gemfegeâ€™s opinion of there having been more crofles, or fanftuariums , formerly hereabouts, than the 
one now remaining: â€” but it ought alfo to be mentioned, that the Crofsfield eftate, although joining upon 
that of Nunnery, never appears to have been held of, or poffefTed by, that houfe} and that it lies in the 
weftern extremity of the parifh of Kirkofwald.

Hence, they were rendered fitter for luftrations, purifi-

The Family of De Aguilon (now corruptly wrote Aglionby) trace their defcent 
from Walter de Aguilon, who came into England with William the Conqueror, 
anno 1066, and into Cumberland with Randolph de Mefchines ; he gave name to the 
place of his dwelling, and called his feat, or capital mefiuage, Aguilon, or Aglionby â€™s 
building.
Kis alliance to the abbot of York, and priory of Wetheral, preferred 
him to that place* which his and their defeendants havefuccefiively hcldcn fince the 
conqueft, without any great difference, or variations in their efiates, by rifing or 
falling, lincc their firft fetrlement.
In procefs of time, they withdrew themfelves 
into Carlille, and let off the manor of Aglionby into tenements, which is now be- 
come a townfnip, and one divifion of the parifh of Warwick, which is divided 
into two quarters, Aglionby quarter and Warwick quarter.
There are no remains 
left of the ancient maniion; for after it was parcelled into tenements, the fa- 
mily continued no more there, but fixed their refidence in Carlifle, and occafionally 
at Drawdykes Cattle, in the parifh of Stanwix, till the year 1696, when John 
Aglionby, Efq. many years recorder of Carlille, exchanged Drumbugh Caflle and 
manor with Sir ^ohn Low ther, Baronet, of Lowther, for the efiate of Nunnery and 
manor of Ermathv/aite, in the parifh of Ainffable, which he had purchafed, 1690, 
of George Graham, Efq. of Nunnery, for 14361.
whofe anceftors had enjoyed it 
fince the diffoluticn of the monaftery; fince that time, Nunnery has been the 
principal refidence of the family, and continued fo till after the demife of Chrifiopher 
Aglionby, Efq. 1 7 S 5, when the family efiates were divided by a decree of the court 
of Chancery between his four furviving lifters,!

The church of Ainftablef was rectorial, as long as it remained appropriated to 
the Nunnery: it is now vicarial; the whole revenue not amounting to above 40/.
per annum.

In 1386, Adam de Aglionby was inftalled to the chauntery of the altar of St. Mary, in the collegiate 
church of Grayftock, being prefented by the noble Lord Ralph Baron of Grayftock: in 1420, Adam 
de Aglionby appears to be the then mailer of the college of Grayftock, being fued in that year by 
William Rebanks and his wife for lands in Raughton.
In 1412, Adam de Aglionby, reftor of Skelton, furrendered certain lands to Ralph Lord of Grayftock.
Sir Thcmas Aglionby, Vicar of Kirkland, died 1581.
John Aglionby, fon of Edward Aglionby and Elizabeth Mufgrave, of Crookdayke, â€œ became a ftudent 
â€œ of Queenâ€™s College in 1583, where, after he had gone through the fervile duties feveral years, he be- 
â€œ came a fellow; whereupon, entering into holy orders, he became a mod polite and learned preacher.
M Afterwards travelling, he was introduced to the acquaintance of cardinal Bellarmine, who filewing to 
â€œ him the picture of the profound William Whitaker, of Cambridge, which hung up in his library, told 
â€œ him, pointing to the picture that he mias the mojl learned Heretic that ever he read , or to that effedt.
â€œ After his return, he was made chaplain in ordinary to Queen Elizabeth; took the degree of D.

** 1600; was made principal of St. Edmundâ€™s Hall the year after, being about that time, reftor of Illip 
â€œ near to, and in the county of Oxon, and foon after chaplain in ordinary to K.

He was a

Extent, &e.] About a fquare of eight miles, whereof the largeft part is common and produces good 
pafturage for ftieep and black cattle.
Surface.] It is irregular, about Rucroft the land is high, and expofed on every quarter, about Ainftable 
and Nunnery lower and Warmer, but yet bleak and expofed.
Farms.] Small, inclofures very little and not compact; moftly occupied by their owners: little tene- 
ments & c.
feem to have arifen from the moft fertile parts of the common.
On the fouthern point lies the 
Nunnery eftate, well wooded.
Soil and Produce.] About Nunnery a ftrong loam, and produces fine wheat â€” About Rucroft, 
(which may have been fo called from the grantee, Mr. Rewe) the land ftrong.
â€” Other parts light and 
fandy, producing turnips, potatoes, barley, rye, oats and peas; and in fome trafts, wheat and clover.
Rents.] Average -bout 18s.
â€” It is to be obferved, where there is an extenfive and valuable common- 
right, the arable land lets above its intrinfic worth, in proportion to the value of commonage.
Sheep, Cattle, &c.] Sheep, of the common moor breed, about 1200.
â€” Cattle of the country breed, 
bred on the commons and fold at three and four years, old.
â€” The horfes and hufbandry gear, are in an 
improved ftate.
Agriculture.] Here an eblervation may be applied, that extends to many parishes in this county: 
That in large fat ms, agriculture is much belter attended to and of courfe the land produces more per acre , than 
in fmall tenements, in which / find little fallow, few turnips , poor crops, and the land bewildered and wild: 
the reafon of which, I prefume is, the poornefs of the occupiers of fmall farms, the weaknefs of their horfes , 
&c.
fo that providing for the prefent moment, appears to be all that fuch tenants can attain, or even aim at.* 
Roads.] From Penrith to Brampton the chief.
* This remark is worthy the public attention â€” it militates again Pc the popular prejudice touching difperfing laborious 
families and depopulating a country.
The public intereft is concerned, and humanity prompts the idea, that a man had 
better labour for certain daily wages, than be in daily hazard of ruin by adverfity of feafon, when he and his family are 
drudging in a little unproductive farm.

This parifh gave birth to Dr. John Leake , the fon of a clergyman who was curate of the fame parifh, 
and came from Glafgow, in Scotland.
He was firft fent to fchool at Croglin; and from thence removed 
to the grammar fchool at Bifhop Auckland, where he was diftinguiihedby his rapid advances to the firft 
claffes of that ancient feminary.
When his education was finifhed, he went to London, with a defign to 
engage in the proffeflion of arms: but not being endowed with fuch an ample portion of patience, (as.
was then, and which, unhappily for merit, is now more than ever requifite, if unfuppoited by parliamen- 
tary influence) as to wait the acomplifhment of thofe expectations, into which he had been flattered by 
the empty pronufes of fuperficial greatnefs, he devoted his attention to medicine.
After attending the 
hofp'tals in London, and being admitted a member of the corporation of furgeons, an opportunity pre- 
fenting itfelf of extending his knowledge, by vifiting foreign countries, he embarked for Lifbon ; whence, 
after gratifying his thirft for information by every thing worthy of remark in that metropolis, he vifited 
feveral parts of Italy, and on his return to London, commenced bufinefs, as a furgeon and manmidwife in 
the neighbourhood of Piccadilly.
He foon after publifhed â€œ A Diflertatlon on the Properties and 
â€œ Efficacy of the Lifbon Diet Drink;â€ which he adminiftred with fuccefs in many very defperate cafes 
of lues, fcrophula, and the feurvy.
Stimulated by an ardent defire to enlarge the fphere of his ufefulnefs, 
and encouraged by his fkiiful countryman, the late Dr. Hugh Sanders, who was alfo bred to the chirur- 
gical profeflion, he prefented himfelf to the prefident and cenfors of the London College, and palled the 
ufual examinations with uncommon eclat.
About this time he removed to a fpacious houfe in Craven- 
ftreet, in the Strand, where he commenced leCturer in the obftetric art, by delivering to the faculty, who 
were indiferiminately invited to attend his â€œ LeCture introductory to the Theory and Practice of Mid- 
â€œ wifery â€ which parted through four editions in 4to.
In 1765 he purchafed a piece of ground, on a 
building leafe, and afterwards prefented to the public the original plan for the inftitution of the Weftmin-

The 
fter Lying in Hofpital.
Soon as tlie building was raifed, be voluntarily and without any canfiueration, 
afiigned over to the governors all his right of the above premiles, in favour of the hofpital; and publifhed, 
in 1773, a volume of â€œ Practical Obfervations on the Child-bed Fever; and in 1774, â€œ a Lecture in- 
â€œ troduftory to the Theory and Pra&ice of Midwifery , including the Hiftory, Nature, and Tendency of 
â€œ that Science, See, publickly delivered O&ober 4th, 1773, 1774,â€ 8vo; which was afterwards confiderably 
varied, enlarged, and publifhed in 2 vcis.
under the title of â€œ Medical obfervations and Inftrudions on 
â€œ the Nature, Treatment, and cure ofvaricus Difeafes incident to Women.â€ This was fo well received 
by tire public, as to paf* through feven or eight editions ; and has been tranflated into the French and 
German languages.
About the latter end o' *791, lie war.
feizei with an ir.difpofi.ion of the breaft, which was imagined 
to have been occafioned by his application in compofing â€œ A piadical Eft ay on the Difeafes of the 
â€œ Vifcera, particularly thofe of the Stomach and Bowels.â€ He recovered from that illnefs, and in the 
fpring of 1 79a, the work was publifhed.
About three weeks before his death, lie had a return of his former 
complaint; but the day before he died, the phylician by whom he was attended as well as the doctor 
himfelf, thought he was much better ; audit was intended that he ftiouâ€™d remove the next day to deep 
in the country.
Ke retired to reft on Tuefday evening the 7th of Auguft; having given orders to his 
feivant, to cr.Il aim the next morning by eight oâ€™clock.
This it s done, and no anfwer being made, the 
man called again at nine, with as little lâ€™uccefr.
The night bolt of the chamber door was then forced, 
end Dr. Leake was found dead in his bed ; which event appeared -to have taken place feme hours.
This 
was on the 8th of Auguft, 1792.
He was fomewhat below the middle fize, temperate in diet, aftiv; in bulinefs, acute in perceptions, 
voluble and very entertaining in his difeourfe: oolite, but fomewhat precife in his manners; and, from 
a too great irritability of temper, fometirre- dilgufted both his pupils and patients, to whom he was 
nevertheless ever anxious to be ferviceablc.
Tic alfo was (what every man of tafte and reflection mud ne- 
cefTatily be) a warm admirer of Shakefpeare; and has often delighted the writer of this halty fketch 
of his life, by the feeling and pathos with which be recited many beautiful parages of that immortal 
bard.
His publications feem not to be marked by any extraordinary depth of refearch; or any new difeove- 
ries; but they are, all of them, fenfible, prafticrl, and ul'eful.
The fame character may be given of his 
ftile; which feldorn riles to a py_ remarkable degree of elevation, or elegance; but is always correct, per- 
fpicuous,and pleating.
The following paragraphs, which co.iciude his book on the Difeafes of the Vifcera, 
may perhaps be confidered as a fair fpecimen both of his fentiments and language; 
â€œ We have now endeavoured to fhew the ftate of the body and mind, and how, by their mutual 
Â«* fympathv, they co-operate with each other; what condition of the body fits it for health, or tends to 
â€œ introduce difeafes; how it is altered by the effefts of age; fubjeCl to the internal controul of inordinate 
â€œ pafiions; fervile to all the Jkycy influences, and its operations infenftbly perverted by the prevalence of 
* l cuftom, fo as to render it more variable than the weather glafs, and in a perpetual ftate of change from 
<! the cradle to the grave.
â€œ Human life, thus furrounded and afiailed by a train of unavoidable evils, may indeed be compared 
tl to a fleeting fnadow, â€¢which never conthiueth in one flay.
Like the unballafted bark in a troubled ocean, 
â€œ it becomes the fport of winds and tides; and without the aid of religion, philofophy, and reafon, is in 
â€œ continual danger of being fwallowed up and loft.
â€œ If fuch are the various alTedlions of the body and mind; and if our manner of living changes our man- 
ner of thinking, and influences our moral conduct; thrice happy they, who have been accuftomed to eaily 
â€œ temperance, and the due regulation of their pafiions, as powerful motives to virtue, and the fureft means 
â€œ of preferving health, prolonging life, and tailing its pleafures with the dignity and refinement of ra- 
tional creatures.â€

The doctor was a very perfonable man, and an accomplifiied gentleman, owing to the great advantage 
of having travelled, and alfo to his having always found an eafy admifiion into the mod fafhionable 
circles ; he was allowed to be one of the bed bred and politeft phyficians of the age.
In no part of the 
world are fuch qualities without their value ; but in London they are peculiarly proper, and even 
neceflary.
Among Dr. Leakeâ€™s few Angularities of character, may be mentioned his extraordinary, and even 
troublefome folicitude about frefii air, All his windows were made fo as to admit it at top, as well as 
at bottom ; and neither in his profeffional vifits, nor thofe of fnenddiip, could he be induced to remain 
in any room, in which fre(h air was not rnftantly and copioufly admitted.
This country is fuppofed to be greatly indebted to the late celebrated poets, Dr. Brown and Mr. Gray* 
for having firft drawn the attention of our diftant fellow-fubjedts to our mountains and lakes.
Dr. Leake 
alfo was one of the many men of tade, who was charmed with our northern feenery.
He made the tour 
of the lakes in three fucceflive fummers ; and always with frefh and increafing admiration.
His obferva- 
tions during thefe tours, were the frequent topics of his converfation; and as he had not only a large and 
genteel acquaintance, but was alfo a man of a cultivated and corredl tade ; few men contributed more 
than he did, to render a tour to the north fafhior.able.
We know not how far fuch a (light circumftance, 
as the do&orâ€™s preferring the vale of Lorton, which he has often been heard to declare, far exceeded that 
of Arno, between Pifa and Florence, to the magnificent Skiddow and Helvellyn, will juftify us in an in- 
ference, that it befpoke his character and temper, which were foft and mild in the extreme.

THE PARISH OF CROGLIN 
I S diftant from Carlifle about fourteen miles, from Penrith twelve, and Bramp- 
ton ten ; is bounded on the eaft by the parifhes of Kirkhaugh and Knarefdale* 
in the county of Northumberland, on the north by the parifhes of Caflle-Carrock 
and Cumrew, on the weft by the parifh of Cumwhitton, and on the fouth by 
Kirkofwald.
One Hastings, for his fervices to King Richard 1 .
in the crufade, at the fiege 
of Jerufalem, obtained a grant of this manor ; and fome authors have aflerted, that 
the king put his feal thereto under the walls of that city.
â€œ Crcglin, lacus ad rupem , is the name of rhe river that divides Kirkofwald 
leignory from the barony of Gilfland, at the head thereof, and after it comes to- 
wards Ainftable, it turns to Staffol, and divides them till it be received of Eden.
It is called of two Britifh words Ca?~eg, a rock, and Lyn , a water.
Of thefe words 
is corruptly framed the prefent name Crog-lin , which gives name to the town and 
church.
It was anciently the freehold of one Philip Haftings, in whofe ifliicmale 
it defcendcd till King Edward I.â€™s time, and then Croglin, and his other lands in 
Weftmorland, fell to his daughters, married to Wharton, anceftor to the 
now Lord Wharton and to Warcop ; but now the Lord Wharton holds it all to 
himfelf.
It is part of Gilfland, and holden of the lords thereof.
One of thofe 
Haftings was with the king at the fiege of Jerufalem, and received a grant of the 
king there, of lands which the king gave him in England.
The Lords Whartonâ€™s 
coat is the arms of thofe Haflings, but he hath added to them a border of Or, 
charged with lionâ€™s paws in faltier abouc the Haflingsâ€™ coat, which is a manche* 
at gent in a field Jable.â€% 
The late Duke of Whartonâ€™sf truflees fold the manor of Croglin to the Duke of 
Somerfet, from whom it defcended to rhe Earl of Egremont, the prefent owner.* 
There is a fmall manor called Newby, belonging to the Earl of Carlifle.
The church is redorial, dedicated to St. John Baptifl, and always was in the 
patronage of the lord of the manor of Croglin, till the late Duke of Wharton fold 
the fame in grofs to Matthew^ Smales, Efq. from whom it came to the late Rev.

It lies in a vale which 
is beautiful : â€” as it extends fouthward, it widens confiderably, and confifls of rich 
lands.
The inclofures flretch up the hills, both to the eaft and weft.
The village 
is irregularly fcattered on the declivities of the eminence, and in the depth of the 
vale ftands the manfiomhoufe of Timothy Feaiherftonhaugh, Efq. detached from 
the village ; a genteel houfe, but not placed in an eligible lituation.
The brook 
runs very near it,and a mill projeding into the town ftreet, forms no very agreeable 
cbjed.
â€” The ground towards the eaft, in front, is broken and very fteep, but to- 
wards the weft, the lands open, and form a beautiful level on the banks of the 
Eden.
This manfion w as probably built by fome of the Dacre family, is ereded 
on the fite of the collegiate houfe, the proprietor having the glebe lands, and part 
of the tithes, which he derives from the grantee of the crown.
The caftle ftands 
at the diftance of five or fix' hundred yards to the eaft of the town, on an elevated 
fituation, furrounded with fine lands, the declivities cloathed with wood.

f 
Authors difagree much as to the ancient owners of this manor.
â€œ Kirkofwald 
eccle/ia SanSIo Ofvsaldo facra, is the name of the town and parifh there, and of 
very ancient time it hath been l'o termed.
The caRle Was built by the Engaines, 
1 ords of Burgh, Ilhall, Herreby, and Kirkofwald.
It was firft founded by Radulph 
Engaine; but far lhort of that beauty and Rate which it had afterwards by his 
fucceflbrs.
Sir Hugh Morvill, in King Johnâ€™s time, inclofed the park, in the fe- 
cund year of that reign, by the kingâ€™s licence ; and Radulphus de Levington, that 
married Ada, daughter of Jotrice Morvill, daughter and coheir of Hugh Morvill, 
added thereunto a part of Gamellby and GlaRonby.
Thomas, fon of Thomas 
de Multon, and John de CaRre, that married the widow of Thomas Multon, of 
Gilfland, in King Edward II.
â€™s time, made additions to the caRle: but the Lord 
Thomas Dacre, that married the heir of GravRock, did finilh it and mote it about 
w ith great charge, which notwithstanding, in the third defeent after him, is now in 
a manner become altogether ruinous.
It was RrR parcel of the feignory of Adam, 
fon of Svvene, fon of Ailrich, and granted forth with a daughter to Trivers Lord 
of Burgh, chief foreRer of the fee of Englewood ForeR, by whofe daughter Ibria 
wife to Radulph Engaine, it came to him.
This lordfnip did contain Kiikofwald, 
NcwRaffol, Ravenwick, Harflceugn, Huddlefkeugh, Little Croglin, and Kabeigh, 
alias Lanbergh, and all the land and waRe towards the eaR mountains, from the 
river Eden on the well, and between Croglin water on the north, and the little 
Rilldale Raghon beck on the foutâ€™n, that divides it from GlaRonby and Gamellby.
The heirs of Adam, fon of Swene, were Yorkfhiremen, therefore not regarded 
here, as the owners of Kirkofwald.
And after the making of ynagna charta, and 
the rebellion of Roger Montbegon, meanlord, they held it of the king immedi- 
ately.â€* 
ft Part of the demefnes of Kirkofwald are now (1749) the inheritance of the 
FcatherRons, who are a branch of the FeatherRons of FeatherRonhaugh, in the 
county of Northumberland, and generally write their names FeatherRonhaugh, or 
halgh, the RrR of them I meet with was Henry, who married a daughter of the 
Vfyberghs of Clifton.
Timothy, afterwards knighted, their fon, who was a great 
royalifl during the civil wars; and being taken prifoner at CheRer fight, was ex- 
ecuted for fighting againfi the parliament.
He married a daughter of the 
Patrickfons, of Calder-Abbey, and had iflue Thomas, who married a daughter of 
the Dacres, of LanercoR, and had iflue Timothy, who married a daughter of the 
Billinghams, of Leving, and had iflue Heneage, who married one Lidflon, a De- 
vonfhire lady, and had iflue Timothy, now in pofleflion.
The arms of this family 
are gules, three oflrich feathers, argent , or gules a chevron ermine between three 
oflrich feathers argent.

It is well afcertained, that Trivers married a daughter of Ralph de Mefchines : 
according to Dugdale, Kirkofvvald came to Sir H igh Morvill, by marriage of 
Heloife de Stutteville; from Sir Hugh it defeended to the Multons, and from 
them to the Dacres.
Thomas Lord Dacreâ€™s daughter and heirefs, Joan, married 
Sir Richard Fines, and by the marriage of their daughter, it palled to Sampfon 
Leonard, and fo to Thomas Lennard, who married Anne Fitz Roy, one of the 
daughters of King Charles II.
by the Duchefs of Cleveland, and was created Earl 
of Suftex, whofe daughters and coheireftes fold this manor to Sir Chriftopher Muf- 
grave, Bart, father of Sir Philip Mufgrave, of Edenhall, Bart, the prefent owner.
The caftle, by the following defeription of it, faid to be given by Mr. Sand- 
ford, mult once have been a noble edifice.
â€œ On the river Eden ftandeth the ca- 
u pital grand caflle of Kirkofwald, and a very fine church there, and quondam 
â€œ college ; now the noble manfion houfe of the late Sir Timothy Fcatherftonhaugh, 
*' colonel of the kingâ€™s fide, taken at Wigan, where the late lord Witherington was 
Â« f flain.
Sir Timothy was taken prifoner, and executed by beheading at Chefier, 
by the command of the unworthy Colonel Mitton, after the faid knight had 
** quarter given him.
This great caftle of Kirkofwald, was once the faireft fabric 
* f that ever eyes looked upon.
The hall, I have feen, one hundred yards long, 
â€œ and the great portraiture of King Brute, lying in the end of the roof of this hall, 
â€œ and of all his fucceflors, kings of England, portraited to the waift, their vifage, 
,c hats, feathers, garbs, and habits, in the roof of this hall ; now tranflated to 
â€œ Naward Caftle, where they are placed in the roof of the hall, and at the head 
* r thereof.
This caftle was the ancient place of the Lord Multon marrying the Lord 
â€œ Vauxâ€™s heir.
Lord of Naward and Gilfland ; and afterwards of the late Lords 
â€œ Dacre ; and now come by lineal defeent to the noble Earl of Suflex; with the 
" lands adjoining, and many brave parks and villages belonging thereto.â€ Sir 
Hugh Morvill made it the chief place of his refidence, and inclofed the park ; 
Camden fays, â€œ who was that Hugh Morvill, who, with his accomplices, murder- 
" ed the Archbifhop of Canterbury, in memory of which faift the fword he then 
*' ufed, was preferved here for a long time.â€Â§ This faÂ£t was committed in the 
feventeenth year of the reign of King Henry II.
from a fervile and bafe principle 
of gratifying the wifhes of a prince, who could not brook the feveriry of religious 
remonftrance.
After the crime was perpetrated, the aftaftins entered into the 
archbifhopâ€™s (tables, and feizing his horfes, pofted to Knarfborough, in Yorkfhire, 
where Sir Hugh had a ftrong caftle; they are faid to have refided at that place, 
committing (uch excefles and (hewing fuch diffolure manners, that the country 
detefted them, and even the vafials fhewed ligns of revolt ; and that the 
enormities of thefe aflbeiates were infupportable, Mr, Denton afierts, that the 
(word, which Sir Hugh ftained with this deteftable murder, was in his fatherâ€™s 
time, at Hell ; which place belonged to the Morvills, as heirs of Engayne; and af- 
ter that, it remained in the houfe of Arundell.
In the fecond year of King Johnâ€™s 
reign.
Sir Hugh obtained licence to inclofe his woods here, to fortify his manor 
houfe, and to have a weekly market at his town of Kirkoiw'ald on the Thurfday,

Thomas, the foil of Thomas de Mukon, and John dc Cadre, 
who efpoufed his widow, made great improvements to this cattle, enlarged the 
apartments, and fortified the whole with an outward wall.
After them Thomas 
de Dacrc added a ftrong fotte to the out-works ; and, at a vaft expence, beautified 
the cattle within.
The family of Fcatherftonhaughs, now fettled here, were defcended from the 
family of Feathertton Cattle, in Northumberland, of which houfe a fmall oval 
engraving is given in the firtt volume of the View of Northumberland.
The fol- 
lowing ft range tale is related from Machel, that â€œ their houfe (in Northumberland) 
â€œ was formerly upon a hill, where there are two (tones called Featherftones.
and 
<f was moated about for a defence againft the Scots ; but.
upon the ruin of this, the 
" houfe was afterwards built in the holme or valley under the hill, which they 
<f there call Haugh, and thence it w'as called Featherftonhaugh.â€f The family held 
Feathertton Cattle as member of the barony of Tynedale, in the reign of King

Euphonize Gratia , and lignifics a fct 
of flails or flables, inclofed, as is ufual in the north, within a fold, for the fake of 
fecurity, an inferior manor, dependent on Kirkofvvald.
It gave name to a family 
whofe male line was extind in the reign of King Henry V.
The inheritance fell 
to daughters, who did transfer it by their marriages to the Chambers.
Mulcaflers, 
and BlenerhafTets, of Carliell.
It is now the property of Sir Frederick Vane, Bart, 
of Hutton-Hall, and Sir Philip Mufgrave, Bart, is Lord Paramount.
Â§ Harefceugh, 
or Harefcow, fo called perhaps from Hare , and the Anglo-Saxon word jkohs , a 
fhoe, a name fometimes given by country people to a fpccies of trefoil, that grows 
wild : or it may ha/e gotten its name from Jkeugb , which Nicolfon and Burn, in 
their Gloffary, fay (though we know not in what language, befides our own pro- 
vincial one) denotes a floazv , another inferior manor.
It was part of the poffeftions 
of the priory of Lanercofl, given thereto by Ada de Engaine, and confirmed by 
Sir Hugh Morvill.
After the diffolution, the Dacres fold it to Dr. Peter Barvvick, 
Phyfician in Ordinary to King Charles II.
who gave it to the chapel and poor of 
Witherflack, in Weflmorland.
Little Croglin, another inferior manor.f <c Croglin parva Hands in the fame 
parifli and townfhip, and is a fee of Kirkofvvald.
It was anciently the Beauchampâ€™s 
until King Henry VII.
â€™s time, and then the Dacres, Lords Paramount, purchased 
it to their feignory.
Anciently, toward the time of King Henry I.
one Ughtrcd 
held a part thereof, and dame Obriade Trivers another; and afterwards one Elias 
de Crogline, William his fon, and William, fon of William, his nephew, who gave 
fome part of the fame to the houfe of Wederhall, which Roger Beauchamp con- 
firmed, that is, the fifth part of the town, now (as I think) called Cringle Dyke.â€* 
As a part of the pofleflions of that religious houfe, after the diffolution it came to 
the dean and chapter of Carlifle, who leafe it out.
The manor was purchafed 
in the reign of King Henry VII.
by Dacre, then Lord of the feignory of 
Kirkofvvald.
|| 
The church of Kirkofvvald is dedicated to St. Ofwald : about the year 1523, ir 
was made collegiate for twelve fecular priefls.^ The building is irregular and 
difproportioned.
Whilft the Dacres were lords, they either rebuilt this fabric, or 
made feveral additions to beautify it, as appears by the arms of Dacres and Cliffords 
in the wdndows.
The quire, moft probably was enlarged, on the foundation of 
the college.
Bifhop Nicholfon fuppofes, that the fpring which iffues from under 
the well end of the church, was a great motive for the founders chufing that fitu- 
ation, from the veneration which was paid to wells by the Saxons.

PARISH OF KIRKOSWALD.
21 1 
In the year 1305, Bifhop Halton held a great ordination here, viz.
7 acolites, 
25 fubdeans, 26 deacons, and 21 priefts ; of whom feveral were monks of the 
abbeys of Holme, Furnefs, and other great houfes.
In the year 1668, it was efleemed not worth the expence of a prefentation under 
the great feal, and a curate was licenfed thereto.
The tithes of Staffold and Blunderfield, being all thofe arifing within the parifh, 
except what are the property of Mr. Fcatherftonhaugh, belong to MclTrs. Thomas 
Gibfon and Thomas Bowman, as impropriators.
On the fide of a hill, on the left 
hand of the road leading to Penrith, about a mile from Kirkofwald, are two cairns 
of a middle fize.
THE PARISH OF RENWICK, 
W HICH may have been fo called, as Mr. Denton fuppofes, from the violence 
and rapidity of the ftream ; whence alfo our modern words rave and ravenous % 
and ravin: or, it may have been a Danifh fettlement, diftinguifhed by the flandard 
of the raven : or, finally, it may, in fome very difiant period, have been the place 
of refort of ravens, which are generally found only in wildernefles, and where there 
are few or no inhabitants; or, poffibly, the firfi: fettlers there, or fome leading fa- 
Rivers.] Eden bounds W.
Croglin water N.
and Raven S.
â€” over eacb a ftone bridge â€” falmon in 
Eden, trout and eels in that and the lefler rivers.
A brook runs through Kirkofwald which turns a com 
and paper mill.
Quarrifs.] Several of freeftone, on Harefceugh fell, a porphry or marble of a blue colour; fomc 
fpotted with white.
School.] One at Kirkofwald of good repute â€” the late Mr. Lowthian endowed it with a yearly in- 
come of 81 .
or 81 .
1 os.
Poor.] The rate colle&ed by the ancient purvey, about 140I.
a-year â€” there is a poor flock of 50I.
yearly, divided at Chriftmas, and Mr. Lowthian left a fund for diflributing twelve pennyworth of bread 
at the church every Sunday.
Tithes.] Sir Philip Mufgraveâ€™s e [fates, tithe-free â€” other eftates pay in kind.
Church.] The armsof Dacre in feveral places â€” an elegant monumentof SirTimothyFeatherflonhaugh.
Wood.] Plantations of oak and firs, near the rivers â€” and ftrong hedge-rows.
Proprietors.] Sir Philip Mufgrave â€” Timothy Featherflonhaugh, Efq. and Mifs Aglionby.
State of Population.] Kirkofwald divifion, 654 inhabitants, of whom there are 8 taylors, 3 weavers, 
16 common labourers, 1 cooper, 3 mafons, 5 fhoemakers, 1 officer of excife, 2 Joiners, 1 furgeon, 5 
blackfmiths, 1 butcher, 2 innkeepers, 4 carpenters, 3 papermakers, 1 ropemaker, r grocer, 3 millers, 
l dyer, 1 fuller, 10 miners, 1 fchoolmafter, 1 gatdener, and the families are all of the church of England 
except 1 Prefbyterian and 1 Quaker.
Staffold divifion, 283 inhabitants â€” total of the population 937 â€” of the inhabitants of this divifion are 
I millwright, 2 fhoemakers, 6 common labourers, 1 blackfmith, 1 gardener, 1 mafon, and one weaver, 
and the families are all of the church of England except 6 Prefbyterians.
This parifh is remarkable for the longevity of the inhabitants, fome being ninecy years of age.
Since 
1685, there has been little variation in the number of inhabitants, till within ten years lafl paft, in which 
period they have increafed confiderably.
Here is no manufactory, but of paper, except forhoufehold ufe.

j- Extent and Aspect.] Chiefly faces to the weft â€” from N.
to S.
2 miles, E.
to W.
4 miles.
Soil ] A red light fand ; cold and unfruitful, from its vicinity to the mountains, ar.d rifing off a foft 
freeftone ; produces oats, a fmall quantity of barley, and fome potatoes.
There is no attempt to grow 
wheat, owing to the (beep being brought down in winter.
The tillage in dales, or ridges.
Some at- 
tempts to exchange and inclofe.
Sheep and Cattle.] About 2000 ftieep.
No attention paid to the breed, they are bred off the 
fame old ftock, and are lefs and lighter than thofc of Croglin.
â€” The common affords good pafturage, but 
the flocks are often overblown with fnow, with great lofs â€” about eight or nine fleeces to the done.
Some 
Scotch mares kept on the common for breeding, and fome few' black cattle.
Roads.] From Brampton to Aldfton, Appleby, &c.
Fuel.] Coal got in the parifti, of a mean quality, peats and turf.
Game.] .Groufe, hares, partridges, & c.
Rivers.] Raven divides this from Kirkofwald parifh.
Has abundance of tiouts.
Mountains and Minerals.] A (hare of the eaftern mountains ; Thackmoore fell, where coal-works 
are ; lime burnt there, of the fined and whiteft quality.
Aip. and Climate.] Subjedf to fogs, particularly in autumn.
Very cold in winter.
School.] An endowment of 10s.
but no fchool.
Wood.] A ftrip of oak wood about two acres on the riverâ€™s banks.
Tithes.] All the proprietors pay a prefeription in lieu of tithes, except the owner of one eftate, * 
who has a total exemption, derived from a circumftance which happened about 200 years ago, almoft too 
ridiculous to be rehearfed or credited.
The ancient poffeffor is faid to have (lain a noxious cockatrice, 
which the vulgar call a crack-a-chrijl at this day, as they rehearfe the fimple fable.
There is fome record, f 
which the owner of the eftate holds to teftify his exemption, perhaps in a language or letter not to be 
linderftood by the villagers ; and which he is too tenacious to fuffer to be read by curious vifitors.

There is a colliery on the common, which produces a yearly rent of about thirty-

The church of Renwick is dedicated to All Saints, was rectorial; but having 
been appropriated to the priory of Hexham, in Northumberland, or, as fome 
authors fay, to St. Maryâ€™s, in York, after the diffolution of religious houfes, in the

The church, in 1733, was rebuilt by the parilhioners.
THE PARISH OF ALDSTON, OR ALSTON, 
I S mentioned in the Hiftory of Northumberland; but as this county hiftory 
might fcem imperfect, without fome account of fo remarkable a place, 
we make no apology for tranfcribing fome part of what was there faid on that 
fubjedi : â€” â€œ It is a fmall market town, meanly built, fituated on the declivity of a 
â€œ lieep-hill, inhabited by miners.
The fatigue of palling bad roads, in a moun- 
*Â« tainous, barren, and inhofpitable country, was in no wile alleviated by the fcene, 
â€œ which prefented itfelf here.
Pent in a narrow valley, over which mountains 
â€œ frowned with a melancholy Herility and nakednefs ; the wind tempelfuous, im- 
â€œ pending clouds Hretching forth a dark and difconfolate curtain over the face of 
â€œ morning, rain beating vehemently againft the windows, which were not able to 
â€œ refill the Form ; a few' trees Handing near the inn, tolled by the heavy blaFs

We might be bold to challenge Derbyfhire, 
or even Cornwall, to produce fo peculiarly wild a fpot as Aldfton Moor ; where all 
that the earth produces is from its bowels, and where the people alfo are fo gene- 
rally fubterraneous.
In no place is there a greater fcope for contemplating pecu-

That part of Tynehead, which belongs to Mr. Carleton, is freehold, and he hath all the royalties.â€” 
The reft is held by leafe.
Antiquities.] The Roman road, called Maiden-way, leads through this parilh, its remains very dif- 
tinft in feveral places.
A little below Tyne bridge, on an eminence called Hall hill, fome ancient fortr;fs 
ftood moated round ; the Tyne, in walhing away the banks, difeovers fome pieces of filver, but none arc

Caverns.] A large cavern in Gilderfdale fell, called Tutman-hole ; feveral perfons have ventured to 
explore this place for a mile in length.
At a place called Dunfell (which is in the limits of Weftmotland) 
fome miners were at work, not long fince, purfuing a vein of ore, when they opened into a fpacious ca- 
vern.
Some people, who have viewed this place, have found it expedieut to adopt the contrivance of 
Dedalus in the labyrinth, and take a clue of thread with them, to guide them fafely in their return, the 
chambers and paflages are fo intricate.
The Rev. William Richardfon was feven horns in examining this 
curious place ; he deferibes the roof in fome parts to refemble Gothic arches, in others a flat furface, â€” 
that the windings are intricate, â€” that he found in places the Jlalaflities , and pieces of Rhombo 'tdal fpar .
â€” 
He travelled near two miles in a right line, and difeovered evident marks of fome of the chambers having 
been filled with water, by the coating of mud on the fides.
The greateft height of the vault above 25 yards, 
and the breadth in fome places about 150 yards.
In other paflages he could fcarcely crawl.
Other 
vifitors have fpoken of the aftonilhing luftre of the fpar with which thefe vaults are encrufted, ftruck by 
the light of the candles and flambeaux which they carried.
Fuel.] The coal burnt in Aldfton town, is the Craw coal, and has a ftrong fulphureous exhalation, 
which is thought unwholefome â€” the cottages burn peat.
Game.] Groufe, but hardly any other.
Poor.] Land of 40I.
a-year belongs to the poor ftock, but the maintenance of the poor cofts nearly 
500I.
more.
Tenure of Lands.] 22 freeholders, the reft of the lands leafehold.
School.] One endowed with iol.
a-year iffuing out of lands â€” feveral inferior fchools without endow- 
ments.
Rivers and Fish.] Rivers Tyne, Nent, and Blackburn â€” they all rife in the mountains â€” No other 
fifh than fmall trout.
â€” Over Tyne a ftone bridge, of one arch, over Nent two bridges of ftone, and one 
of wood.
Buildings.] Moftly of ftone, covered with lime, and dated.
Remarkable Water,] On Gilderfdale fell is a bog, or dead water, the top of which is covered fome 
inches thick with a fort of mud, which the neighbouring people ufe for painting yellow and red ; it pro- 
duces colours like yellow ochre and Spanilh brown : â€” no fcientific perfon has hitherto had the curiofity 
or opportunity, duly to inveftigate and analyfe this uncommon produ&ion.
Roads,] To Durham, Hexham, and Haltwhiftle â€” rough and broken.
Berries;] The newt berry, a cluftered bramble -like crane berry â€” noted in the fequel under the title 
Natural Hijlory ; being the rubus cham&morus.

The country is mountainous, barren and gloomy; the mines compenfate to the 
proprietor for the want of outward beauty and a more productive foil ; whilft the 
common inhabitant fuffers all the inconveniences of a dreary and defolate country 
and an inclement climate.* 
By an inquifition in the eight year of King Edward II.

Nicholas de Vipont, it appears that he held the capital melfuage, 14 acres of arable 
land.
Extent.] Eight miles and a half N.

General Appearance.] The buildings are white, and fome of them have a few trees near themâ€” 
the inclofures fenced with walls â€” Where the lands lie to the rivers, they look pleafant, but the wafles 
are dreary.
The parilh is furrounded with mountains of great height and extent, chiefly covered with 
heath and bent, affording a fcanty pafturage.
Sheep.] About.

fecond year.
Aged wedders fell from ios.
to 14s.
a-piece â€” 6 fleeces to the Hone, at 7s.
Manners of the Inhabitants.] Moft of the men are miners, and by long continuance in the 
works they fliew a fimplicity of manners, rarely found among other labouring people ; they are ftron <r of 
limb, and when in liquor, a vice too frequent, they are quarrelfome, refolute and ferocious ; but when 
from home, are remarkably traftable, and fteadfaftly attached to their countrymen and fellow-labourers.
Mining renders the people, later in manhood, unhealthy, and the ftrongeft feldom exceed 60 years of age.

The church is dedicated to St. Auftin, is in the deanery of Corbridge, and

|| The inhabitants formerly built huts on the commons, to which they reforted in the fummer feafon, 
with their herds and flocks, for the convenience of paflurage, where the commons were very extenlive, 
and lay at a didance from their ufual habitations.
The Scotch Hill follow the praftice.
â€” Thefe huts 
they called fhields or fhieldings.
j Francis, Earl of Derwentwater, Vifcount Ratcliffe and Langley, and Baron of Tyndale, by his in- 
denture, dated May 6th, 1689, demifed to John Vazie, of Lowbyer, in AldHon Moor, gent, all his lead- 
mines and minerals, and all other mines and minerals, ores, earth, metals, and Hones, (coals excepted) at 
Battle Green, near Guttergyll, in AldHon Moor, for 21 years, paying a fifth part of the ore, as duty 
ore.
See a fai 7 Jimile of the earlâ€™s writing fubferibed to this leafe, taken from the original in the collec- 
tion of Edward ConHable, Efq. of Burton Conflable, Yorkfhire.
It is a tribute due to his moH gracious 
majeHy King George III.
and to his councils, that we mention in this place, that aft of beneficence 
which reHored the fqrplus revenues of the Ratcliffe eHates to the prefent reprefentative of that houfe, 
and the immediate fucceffor of the unfortunate earl â€” Let the diffatisfied and clamorous at this time re- 
collcft how many afts of munificence have maiked this reign, among which the difpofitions to the 
American loyalilfs are not the lealt.
* The lands are let upon leafes for 99.9 years, which demifes were granted between the year 161 1, and 
1616, by Henry Hilton ; the tenants pay a twenty.

[Leath Ward.
The village of Melmerby confifts of 47 houfes, including the manfion-houfe of 
the lord of the manor ; is fituated about half a mile from the bafe of the moun- 
tains.
Cultivation and Soil.] The townfield contains near 300 acres, fome of which has lately been in- 
clofed â€” where it is open, the land lies in doles or ridges.
â€” The owners chiefly cultivate their own land* 
â€” The foil is of a dry, (andy nature, lying on a ied freeftone rock ; produces good oats, barley, and po- 
tatoes : â€” turnips and wheat do not fuit : and rye is fubjedt to be broken down by the helm-wind.
The 
farmers depend chiefly on the grafs lands â€” 14s.
and 15s.
per acre the average rent, except for townfield 
land, which is about 10s.
per acre.
Tenure.] There are 17 freeholders, the reft of the lands are cuftomary, under arbitrary fines.
â€” The 
chief part of the cuftomary land is held under Thomas Pattenfon, Efq. â€” Henry Holme, of Gale, has 6 or 
7 cuftomary tenants who pay a twenty -penny fine certain.
â€” Gale formerly belonged to the Huttons, of

In one part, above a fpacious valley, rifes abruptly the bold front of a lime- 
ftone rock, called Melmerby fear, which report fays, was once fo intermixed with lead ore, that the rays 
of the fetting fun falling upon it, caufed it to be feen at a great diftance.
The (heep and cattle grazing 
on the mountains have a beautiful paftoral appearance.
The mines of lead and copper have not been 
wrought with fuccefs of late years.

afeends out of Ouffiy dale, to the top of Melmerby fell, and then (lopes along the fide for 3 or 4 miles.
The Rev. Mr.
Slee, who gave us great information touching this parifli, meafured it in different places,, 
and found it uniformly about 21 feet in width.
r i he road is laid with large ftones, fo as to be difficult 
for horfes to pafs it.
Fuel ] Chiefly coal â€” fome frnall quantities of peat and turf.

We acknowledge great obligations to the Rev. John Slee, for much valuable information.
We have 
taken the liberty to digeft many of his remarks with Hous manâ€™s Notes.
Biography W ether al.
â€œ 'John Salkeld, fourth fon of Edward Salkeld, gent fecond brother to George Salkeld, fome time of 
â€œ Corby Caftle, in Cumberland, Efq. lineally defeended from Sir Richard Salkeld, Kt. Lord Warden of 
â€œ Carlifle in the time cf King Richard III was born at Corby Castle ; and when very young, journeyed 
â€œ through Oxon to beyond the feas: but in vvhathoufehe was entered, unlefs in Queenâ€™s College, I cannot 
â€œ tell.
His continuance there, as I have been informed, was fo ftiort (occafioned by his religion) that wc 
â€œ can fcarce reckon him among the Oxonians.
For, fo it was, that his father foon after conveyed him 
â€œ into Spain ; entered him among the jefuits in the univerfity of Coimbra, where, as alfo atCorduba and 
â€œ Complutum, he continued among them in the condition of a jefuit many years, and was affiftant in the 
â€œ ftudies of the famous jefuit Francis Suarius (who was his fellow-ftudent feveral years) and Michael 
â€œ Vafquez.
Afterwards he was fent into Portugal, where he read philofophy about fix years ; then into 
â€œ the Englifh million ; but being taken and brought before King James I.
who had feveral times heard 
â€œ of him and his eminency for learning, he entered into divers difputes with him at feveral times.
At 
â€œ length, being overcome by his folid arguments, Salkeld turned Proteftant ; was recommended to Dr.
â€œ King, Bilhop of London, for maintenance ; and in Nov. 1613, became, by the prefentation of his 
â€œ majelly.
Vicar of Willington, in Somerfetlhire, (being then B.
D.) where he ufed to boall of his con- 
â€œ verfion, and to ftile himfelf The Royal Convert.
In 1635, he was made minifter of Church-Taunton, in 
â€œ Devonlhire, worth to him about 200I.
per annum, whereupon one Walter Travers was inllituted Vicar 
â€œ of Willington.
in his place, on the 16th of July, in the fame year.
But after the civil wars broke 
â€œ fo th, he luffered for the royal caufe; being efteemed, by the obftinate and credulous Prelbyterians, 
â€œ a Papift in his heart, or at leaft papilhly affected.
He was a perfon profoundly read in Theological 
â€œ and other authors; and King James I.
doth ftile him, in his works, â€œ The learned Salkeld of which 
â€œ charadter he would often glory.
His works are, 
1. â€œ A Treatife of Angels, See. London, 1613, 8vo.
dedicated to King James I 
2. â€œ A Treatife of Paradife and the principal contents thereof ; dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon, 
â€œ Keeper of the Great Seal.
He gave way to fate at Ulfculme, in Devonlhire, (having for fourteen years 
â€œ before been fequeftered of Church-Taunton) in Feb. 1659, aged 84 ; and buried in the church there 
â€œ by his fon John Salkeld, of Ulfculme, gent.
He left behind him feveral things of his compofition, fit 
â€œ for the prefs ?

In this parilh, in 1676, Caleb Threlkeld, the author of â€œ A Treatife on the Native Plants of Ireland,â€ 
was born.
In 1698, he commenced A.
M. in the univerfity of Glafgow ; and foon after fettled at Low 
Huddlefceugh, near the place of his birth, as a dilfenting minifter.
During his refidence at Glafgow, he 
had acquired a tafte for botany and phyfic ; and continued to make a confiderable progrefs in thefe 
ftudies; infomuch that, in 1712, he took a doctorâ€™s degree in phyfic at Edinburgh; and the next year, 
having but a fmall income and a large family, he removed to Dublin, and fettled there in the united

His pradlice as a 
phyfician foon increafed, fo far as to enable him to drop his other character entirely, and devote himfelf 
wholly to phyfic.
Soon after his publiihing the Synopfs Â£> fir pi am Hibernioarum , he was taken with a 
violent fever, and died at his houfe in Markâ€™s Alley, Frances-ftreet.
He was buried in the new burial 
ground belonging to St. Patrickâ€™s, near Cavan-ftreet ; to which place his obfequies were attended by a 
fet of children, educated by a fociety of gentlemen, to which inftitution he had adled as phyfician.
He 
was much regretted by the poor, to whom he had been, both as a man and a phyfician, a kind benefadtor.
He meditated a general hillory of plants ; but it does not appear, that he ever publifhed any thing, but 
the above-mentioned Synopfis, in Dublin, 1727, 8vo.

After a dedication to the Archbifhop of Armagh, ar.d preface, which, (though written in a quaint flile 
proves him to have been a man of fome erudition in the fcience, he enumerates all the plants he had obferved 
in the environs of Dublin, and all fuch as he had gained authentic intelligence of, from other parts of the 
kingdom.
He gives firft the old Latin names, generally from Cafper Bauchineâ€™s Pinax ; then the Englilh 
name; and afterwards the Irifh : fubjoining fome account of the quality of the plant, and its ufe in 
medicine, and ceconomy.
Some curious obfervations moreover are interfperl'ed in his work: as for infiance, 
under the betula, or birch-tree, he fays, â€” â€œ The Irifh Grammarians remark, that all the names of the 
â€œ Irifh letters are names of trees.â€ Under IraJJica , he obferves, that the word is only the Celtic 
â€œ praiffeagh put into a Latin termination ; the Latin itfelf being no other than the Celtic language cloalh- 
â€œ ed with the JEolic dialedi, as Englilh is the Saxon, Teutonic, or Dutch language, cloathed with Nor- 
â€œ mandy French, as all antiquarians will allow.â€ 
It is obfervable, that Threlkeld notices the good effedls of the hy thrum Salicaria , or purplo-fpiked wil- 
low herb, or loofe-ftr'fe, in a dyfcntery : a fimple of an aftringent quality, which cattle are fond of, though 
Lightfoot fays, â€œ it is rarely ufed in medicine.â€ Yet, fince Threlkeldâ€™s time, Dr. Havtn has ftrongly 
recommended it in dyfenteries, and obftinate diarrheas.
(See Rationis Medendi, vol.
I. p.
226, 357.) 
He alfo fpeaks in high terms, and from his own experience, of the powers ufually attributed to the 
vienyanthes trifoliata, march trefoil, bog-bean, or (as it is generally pronounced in Cumberland, where the 
plant is common) buck-bean.
The very fenfible John IVilfon, of Kendal, (the Linneus of the north, 
though of the old fchool) fpeaks of it as a great antifcorbutic ; very ferviceable for the gout, rheuma- 
tifm, and dropfy ; and much ufed in diet-drinks for thofe diftempers.
It is likewife a good ftomachic, 
made ufe of in intermitting fevers : and not unfrequently drank as tea, being, probably, as pleafant and 
as wholefome as other indigenous teas.
Lightfoot fays, the flowers of this plant are fo extremely beau- 
tiful, that nothing but its native foil could exclude it from a place in every garden.
They grow in an 
elegant fpike ; are white, dallied with pink, and fringed internally with hairs.
Threlkeld quotes from 
Dr. Vaughan, a cafe of the fatal effedt of the mackenbay, or niackingboy, or euphorbia Hyberna.
Dr.
Molyneux has obferved, that the genijla fpinofa, or ulex foliis villofis acutis, fpinis fparfis, whins, furze, or 
gorfe, although common in other parts of Ireland, is not feen in the province of Connaught.
If this ob- 
fervation be well-founded, it is a very extraordinary fadl.
Tn the Appendix, printed from the papers of Dr. Molyneux, the reader will meet with many fuch 
obfervations, equally curious.
Among others, an inftance of the effedls of the roots of the hypofcyamus 
vulgaris, or common hen-bane, upon feveral per fons, who having eaten them inftead of flcirrets, were 
affedled with vertiginous fymptoms ; and in one cafe, a phrenzy enfued, which held the perfon two or 
three days.
It is indeed well known, that the root, leaves, and feeds of this plant are a moft powerful 
narcotic ; they have been known to deprive men, fora while, of the ufe of their limbs, as well as reafon ; 
and yet, under the diredlion of fkilful phyficians, it is a moil valuable medicine ; and, we believe, has 
lately come much into ufe.

Housmanâ€™s Notes.
There is the recumbent effigy of a man in armour, carved of oak, in this church, but of the perfonage 
whofe tomb it was an ornament, we have no tradition.
The Editors.
It is much to be regretted, that, in lefs than a fingle century, it has been found impoffible, after a very 
diligent enquiry, to collect any confiderable information of a former reftor of this parifh ; who, in his day, 
was an ufeful and valuable man; and whofe works ftill refleft no ordinary credit on our county.
The per- 
fon here alluded to, is the Rev.
"Thomas Robinfon ; who was the author not only of â€œ The Natural Hif- 
tory of Weftmorland and Cumberland,â€ (fo flightly mentioned by our late county hiftorians) but alfo of 
â€œ A Natural Hiftory of this World of Matter and this World of Life;â€ and â€œ The Anatomy of the 
Earth.â€ All thefe are uncommonly learned works, now become fcarce; and it deferves to be noticed, 
how nearly many of his conjeftures, on fundry deep and difficult fubjeCls, fuggefted almoft in the infancy 
of experimental natural philofophy, coincide with the belt received opinions of modern philofophers â€” 
Like the celebrated Hutchinfon, (who was alfo a northern man) and the prefent Mr. Williams, author 
of an excellent â€œ Natural Hiftory of the Mineral Kingdom,â€ Mr. Robinfon appeared to have been much 
concerned in what he calls â€œ The Infpeclion of Under-ground Projedls, of feveral Kinds and Nature.â€ 
The place of his habitaiion, (under Crofs-fell, one of the higheft mountains in England) where he fays 
he had paffed thirty pears in the ftudy of â€œ fubterranean philofophy,â€ was peculiarly favourable to fuch 
enquiries: and his abilities feem to have procured him many refpedtable friends and patrons: though it 
does not appear that he ever obtained any other preferment, than this fmall redlory.
We have not been able to learn where he was born ; nor, as all his cotemporaries are now dead, have 
we been able to trace the fates and fortunes of eight children, who, as appears from the regifter, were bom 
to him, and baptifed at Oufby.
The late Mr. Thomas Robinfon, of Crookdake, in the parilh of Brom- 
field, who was a man of diftinguifhed abilities and liberal manners, and was alfo much employed in 
collieries and â€œ under-ground proje&s,â€ is believed to have been his grandfon.
But, his family alfo, con- 
fining of four children, two of whom married, is now nearly extindl ; and his property, which was not 
inconfiderable, all gone into other hands.
Our author is faid to have been happily beloved and refpefted by his parifhioners and neighbours.â€”.
One trait of his charadler is ftill remembered in the parifh: which ftiews him to have been, not only of a 
cheerful and convivial difpofition, but alfo a man of humour.
It was his conftant practice, after Sunday 
afternoon prayers, to accompany the leading men of his parifh to the adjoining ale-houfe, where each man 
fpent a penny, and only a penny : that done, he fet the younger fort to play at foot- ball, (of which he 
was a great promoter) and other ruftical diverfions.
However much at variance this may be deemed 
from modern maxims and manners, it fhould be recolle&ed, as an apology for Mr. Robinfonâ€™s indulging 
in it, that this mode of fpending the fabbath after the fervices of the church were over, (which there ia

THE PARISH OF ADDINGHAM.
A Name, according to Dr. Todd, <f derived from a remarkable monument of 
â€œ antiquity on the top of the hill, nigh to the place where the church now 
(lands, where there is a circle offtones, fomething like Sronehenge, in Wiltlhire: 
â€œ Aldingham,//^-/j/Â«g-^7;?,t fignifying a habitation nigh the hanging (tones, op- 
â€œ pidum ad lapides antiquum penfiles .â€ â€” As this is the largeft monument of the kind 
we have ever heard of, in order to fhew its great antiquity, and if pofiible to dilcover 
the original intention and rife of it, we will compare it with others in Britain, 
as treated of by learned antiquaries.
It is formed onthefummit of an eminence, on an inclining plane, facing to the 
eaft.
â€” The hills on that fide, at the diftance of two miles, overlook it.
â€” It lies open 
to the fouth, and may be feen at the diftance of feveral miles, on the road from 
Temple-Sowerby to Penrith; and it is alfo open towards the north, fo as to be 
difcovered at the diftance of feveral miles.
On account of the inclination of the 
ground on which it (lands, and the very deep afcent, by which you rife from the 
river Eden to Little Salkeld, you cannot fee it on your approach, till you are juft: 
upon it.
Part of the ground within the area of the monument is ploughed, and 
heretofore the fences of the fields interfered it, (o that from no quarter a proper 
view of the whole circle could be had, to take a drawing of it; but Mr. Lacy, to 
gratify the curious, is removing thofe obftacles.
reafon to believe were then far more ftricily and conftantly attended, than is now the fafhion) was a&ually

oppofition to the puritanical ideas refpe&ing the obfervance of the fabbath, fo different from all the reft 
of Chriftendom, which were then but beginning to be countenanced.
Mrs. Robinfon is not remembred with equal refpeft.
She is faid, in pure Cumberland pharfeology, 
to have been a Jimple viatterlefs body: by which is meant, not only that her underftanding was ordinary, 
but that {he wanted management, and was helplefs.

[Leath Ward.
This monument is called, by the country people, Long Meg and hei Daughters : 
> â€” it forms nearly an exadt circle of three hundred and fifty paces in circumference, of 
mafiy ftones, mod of which remain (landing upright.
Thefe are fixty-feven in num- 
ber, of various qualities and fpecies, not hewn nor touched with a tool; and their 
form fhews they were gathered from the furface of the earth: fome are of blue 
and grey limeftone: fome flint, but mod of them are granites â€” many ofthofe that 
are handing meafure from twelve to fifteen feet in girt, and ten feet in height: â€” 
others much lefs in fize.
â€” At the fouthern fide of this circle, about the difiance of 
17 paces from its neareft part, is an upright column, naturally of a fquare form, of 
red freeftone, with which the country abounds, and of which there is a fine quarry 
known to the Romans at Crazudunda/e , not many miles diftant from this monu- 
ment.* This fione is placed with one of its angles towards the circle; is near 
fifteen feet in girt, and eighteen feet high ; each angle of its fquare anfwering to 
a cardinal point of the compafs.
In that part of the circle, which is moft conti- 
guous to the column, four large fiones form a fquare figure, as if they had fup- 
ported fome table fione, or had inclofed a fpace more particularly kept holy than 
the reft.
Towards the eaft, weft, and north, two ftones of great magnitude are 
placed in the circle, at a greater diftance from each other, than thofe in other 
parts, as if intended efpecially for entrances into this myftic round.
What cre- 
ates great aftoniftiment to the fpeeftator is, that the whole face of the adjacent 
country does not fiiew any ftones of the like magnitude or quality; and how fuch 
immenfe bodies could be moved, in an age when little of the mechanical powers 
(except the force of the lever) were known in this country, is not to be conceived.
Whilft we flood admiring this place, the following thoughts naturally occurred 
to our memory : â€” 
â€œ Time-hallowâ€™d pile, by fimple builders rearâ€™d!
â€œ Myfterious round, through diftant times reverâ€™d!
Â«* Ordainâ€™d with earthâ€™s revolving orb to laftj

Dr. Ogilvie's Fame of the Druids.

â€œ This wide circus,

In Nicolfon and Burn, this wonderful circle is deferibed to be â€œ about eighty 
Â« yards diameter,â€ and that it confifts â€œ of about feventy two ftones, from above 
Â« three yards high, to lefs than fo many feet.â€ â€” There is no need of a doubtful

exprefllon touching the number; the whole monument certainly confifts of fixty 
feven (tones.
â€” " There is one (tone larger than the reft, which ftands about forty 
â€œ yards from the circle towards the fouthweft, being four yards in height, and near 
â€œ two yards fquare at the bottom, and is hollow at the top , like a di/h , or Roman 
â€˜ f altar â€ We examined the top of the column, and there is not now any 
hollow there, like the focus of the Roman altar, nor is it probable there ever 
was any.
â€” ( See the engraving.)â€”*- The fame authors thus proceed; " Docftor 
,c Todd farther obfervesf that the northern people, as the Scythians, Scandians, 
â€œ and others, who were moft tenacious of ancient cuftoms, and from whom the 
<f Britons are more immediately defcended, did endeavour to perpetuate the me- 
â€œ mory of all their great affairs, as the inauguration of their kings, the burials of 
" their generals and nobles, or victories over their enemies, by railing and ordering 
** (tones and pyramids of prodigious magnitude.
We are told that the election of 
â€œ a king of Denmark, in ancient times, was commonly had in this folemn manner.
ct As many of the nobles as were fenators, and had power to give their votes, agreed 
â€œ upon fome convenient place in the fields; where, leating themlelves in a circle , 
<f upon fo many great (tones, they gave their votes.
This done, they placed their 
â€œ new elcdted monarch upon a (tone higher than the reft, either in the middle of 
â€œ the circle, or at (ome (mall diftance at one fide, and faluted him king.
In 
â€œ Iceland, to this day, there is fuch a company of (tones, which bear the name of 
â€œ King-flolen , or the kingâ€™s feat.
Near St Buriens, in Cornwalll, in a place which 
" the Cornilhmen called Bifcowe Woune , are to be feen nineteen (tones fet in a circle, 
rf diflant every one about twelve feet from the other, and in the very centre, one 
â€œ pitched far higher and bigger than the reft.
So in Roilrich-flones, in Oxford lh ire, the 
" largeft (tone is at fome little diftance from the circle.
From all which, Dr. Todd 
â€œ concludes, that fome Danifh or Saxon king was elected here for Cumberland.
â€œ All which may be very true, and yet thefe places not foley fet apart for the 
â€œ inauguration of their kings, but for many other folemn rites and obfervances; 
â€œ and generally, they feem to have been places dedicated to religions rites: It 
" is well known, that the Druids, in this kingdom, performed their adorations in 
â€œ the open air, and within this kind of inclofure.
And the hollow or bafon in the 
â€œ top of the largeft Itone here feemeth fomewhat to confirm this notion, as being 
â€œ intended for a place of facrifice and oblation.â€ 
We come now in the next place to confider what Camden and his editors fay of 
this monument.^ 
** After Eden has received the Eimot, it haftens to the north by little inconfider- 
<f able villages and forts, to the two Salkelds.
At little Salkeld there is a circle of 
" fiones, feventy feven in number , each ten feet high; and before thefe , at the entrance , 
â€œ a fingle one , by itf elf fifteen feet high.
L his the common people call Long Meg, and the 
* From this expreflion, it is evident they copied the whole from Dr. Todd.
f In the middle of the circle, are two round plots of ground, of a different colour from the reft, and 
more ftony and barren.
Towards Glaffonby is a fine fpring, and another furrounded by a large but fhallovr 
fofTe and vallum.
â€” Southwell from this work, in the next inclofure, is a fmaller circle of 20 ftones, 50 feet 
diameter, and at fome diftance above it, another fingle ftone, regarding it as Meg does her circle.

" ref her daughters : and within this circle are two heaps of fiones, under which they 
â€œ fay there are dead bodies buried /â€™ â€œ and indeed it is poflible enough that this has 
** been a monument erecfted in memory of fome victory.
But as to thofe heaps in 
â€œ the middle, they are no part of the monument, but have been gathered off the 
lf ploughed lands adjoining, and, as in many other parts of the country, thrown up 
â€œ here in a wafte corner of the field.
And as to the occafion of it, both this and 
" Rollrich Stones , in Qxfordfhire, are iuppofed by many to have been monuments 
" ere&ed at the folemn inveftiture of fome Danifh kings, and of the fame kind as 
â€œ th e King-folen, in Denmark, and Morefeen, in Sweden, concerning which feverai 
â€œ large difcourfes have been written,â€ 
This monument is very fuperficially mentioned in the antiquarian Repertory, 
vol.
I. p.
239, and the plate given of it is but a very faint reprefentation : fuch 
particulars in that defcription as are worth notice are, â€” " That the column called 
Meg weighs about fixteen tons and a half,â€ â€” this is calculated on the fuperficial 
meafure of what appears above the earthâ€™s furface.
â€” <c The fame ridiculous ftory 
â€œ is told of thefe (tones, as of thofe at Stonehenge i.
e. that it is impoffible to count 
* c them, and that many perfons who have made the trial, could never find them 
â€œ amount twice to the fame number.
It is added, that this was a holy place, and 
* f that Long Meg and her Daughters were a company of witches transformed into 
* c ftones, on the prayers of fome faint, for venturing to profane it:â€ fuch are the 
* f trifles with which the public are amufed.
It is from a comparifon with other monuments in this ifland, of an apparently 
fimiliar kind, that we are moft likely to form a true judgment of that which is now 
under confideration : this will excufe us to the reader for fome degree of famenefs, 
and perhaps prolixity, which muft neceffarily attend fuch an inveftigation.
â€” 
Rollrich has been named ; we will therefore firft attend to what authors have faid 
on that monument.
â€œ Eventide, a fmall rivulet, leaves in this utmoft borders of the county (to the 
â€œ north- weft) a great monument of antiquity; a number of vaftly large ftones, 
<f placed in a circular figure, which the country people call Roll-rich Stones, and 
Â«* have a fond tradition, that they were once men, and were turned into ftones.
Â« They are irregular, and of unequal height, and, by the decays of time, are grown 
â€œ ragged and very much impaired.
The higheft of them which lies out of the 
%t ring to the eaft, they call the king, becaufe they fancy he fhould have been 
King of England, if he could have feen Long Compton, a village w'hich is in 
** view at a very few fteps further; five large ftones, which, on one fide of the circle, 
Â«* are contiguous to one another, they pretend were knights or horfmen, and the 
Â«Â« others common foldiers.
â€” [It is * a Angle circle of ftones, with epiftyles or 
architraves, and of no very regular figure.
Exceptf one or two, the reft of them arc 
Â« f not above four feet and a half high.
What the occafion of this monument might 
<* be, is not hinted at by any infcription upon the ftones, nor by any other marks 
Â«* about them : which feems to make it probable, at leaft, that it was not ere< 5 ted

Extract from the Manufcripts of Roger Gale, Efq.
From Mr. GALE to Dr. STUKELY.
Â« SIR, 
â€œ Laft Saturday morning I had the fatisfacflion of feeing the ftones 
" called Rollrich , which are but a molehill to a mountain, if compared with thofe 
â€œ we faw at Stonehenge and Abury, as I doubt not you will agree, upon my giving 
" you the beft defcription I can of them, as alfo that they have been entirely of 
â€œ another nature and defign.
They are pitched upon the top of a hill, about half 
â€œ a mile fouth-eaft of a village called Long Compton, juft within a hedge that 
â€œ now parts a ploughed field from a heath.
They compofe a ring not exactly cir- 
** cular, the diameter of it from north to fouth, being thirty-five yards, and from 
â€œ eaft to weft but thirty-three.
The ftones are of very unequal dimenfions, both 
" in height and thicknefs, few of them exceeding four feet in altitude, and fome 
â€œ of them reaching fcarce two; the breadth of them is fo various, that I muft have 
â€œ meafured every one to have given it you ; neither can I tell you the original 
<f number, fome being thrown down and broken, and others carried away : but 
â€œ there are now twenty-two (landing, and fome of them pitched fo clofe together, 
â€œ edge by edge, that it is evident they were intended to form a clofe wall.
The 
â€œ thicknefs of them is not above fourteen or lixteen inches at the moil.
Where 
â€œ the entrance of it was, is hard to fay pofitively, there being at prefent many 
â€œ fmooth gaps in the ring, but as there is a large one diredfly north-eaft, in a 
â€œ line with the King, as they call it, 1 am perfuaded it was in that place.
This King 
â€œ is a great ftone, which the country people fancies to reprefent a man on horfe- 
â€œ back, (landing eighty-four yards north-eaft from the circle, eight feet high, feven 
" broad in the broadcftpart, and about twelve inches thick, and has, as appears by 
f See Cornwall.

I had like to have forgot, that juft in the north point of the circle, is 
<f alfo Handing one done much larger than the red, being feven feet high, and five 
ct inches and half broad.
I could obferve no trench running round it, which, ii' 
,c there ever had been one, mud dill have fhewn itfelf upon the heath ; nor any 
â€œ marks of an avenue leading to it, as at Stonehenge or Abury, nor any barrows 
â€œ or tumuli within view of it, only a bank to the north of the King about ten 
t( yards, in length about twenty yards, and in breadth feven, fiat, but uneven at 
â€œ the top, as if formed out of the rubbidi of the neighbouring quarry : in all pro- 
<c bability it is as ancient as the King himfelf, 1 mean cad up at the fame time that 
â€œ he was eretded there, the country tradition joining them both together in a rhyme, 
u in every bodyâ€™s mouth: â€” 
" If Long Compton thou cand fee, 
â€œ Then King of England thou {halt be.â€ 
<Â£ You cannot fee Long Compton where this king Hands, but if you dep but a 
,c yard to the north of him, it difcovers itfelf over the top of this bank, which in- 
â€œ tercepted your view of it.

<f Your mod humble fcrvant, 
IForcefier, Augujl 19, 1719,â€ â€œ ROGER GALE.
The next fubjedl of this fort to be confidered in this comparifon is Stone-henge, 
in Wiltdiire.
Camden and his editor give the following account : 
About fix miles north of Salifbury, on the plains, is to be feen infana JubfiruRio 
Â« (to ufe Ciceroâ€™s words) that is a wild kind of ftrudlure.
For within a trench, 
" are placed huge unhewn dones, in three circles, one within another, in the figure 
â€œ of a crown, fome whereof are twenty-eight feet in height, and feven in breadth, on 
" which others like architraves are borne up, fo that it feems to be a hanging pile ; 
â€œ from whence we call it Stonehenge , as the ancient hidorians, from its greatnefs, 
Â« f call it Gigantum Chorea, the giantâ€™s dance.
[It is fituated on a rifing ground, 
â€œ environed with a deep trench, dill appearing, and about thirty feet broad.
Â«* From the plain it has had three entrances, the mod confiderable of them lying 
â€œ north-ead ; at each of which were raifed, on the outfide of the trench, two huge 
,c dones gateways ; parallel whereunto, on the infide, were two others of lefs pro- 
<f portion.
After one has pafied this ditch, he afeends thirty-five yards, before he 
â€œ comes at the work itfelf, which confids of four circles of dones.
The outward 
â€œ circle is about one hundred feet diameter, the dones whereof are very large; 
â€œ four yards in height, two in breadth, and one in thicknefs.
Two yards and a 
â€œ half within this great circle, is a range of leder dones.

Â» f the principal part of the work, called, by Mr. Inigo Jones, The Cell , of an irre- 
lâ€˜ gular figure, made up of two rows of fiones ; the outer of which conlifts of great 
u upright fiones, in height twenty feet, in breadth two yards, and in thicknefs one 
â€œ yard.
Thefe are coupled at the top by large tranfome fiones, like architraves, 
" which are feven feet long, and about three and a half thick.
Within this was 
â€œ alfo another range of leffer pyramidal fiones, of about fix feet in height.
In the 
Â«* inmoft part of the Cell, Mr, Jones obferved a fione (which is now gone) ap- 
â€œ pearing not much above thefurface of the earth, and lying towards the eafi, four 
â€œ feet broad, and fixteen feet long.] 
â€œ Our countrymen reckon this among the wonders of the nation.
For it is un- 
*Â« accountable, how fuch fiones fhould come there, (feeing all that country wants or- 
*Â« dinary fiones for building) and by what means they were raifed.
Of thefe things 
*Â« I (hall not attempt any exacfi account, but only lament, that the founders of this 
noble monument cannot be traced out.
Yet it is the opinion of fome, that 
â€œ thefe fiones are not natural, or fuch as are dug out of the quarries, but artificial 
â€œ of fine fand, cemented together by a glewy fort of matter; like thofe monu- 
â€œ ments which I have feen in Yorkfiiire.â€ â€” â€œ And this is no new thing; for do 
Â«' we not read in Pliny, that the fand of Puteoli, if covered with water, is prefently 
â€œ turned into fione ?
And that the cifterns at Rome, being made of fand and ftrong 
" lime, are fo tempered, that they feem to be real fione ?
And that fmall pieces 
â€œ of marble have been fo cemented, that fiatues made of it have been taken for 
" one entire piece of marble.
[How ever others who have viewed them, and par- 
" ticularly Mr. Inigo Jones, who hath written an entire difcourfe concerning them, 
Â«Â« affirm that they are purely natural.] The tradition is, that Ambrofius Aurelia- 
Â« nus, or Uther his brother, erefted it by the help of Merlin, the mathematician, 
â€œ in memory of the Britons there (lain by treachery, in conference with the Saxons, 
Â« From whence Alexander Necham, a poet of the middle age, in a poetical way, 
** but without any great fancy, made the following verfes, grounding them on the 
â€œ Britiffi Hiftory of Geoffrey : â€”

ACCOUNT OF THE MASSACRE AT STONEHENGE, 
From the ancient Hijlory of Great Britain.
Hengift (a fubtile and malicious man) upon return of his embafly, under colour of peace, devifed the 
fubverfion of all the nobility of Britain, and chofe out, to come to this aflembly, his faithfulleft and 
hardieft men, commanding every one of them to hide, under his garment, a long knif (or as the Britifh 
hiftory is, in their britches) as long as their thies; with which, when he (hould give the watch-word nymyd 
ywr Sexys, he commanded that every one Ihould kill the Briton next him.
Both Tides met upon the day 
appointed, and trealing earneftly upon the matter, Hengift fodenly gave the watch-word, and fodenly 
caught Vortiger by the coller ; and the Saxons with their long knives, violently murdered the innocent 
and unarmed Britons, none of them having on him fo much as a knif.
At what tyme ther were thus 
treacheroufly murdered, of earls and noblemen of the Britons 460.
And neverthelefs ther were many 
Saxons then flain by the Britons, with ftones ther taken up; wher Aldol earl of Gloucefter, or Caer-gloin, 
gote into his hands a ftake, and flew therwith 70 Saxons, and then efcaped home to his own city.
Her- 
upon Hengift detained Vortiger in prifon, in irons, until, for his ranfom, he delivered four of his chiefeft 
citys and chiefeft forts, (viz.) London, York, Lincoln, and Winchefter.
Wherupon, they miferably 
wafted the provinces belonging to thos citys.
And Hengift, from thensfurth, made Kent the feat of his 
kingdom.
And Vortiger (as Sigebert Saieth) departed into Wales, A.
D. 439.
DESCRIPTION OF STONEHENGE.
From Dr. Stukelyâ€™s â€œ Stonehenge , a Temple refored to the Britifi Druids .â€ 
The ftones of which it is compofed, are not factitious, for that would have been a greater wonder, than 
to bring them together to the place where they are ; but undoubtedly were brought fifteen or fixteen miles, 
of prodigious fize as they are, from thofe called the Grey Wethers, near Aubury, or Marlborough downs, 
all the greater ftones, except the altar, being of that fort ; for that being defigned to refift fire, is of a fmall 
harder kind: it is a compofition of cryftals, of red, green, and white colours, cemented by nature with 
opaque granules, of flinty or ftony matter.
The ftone at the upper end of the cell, which is fallen down 
and broken in half, the Docftor tells us, weighs above forty ton, and would require above 140 oxen to draw 
it: judge then what a ftupendous labour it was, to bring together, fo many miles, fuch a number as were 
ufed here: and this has induced many inconfiderate- people to imagine, that the founders had an art of 
making ftone, which has been loft for many ages.
The prefent name is Saxon, though the work is beyond all comparifon older, fignifying an hanging rorj, 
ipr pole,' i.
e. a gallows, from the hanging parts of the architraves, or rather impofts, as pendulous rocks

appearance is awful; but as you come up the avenue, on the northeaft fide of it, which fide is moft perfect,

having parted, we afeend thirty five yards before we come at the work.
When you enter the building, whether on foot or on horfeback,and caft your eyes around upon the yawn- 
ing ruins, you are ftruck into a reverie, which no one can deferibe, and they only can be fenfible of, who 
feel it.
Other buildings fall by piece meal, but here a fingle ftone is a ruin.
Yet, there is as much un- 
demolilhed, as enables us fufficiently to recover its form, when in its moft perfeft ftate.
When we ad- 
vance further, the dark part of the ponderous impofts over our heads, the chafms of iky between the 
jambs of the cell, the odd conftruCtion of the whole, and greatnefs of every part furprife.
If you 
look upon the perfeft part, you fancy entire quarries mounted up into the air; if on the rude havoc below, 
you fee, as it were, the bowels of a mountain turned infide out.
The whole work being of a circular form, is about 108 feet in diameter from out to out.
The intention 
of the founders was this, the whole circle was to confift of thirty {tones, each ftone to be four cubits broad, 
each interval two cubits; thirty times four cubits is twice fixty, thirty times two cubits is fixty; fo that 
thrice fixty cubits complete a circle, whofe diameter is fixty.
A ftone being four cubits broad and two 
thick, is double the interval, which is a fquare of two cubits.
Change the places between the ftones and 
their intervals, and it will make a good ground plot for a circular portico of Greek or Roman work ; though 
thefc bodies of ftone, which are in the nature of impofts, or cornices, never had, or were intended to have 
any moulding upon them, like Greek or Roman work; they are wrought perfectly plain, and fuitable to 
the ftones that fupport them; and the chiffeling of the upright ftones is only above ground; for the four 
or five feet in length below ground, is left in the original natural form.
The upright ftones are made very 
judiciouflv to diminifh a little way; fo that at the top they are but three cubits and a half broad, and fo 
much nearer, as to meet a little over the heads of the uprights, both within fide and without; by which 
means the uprights are lefs liable to fall or fwerve.
It is to be feared, fome indifereet people have been digging about the great entrance, with the ridicul- 
ous hopes of finding treafure; and fo have loofened the chalky foundation; for the upper edge of the 
import; overhangs no lefs than two feet feven inches, which is very conliderable in an height of eighteen.
The whole breadth at the foundation, is but two feet and a half; and this noble front is now chiefly kept 
up by the mafonry of the mortice and tenon of the impofts.
The contrivance of the founders, in making mortices and tenons between the upright ftones and the im- 
pofts is admirable; but fo contrary to any practice of the Romans, that it alone overfets their claim to 
the work.
Thefe tenons and mortices of this outer circle are round, and fit one another very aptly.
They are ten inches and a half in diameter, and refemble half an egg, rather than an hemifphere; and fo 
effectually keep both uprights and impofts from luxation, that they muft have been thrown down with great 
difficulty and labour.
The whole height of upright and import i3 ten cubits and a half; the upright nine ; 
the impoft over the grand entrance is, in its middle length, eleven feet ten inches, and fo is larger than the 
reft; and it is alfo a little broader, meafuring on the infide.
Of the outer circle of Stonehenge, which, in its perfection, confifted of fixty ftones, thirty uprights, 
and thirty impofts, there are feventeen uprights left (landing, eleven of which, remain contiguous by the 
grand entrance; five impofts upon them.
One upright at the back of the temple, leans upon a ftone of 
the inner circle.
There are fix more lying upon the ground, whole or in pieces; fo that twenty four, out 
of thirty, are {bill vifible at the place.
There is but one impoft more at its proper place, and but two 
lying upon the ground; fo that twenty two are carried off.
Hence it is inferred, this temple was not de- 
faced when Chriftianity prevailed; but that fome rude hands carried away the ftones for other ules.
So 
much for the larger circle of ftones with impofts.

â€œ Jones pleafes himfelf with retrieving a piece of architecture of Vitruvius, he 
â€ abufes his reader by a falfe fcheme of the whole work.
For the cell is not of an 
exact hexagonal figure, but very irregular, and comes nearer a heptagon ; lo that 
â€œ the whole work cannot be formed upon the bafis of four equilateral triangles, 
â€œ as 
As to the lefTer circle, which never had any imports, it is fomewhat more than eight feet from the infide 
of the outward one, and conlifts of forty leffer ftones; forming with the outward circle, as it were, a cir- 
cular portico, a molt beautiful work, and of a pretty effett; they are flat parallelograms, as thole of the 
outward circle; and their general and deflgned proportion is two cubits, or two and a half, as fuitable 
ftones were found.
They are a cubit thick, and four and a half high, which is more than feven fo.t; 
this was their ftated proportion, being even- way the half of the upper uprights.
Thefe ftones are of a 
harder compoiition than the reft, the better to rc Alt' violence, as they are lefter; and they have fufficicnt 
faftening in the ground.
There are but nineteen of the forty left; but ten of them, are Handing in fitu, 
five in one place contiguous, three in another, and two in another.
The walk between thefe two circles, which is three hundred feet in circumference, is very noble and 
very delightful.
The adytum, or cell, into which we may fuppofe none but the upper order of the Druids were to enter, 
is compofed of certain compages of ftones, which he calls tvilithons, becaufe made each of 2 upright ftones, 
with an impoft at top, and there are manifeftly five of thefe remaining; three of which are entire, two are 
ruined in fome meafure; but the ftones remain in fitu.
It is a magnificent nitch, twenty feven cubits long, 
and as much broad, meafuring in the wideft place.
The ftones that compofe it are really ftuper.dous, 
their height, breadth, and thicknefs, are enormous; and to fee fo many of them placed together in a nice 
and critical figure with exa&nefs; to conlider as it were, not a pillar of one ftone, but a whole wall, a 
fide, an end of a temple of one ftone; to view them curioufly, creates fuch a motion in the mind, as words 
cannot exprefs, One very remarkable particular in the conftitution of this adytum has efcaped all ob- 
fervers before Dr. Stukely, which is this: as this part is compofed of trilithons, fet two and two on each 
fide, and one right before, they rife in height and beauty of the ftones from the lower end of the adytum 
to the upper end; that is, the two hithermoft trilithons correlponding, or thofe next the grand entrance, 
on the right hand and on the left, are exceeded in height by the two next in order ; and thofe are ex- 
ceeded by that behind the alter, in the upper end of this choir; and their heights refpedtively, are thir- 
teen cubits, fourteen cubits, fifteen cubits.
The impofts of thefe are all the fame height, and ten cubits may be fuppofedto be their medium mea- 
fure in length.
The artifice of the tenors and mortices of thefe trilithons and their impofts, what con- 
formity they bear to that of the outer circle is exceeding pretty, every thing being done very geometri- 
cally, and as would belt anfwer every purpofe from plain and fimple principles ; and it is wonderful that, 
in the management of fuch prodigious ftones as thefe are fixed in the ground and rammed in like pofts, 
there is not more variation in the height, diftance, See.
Of thefe greater ftones of adytum, as is obferved before, there are none wanting, being all on the fpot, 
ten uprights and five cornices.
The trilithon firft on the left hand is entire in fitu, but vaftly decayed, 
efpecially the cornice in which fuch deep holes are corroded, that in fome places the daws make their 
nefts in them.
The next trilithon on the left is entire, compofed of three moll beautiful ftones.
The 
cornice happening to be of a very durable Englilh marble, has not been much impaired by the weather.
The Doctor took a walk on the top of it ; but thought it a frightful fituation.
The trilithon of the upper 
end was an extraordinary beauty; but probably, through the indiferetion of fomebody digging between 
them and the altar, the noble impoft is diflodged from its airy feat, and fallen upon the altar, where its 
huge bulk lies unfraclured.
The two uprights that fupported it, are the moll delicate ftones of the whole 
work.
They were, our author thinks above thirty feet long, and well chiffeled, finely tapered, and 
proportioned in their dimenfions.
That .fouthward is broken in two, lying upon the altar: the other (till 
ftands entire, but leans upon one of the ftones of the inward oval: the root end, or nnhewn part of both is 
raifed fomewhat above ground.
The trilithon towards the weft is entire, except that fome of the end of 
the impoft is fallen off, and all the upper ledge is very much diminilhed by time.
The laft trilithon, on the 
right hand of the entrance into the adytum, has fuffered much.
The outer upright being the jamb of 
the entrance, is itill Handing; the other upright and impoft are both fallen forward into the adytum, and 
broken-

â€œ as Mr. Jones fuppofed.
Neither are the entrances inro the trench fo regular and 
â€œ fo equidiftant as the author would make them.

* f doubts (which may be raifed from the order of the building) be refolved, and 
â€œ till we arc allured, from good authority, that the Romans ufed to build fuch 
broken each into three pieces, as fuppofed from digging near it.
That which is Handing has a cavity in it, 
in which two or three perfons may fit warm from the weather.
Stonehenge is compofcd of two' circles, and two ovals, refpeclively concentric.
The Hones that form 
thefe ovals rife in height, as nearer the upper end of the adytum, and their mediate meafure is four cubits 
and four palms.
They are of a much harder kind than the larger Hones in the Idler circle ; the founders no 
doubt intending, that their leffer bulk Ihould be compenlated by folidity.
Of thefe only fix are remaining 
upright: thoâ€™ Humps of two are left on the fouth fide of the a'kar ; one lies behind the altar dug up,or thrown 
down by the fall of the upright there.
One or two were probably thrown down by the fall of the upright 
of the fird trilithon on the right hand; a Hump of another remains, by the upright there Hill Handing.
The whole number, of Hones may be thu6 computed: the great oval confilts of ten uprights; the inner 
with the altar, of twenty: the great circle of thirty, the inner of forty, which are one hundred upright 
Hones; five impoHsof the great oval, thirty of the great circle, the two Hones on the bank of the area; 
the Hone lying within the entrance of the area, and that Handing without; there feems to be another lying 
on the ground, by the \allum of the court, diredfly oppofiteto the entrance ol the avenue; all added to- 
gether make juft one hundred and forty Hones, the number of which Stonehenge, a whole temple is ccmpo- 
fcd.
Behold the folution of the mighty problem !
the magical fpell which has fo long perplexed the vulgar, 
is broken!
they think it an ominous thing to count the true number of the Hones, and whoever does fo, 
fhall certainly die after it !
As to the altar, it is laid toward the upper end of the adytum, at prefent Hat on the ground, and fqueczed 
into it, as it were, by the weight of the ruins upon it.
It is a kind of blue coarfe marble, fuch as comes

Its breadth is about two cubits

trilithon before which it lies, but it is very difficult to come at its true length.
It is twenty inches thick, 
a juH cubit, and has been fquared.
It lies between the two centres, that of the compafles, and that of 
the Hring; leaving a convenient fpace quite round it, no doubt as much as was neceffary for this 
adminiHration.
The heads of oxen, deer, and other beaHs have been found, upon digging in and about Stonehenge,

till now, would have been an invaluable cunofity.
In the year 1 635, as they were ploughing by the bar- 
rows, about Normanton ditch, they found fo large a quantity of excellent pewter, as, at a low price, they

Thefe pewter plates might very pofiibly, have been tablets with ir.fcriptions, but

No doubt, fays 
Dr. fctukely, this was fome of the old BritiHi fiannum, which the Tyrian Hercules , firnamed Melcarthus , 
firH brought ex Cajjiteride Infula , or Britain: which Hercules lived in Abrahamâ€™s time, or foon after.
Mr. Webb tells us, the Duke of Buckingham, dug about Stonehenge, perhaps, much to the prejudice 
of the work.
Mr. Webb alio did the like, and found, what be imagined was the corner of a thuribulum.
Mr. Haywood, late owner of Stonehenge, likewife dug about it, and found heads of oxen, and other 
beaH bones and nothing elfe.
Dr. Stukely himfelf, in 1723, dug on the infide of the altar, about the middle, four feet along the 
edge of the Hone, fix feet forwards towards the middle of the adytum: at a foot deep he came to the folid 
chalk, mixed with flints, which had never been Hirred.

in two or three pieces by the ponderous maffes of the impolts, and one upright Hone of that tiilithon, which

they dug holes in the folid chalk, which would of itfelf keep up the Hones

â€œ Nor could it be built by the Danes ; as for many other reafons, fo particularly 
f< becaufe it is mentioned in fome manufcripts of Minnius; who, as every body 
" knows, wrote about two hundred years before the Danes were mafiers of any 
* c confiderable part of this ifiand.
Other arguments, which make againft this 
" may be found in Mr. Webbâ€™s Vindication of Stonehenge Refiored, wherein he 
" hath endeavoured, with great learning, to defend his father-in-law, Mr. Jonesâ€™s 
fcheme ; though that is in itfelf falfe.
" One great argument by which Mr. Jones eftablifhes his own opinion, is, that 
" it is a thing altogether improbable that the Britons could build fuch a monument.
Â« f But the contrary is evident from the fortification of Caracftacusâ€™s camp; from the 
â€œ vaft ftones mentioned by Dr. Plot to be in or near the Britifh city, or fortification, 
hard by Wrottefley, in Staffordfhire ; and from the parcels of ftones, (not unlike 
â€œ Stonehenge) that are in fome parts of Scotland and Wales, whither the Romans 
" and Danes never came.
It is true, thefe monuments have not their architraves, 
(which Stonehenge has, not only in the ftones round the cell, but alfo on the great 
â€œ ftones of the utmoft circle) and this makes it probable, that Stonehenge was 
* f built after theRomans came in, and in imitation of fome of their ftrucftures ; 
Â« c though as to the general part of the work, it appears to have been unartificial, 
f â€˜ and favours of their primitive rudenefs.
For that the Britons, among o:her 
ct parts of humanity and elegance, learned fomething of architecture from the Ro- 
tf mans, is plain from the Life of Agricola.
â€œ in that other point, namely, the occafion on which it was built ; it is eafier to 
â€œ confute thofe opinions that have already appeared, than to deliver a true one.
" There is no authority to convince us of the truth of what Nero Caefar, or Mr.
Â« c Pafchalâ€™s MS.
have laid down ; and it is not eafy to afient to the later Britifh 
â€œ writers, who tell us it was the fepulchre of the Britifh kings, or elfe raifed in 
â€œ memory of the Britons here mafiacred by the Saxons.
For, not to mention the 
Â« f improbability of what thofe authors have delivered, they tell us further that the 
â€œ kings buried, or Britons martyred, in this place w r ere Chriftians.
Nowâ€™ if fo, it is 
Â« ftiange that there fhould be no crofs, nor any other token of the Chriftian faith 
â€œ about this monument.
What reafon can be given, w'hy the furviving friends of 
thefe princes and nobles fhould not be careful of their memory, as they of the 
â€œ fame age were of King Arthurâ€™s, in whofe monument in Glafienbury, was 
Â« found fo diftinct an infcription ?
But what makes more againft this opinion are 
â€œ the afhes and pieces of burnt bones frequently found here ; by which it is plain, 
Â« that it could be no Chriftian burial place; lince facrifices and the cuftom 
â€œ of burning the dead grew out of ufe upon receiving the Chriftian faith.
â€œ For the name; Lelandâ€™s opinion that the Britifh one Choir Gaure , fhould not 
â€œ be tranflated Chorea Gigantinn , a choir of giants, but Chorea Nobilis , a noble 
â€œ choir; or elfe that Gaure is put for Vaure t which makes it Chorea Magna t a great

DRUIDâ€™s MONUMENT 
[Leath Ward, 
24O 
Â« About a mile from Silbury, is Aubury, a monument more confiderable in 
Â«* itfelf, than known to the world.
For a village of the fame name being built 
<f within the circumference of it, and by the way, out of its ftones too; what by 
â€œ gardens, orchards, inclofures, and the like, the profpeCt is fo interrupted, that it 
is very hard to difcover the form of it.
It is environed with an extraordinary 
â€œ vallum, or rampier, as great and as high as that at Winchefter; and within it is 
â€œ a graff, of a depth and breadth proportionable: from which we may infer, that it 
â€œ could not be defigned for a fortification, becaufethen the graff would have been 
â€œ on the outfide.
From the north to the fouth port are fixty paces, and as many 
â€œ from the weft port to the eaft.
The breadth of the rampier is four perches, 
and that of the graff the fame.
The graft hath been furrounded all along the 
tc edge of it with large ftones pitched on end, moft of which are now taken away; 
Â« but fome marks remaining, give liberty for a conjecture, that they flood quite 
â€œ round.
â€œ From this place to Weft Rennet, is a walk that has been inclofed on each fide 
Â« with large ftones; one fide at prefent wants a great many, but the other is al- 
Â«Â« moft, if not wholly entire : above which place, on the brow of the hill, is 
Â« another monument, encompaffed with a circular trench, and double circle of 
<c ftones, four or five feet high, the moft of them are now fallen down ; the dia- 
Â« f meter of the outer circle is forty yards, and of the inner fifteen.
Between Weft 
Â« Kennet and this place, is a walk much like that from Aubury thither, at leaf!
a 
â€¢< quarter of a mile in length.
About eighty yards from this monument, is an

DRUIDâ€™s MONUMENT.
u know I fhall receive many good hints and corredlions from you.
As you are a 
â€œ druid, and a fellow-labourer at Aubury, 1 fhall open to you part of the fecret of 
* f it, defiring you not to communicate it to any but druids.
The form of that 
ftupendous work is this: 
â€œ It is the pidlureof the Deity, more particularly of the Trinity, but moll par- 
<f ticularly what they anciently called The Father and the IFord , who created all 
* f things; this figure you find on the tops of all the obelifks, &c.
being equivalent 
â€œ to the Hebrew Tetra Grammaton.
A fnake proceeding from a circle, is the in- 
â€œ ternal proccfiion of the Son, from the firfi caufe.
The Egyptians frequently 
" added wings to it, then it was the trinity properly; but our ancefiors judged, I 
â€œ fuppofe, that they could not reprefent the wings well in ftonework, Co omitted 
them.
The Egyptians call this figure Hemp t ha % the Greeks in abbreviated 
â€œ writing ufed it for Damon , or the good Genius ; the Brachmans, in the Eaft 
f â€˜ Indies ufe it, the Chinefe, the ancient Ferfians, with whom it ftill remains at 
â€œ Perfepolis, the Americans, our Britons: this fihews it was extremely ancient : 
u but of all nations, our ancefiors have had the greatefi veneration for it, that they 
â€œ have expanded it in fo laborious a picture three miles long.
Now the ancients 
â€œ did no: only intend to pidlure out by it, the infinite power, wifdom, the inex- 
â€œ haufiablc fund of ideas, and the like, in the divine mind, but they adlually meant 
" by it the three eflences, or exifiences of the Supreme, w hich we call the Trinity: 
â€œ three perfonalities, two derivative from the firfi and felf-originated, but all eter- 
â€œ nal, infinite, &c.
confequently God. This is very eafy to be proved, for 
â€œ infiance, from Platoâ€™s calling the Sacred Perfon Word, Son, as much as Sr.
â€ John does ; and, no doubt, St. John ufes the fame exprefiion as Plato did, â€” 
â€œ Now the Word, when it is gone forth, is as much diftindl from the perfon whence 
u it proceeded, as a fon is diftindl from his father.
Both equally proceed from 
â€œ the Original, but after proceffion, are equally diftindl.
So again the Spirit, by 
â€œ which we mean the Holy Ghoft, which the Egyptians intended by the wings, 
f â€˜ and which Virgil means by his Spiritus intus alit , &c.
is a thing diftindl from

Near Boroughbridge, Rand three huge Rones, called by the country people the 
Devil's Arrows.
There was formerly four, but one of them was demolifiied fome 
time ago.
They are nearly in a line, and about a Rone-throw from each other : 
they are of the miln-Rone grit.
Mr. Morris removed the earth from the bafe of 
the largeR, but found nothing but pebbleRones and clay beat hard round it.
It 
was funk lix feet, and meafured, from the bafe to the top, thirty feet fix inches.
They Rand near the greateR military way the Romans had in Britain, called PVat~ 
ling-Jlreet : from this and many other reafons, he, as well as Dr. Gale, Dr. LiRer, 
Mr. Leland and others, are of opinion they are Roman, and are fepulchral monu- 
ments, or trophies of fome vidory.
Dr. Gibfon, Dr. Stillingfleet, and Dr. Plot, 
are of opinion they were Britifh works, ereCted in memory of fome battle fought 
there ; or Britifii deities, grounded upon the cuRom of the Phoenicians and Greeks, 
who were nations undoubtedly acquainted with Britain, before the arrival of the 
Romans, and who fet up unpolifhed Rones, inRead of images, to the honour of 
their gods.f 
There are many circular monuments in this ifiand, of different dimenfions : but 
we will detain the reader f urther on this fubjedl, with the addition only of another 
letter from Mr. Galeâ€™s manufcripts, and then attempt to deduce our own conclu- 
fions from the comparifons here drawn out, in order, as much as pofftble, to fiiew 
the original intention of the monument at Salke/d , and its antiquity.

Â« Agreeable to Lord Yefier and Sir Robert Murrayâ€™s relation, there are found, 
in the north of Scotland, tall, big, unpolifiied Rones, fet up on end, placed circu- 
â€œ larly, but not contiguous.
The obfcurer fort, which are the moR numerous, have 
â€œ but one circle of Rones, Randing at equal difiances; others, towards the fouth or 
Â« foutheafi, have a large broad Rone Randing on edge, which fills all betwixt two of 
u thofe ft ones on end, and is called the altar-Rone.
A third fort, moR remarkable, 
â€œ befides all others before-mentioned, have another circle of fmaller Rones, Rand- 
le ing within the circle of great ones.
The area of all the three forts is commonly 
Â«Â« filled with Rones of different fizes, confufedly heaped together.
The two largeR 
â€œ and moR remarkable of thefe monuments are to be feen at Auchincorthie, in the

It Teems evident, that the monument of Rollrich was conftructed by the fame 
people, and for the fame purpofes, as our Salkeld monument; the chief differ- 
ence is, that it is formed of quarry Rones, fet clofe fo as to make a complete 
fence, or bread-work ; our authorities are deficient in one point, not {hewing 
whether the ufe of the flat quarry ftones was from neceffity, the ftones of the na- 
ture of thofe at Salkeld, not being to be procured in the country.
But ir is to be 
obferved, that the Rollrich monument is but an infignificant objed compared to 
this before us, the dimenfions not being a third part fo extenfive, and the number 
of Rones bearing much the fame proportion.
The general idea of the people, who 
live in the neighbourhood of thefe monuments, is that they were erected on fome 
Angularly memorable occafion ; or were fupernatural works, having always been 
efleemed holy.
The monument of Stonehenge Teems clearly to have been of a different age, the 
work of another people, and for an appropriation of a different kind.
â€” The Chorea 
Giganhm, a name which we would tranllate or paraphrafe to that of Jlup endows 
choir ox gigantic theatre , from its amazing magnitude and fplendour, we humbly 
conceive, was the production of an age, when the Britons had acquired fome 
knowledge of architecture from the Romans.
The cromlitch y fuch as Kils-coiiy - 
houfe, which our bed antiquarians have agreed is a fepulchral monument, {hews 
that the tranfverfeor architrave Rone was ufed by the ancients; it might have fome 
fpecial emblematical import, loR to us in the diRance and darknefs of thofe ages.
This plan Teems to have been refined and improved by Roman model ; and the 
Stonehenge monument to be a mixture of the cromlitcb and Roman portico.
Its 
being chiffeled work proves that it was.
not deviled or executed by people of the 
fame religious tenets as thofe who raifed the facred places like this at Salkeld ; or, 
that from its appropriation, the working it with the tool, was not efieemed defiling 
and polluting of it.
Even this magnificent work, is much inferior to the fubjed 
before us, its whole diameter being no more than io 3 feet, whereas, the other, 
(computing without any certain Rridnefs three feet toa pace; for the irregularity 
of the ground, the then interfeding walls and Randing corn prevented our meafur- 
ing it with a chain) is 1050 feet in circumference, giving a diameter of 316 feet 
and upwards.
Paying great difference to the opinions of the learned who have 
written on the fubjed, we prefume that Stonehenge is a fepulchral monument, 
the Mau [oleum of kings ; and as in thofe ages great veneration w'as paid to the 
memory of the dead, and fuch was a facred office held by the Romans.
We 
doubt not that at Stonehenge, facrifices have been made to the manes of thofe who 
there lay entombed ; a cuRora perhaps ufed by the Britons by adoption, from the 
manners of the Romans, whom our anceRors Toon learned to imitate.
The monument at Anbury is next to be confidered.
There is indifputable 
evidence, thar it is of a very remote antiquity: the fituation of the ifland points 
out to us an idea, that we ffiould exped here, the chief works of the moR ancient 
inhabitants; and that their prefervation was moRly to be expeded, in fuch fitua- 
tions, as being befl and longeff proteded and defended by the natives.
Among 
the many excellent obfervarions of Dr. Stukely, one may plainly perceive him an 
enthufiaft 
Leath Ward.} 
DRUIDâ€™s MONUMENT.
Hi 
enthufiaft in matters of this kind.
His delineation of this place, leads us to cer- 
tain determinations concerning it ; but whether it was ever intended to reprefent 
the figure of the ferpent, which the ancients ufed as a type or emblem of the 
divine wifdom, we leave to the uninfluenced judgment of our readers; if we 
admit it was fo ; the temple forms the head, the centre or body contains the for- 
tified circle or city, and the avenues the remaining parts of that fymbol.
In our 
humble opinion, in Anbury we have the diffind remains, and form of an ancient 
Britifh city.
The larger circle was the fite of the city ftrongly fortified, with 
an outward vallum fixty-fix feet in width, within which is a ditch alfo fixty-fix 
feet wide, of a proportionable depth.
The inference that this could not be de- 
ligned for a fortification, doth not ftrike us in fo powerful a light, as it hath the 
editor of Camden ; for we cannot but conclude, it mud have been a fortification 
of extraordinary fliength, when we confidcr the edge of the ditch was uniformly 
Arengthened with a breafl-work of flones handing pitched on their ends: which 
was as powerful a defence as our battlements and embrazures.
Admitting that 
this place was furrounded with thick torefls, perhaps barricadoed with timber 
trees, felled and rudely piled up, and the arms of the aflailants, as well as of the 
gairifon, merely arrows, darts, handfpikes, and fwords, what place could be 
better fortified ?
The aflailant advancing over the rampier was expofed to the ar- 
rows of thofe behind the breafl-work, more than if he was.
advancing on a level 
plain, and the defender was covered with an inner rampier.
But conceiving the 
enemy had got o^r the rampier, and gained the ditch, how was the breafl-work 
or embrazure to be forced or gained?
The flrength of every fortification is to be 
calculated by the weapons ufed in aflault ; the fortifications of Aubury are incon- 
fiflent with modern infiruments of war, and yet excellent in the age in which they 
were conflruded.
â€” They had four gates or entrances â€” the approach, or grand 
road to the city, was fortified fora confiderable diflance â€” the via facra, which led 
to the temple, was alfo fecured, fo that the priefls and devotees might proceed in 
the face of the enemy to their holy offices, and offer facrifices to propitiate for the 
iafety of the fiate, and to execrate, or call down the curfes of heaven on the foe.
If we were to prefume this w'as all one entire holy work, we muff imagine a vafi: 
troop of priefts were employed, and an extravagant idea of their magnificence and 
power would take place.
What encourages the prefumption, that this was an 
ancient fortified city of the Britons, are the 'Tumuli, which are every w here Scatter- 
ed over ihe face of the country around it ; and the difeoveries frequently made of 
human remains near adjoining.
The Devil's Â£>iioites are certainly monuments of 
another people.
Mr. Strut, in his View of the Manners, &c.
of the Inhabitants of England, fays, 
â€œ I take the liberty of offering fome few' w ords concerning thofe venerable remains 
â€œ of antiquity, Stonehenge , Aubury , &c.
Dr. Stukely and Mr. Borlafe have, be- 
â€œ tween them, given a complete account of the ancient druids ; and Dr. Stukely 
â€œ has taken infinite pains to prove Stonehenge and Aubury to be not only of druid 
â€œ conftrudion, but that they were alfo the temples of worfliip of the druids.
Mr.
" Borlafe has partly agreed with the dodor in their being temples of worfliip, but 
â€œ imagines that they may alfo have been made' ufe of as courts of â€™judicature.
My 
â€œ thoughts 
246 
DRUIDâ€™s MONUMENT.
[Leath Ward.
** thoughts are, that they are beyond a doubt the rude dructures of the Britons, 
â€œ but 1 think they were intended as courts of judicature only.
All ancient authors 
ff have told us, that the temples of the druids were neither more nor lefs than a 
tf thick grove of oaks : or, at leaf!, if there fhould have been a rude temple, it was 
*â€¢ on a hill furrounded with oaken trees.
Indeed Mr. Borlafe has advanced an 
â€œ affertion, that would entirely confirm the doctorâ€™s opinion, when he fays, that 
â€œ Salifbury plain, however it is now a wild and barren plain, was anciently a thick 
â€œ wood; and in the middle of which wood he fuppofes Stonehenge to have been built.
u But 1 am afraid Mr. Borlafe has gone a little too far in his aflertion, to be able 
,f to keep pace with proofs.
Dr. Stukely himfelf did not dart fuch a conjecture, 
" but thought Caefar, (or rather the tranfcribers of Caefar) had miftakenly placed 
â€œ luco pro loco, a grove for a place.
In fhort (with all fubmiflion) the doctorâ€™s 
<( account is very learned and ingenious, but to me it does not feem conclufive, 
â€œ Alice he is obliged to gainfay the very authority that his flrongeft arguments are 
f â€˜ founded upon.
Caefar tells us that the druids of Gaul met once a-year at 
" Chartres, to determine fuch difficult matters in public aflemblies, as each druid 
rf had not been able to fettle.
Certainly thofe of England had alfo their annual 
,c meetings; for the fame author informs us, that the Gaulifh druids, in all re- 
ff fpeCts, refembled thole of Britain.
Allowing this, where can we fuppofe a bet- 
â€œ ter place for fuch a public affembly, than a large extenfive plain, w here all 
â€œ bufinefs might be tranfaCled in the fair face of day?
Neither does the fuppofed 
,r altar, or the burnt bones of animals found near it, in the lead: difprove thiscon- 
â€ je&ure; for it is very clear, that the druids never began any important bufinefs, 
" without fird facrificing to the gods.
Nor is the form and conffruClion in the lead: 
f< unfit for fuch a purpofe.
And for thofe of more common drudure, as Aubury, 
â€œ Rollrichj&c, they have been the courts of judicature for fuch particular provin- 
â€œ ces or kingdoms, where the druids of fuch provinces might meet at certain 
â€œ dated times, to determine publicly all fuch matters as might not require the 
,f decifion of the whole aflembly of the druids, &c.â€ 
It is probable the column called Meg , in the Salkeld monument, from its vicinity 
to the altar, was ufed for binding the victims : or it might be the mod holy mem- 
ber of this flrudure.
The pillar which Jacob fet up in the place w'here he had 
the holy vifion, is the fird dedication of this kind that we read of.
â€” He called the 
plac e Beth-el , which is condrued God himfelf , but implies the place of the divine 
prefence.
" And he took the done and fet it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon 
the top of it and Jacob vowed a vow, â€” ** This /lone, which I have fet up for a 
pillar, /hall be God's houfe .â€ â€” Thereby declaring, that from thenceforth, fandified 
by the prefence ol the Deity, and confecrated according to the mod folemn rites 
of that age, it fhould be edeemed holy, and held in the highed veneration.
Such, 
perhaps, was the confecration of this obelifk ; and the adjoining circle of dones, 
the place allotted for convention.
On few' topics has there been fuch a profufion of learning exerted, at lad, per- 
haps, but to little purpofe, as has been employed in the inveffigating the hidory of 
druids and druidifm.
They left no written hiffories of themfelves : hence all that 
is in the pow'er of the mod learned and diligent enquirers, is, tocolletffa few

fcattered notices of them, ftom the writers of other ages and other countries, who 
happen incidentally to have mentioned them ; and from their own monuments of 
themfelves, more durable at lead, than any written records.* From an immenfe 
mafs of materials, we fhall here feled fome brief particulars, which we are willing 
to hope, may throw fome light on thofe ftupendous remains of druidical magni- 
ficence, Long Meg and her Daughters.
Caefar, who took mod of his information refpecding our aboriginal progenitors 
from hearfay, fpeaks difparagingly of the literature of the druids.
Of this quef- 
tionable fabt, our great Milton declares, he finds no evidence but Caefarâ€™s ; which 
is alfo partly contradicted by his cotemporary Cicero, who tedifies, that he himfelf 
had known one of them, â€œ qui et nature rationem , quam Phyjiologiam Graci appcl- 
" lani, not am ejfe jibi profit e b atur ; et parlim auguriis parlim conjechira , que ejfent 
" futura dicebat.â€ There is, on the contrary, good evidence inducing us to believe, 
that, like Mofes, they were learned in all the wifdom of the Egyptians , and were 
mighty in words and deeds.
Their religion was the religion of Noah, and the antediluvian world.
It all 
terminated in the wordiip of the invifible Deity.
Admitting of no image, they 
ex prefled all their ideas as to religious worfhip by fymbols.
If their acknowledge- 
ment of the one true God was adulterated with the mixture of fome mere human 
inventions and follies, dill it was far lefs foolifh, and lefs impure, than the grofs 
mythology of the Greeks and Romans.
Selden, in his notes on Draytonâ€™s Polyolbion, 
fays, all their invocations were made to the one all-healing y or all-faving Power.
Dr. Borlafe has traced a furpridng conformity in the temples, prieds, docdrines, 
and worlhip of the Perfian magi and the Britifh druids.
This conformity is indeed 
fo driking and extraordinary, that Pelloutier, in his Hidory of the Celts, will have 
it, that the Perfians and the Celts were originally one and the fame people.
Major 
Vallancey is of the fame opinion; adding, that the druids fird flourifhed in the 
ead, â€” in Hindodan, as Brachmans, f in Babylon and Aflyria, as Chaldees , and in 
Perfia, as Magi , â€” and from thence came hither with that great body of Perfian- 
Scythians, whom the Greeks call Phoenicians.
He farther thinks, that they fird: 
fettled in Ireland ; and from thence migrated into this ifland.
And hence he in- 
fers, that, indead of deriving druid from either or the Britilh w T ord derw , an

oak, it clearly comes from the Iridi drui, which, as well as darn in Perfian, lite- 
rally fignines Magnus , or Sapiens.
The derivation from the Greek might feem natural to thofe who underdood 
Greek, and did not underdand Celtic.
But the druids were fo called, probably, 
before the Greek language was formed: the fad:, indeed, is, that no fmall part of 
the Greek tongue itfelf is derived from the Celtic.
The Rev. Mr.
Smith, in his Gallic Antiquities, concurs with Major Vallancey in 
deriving druid from druidh, which, in their own language, fignifies wife men: and 
is dill the Gallic term for philofophers, or magicians.
It feems, he fays, to have 
the fame import with the name of the eadern magi, who, like the druids, and many 
other religious feds, united the charaders of the philofopher, the magiftrate, and 
the divine, making each of thefe fervices one and the fame profeffion.
We feem 
not.
then, to fpeak quite at random, when we add, that the wife men from the eaji , 
who fird wordlipped the Saviour of the world, were druids.
According to thefe conjedures, our Long Meg , indead of being a low, vulgar 
corruption of our Cumberland peafantry, as we own we have always fuppofed ic 
was, may, at lead, be the ancient, true and dgnificant name of the arch druid.
Mog is the original Perfian word : this the Chaldeans converted into Mag; of 
which the Greeks and Latins formed their Maguo.
Now, there certainly is no 
great etymological violence, in deriving our Britifh and modern word Meg from 
Mag: the meaning of the adjund, or charaderidical epithet, long , is obvious.
And, in fad, Coi-bhi , or Coibhi- Druidh , w'hich is the Gallic title for the arch-druid, 
is not materially different in fenle from Long-Meg. But the monofyllable Meg , 
or Peg , happening alfo to be our provincial diminutive of the proper name Mar- 
garet, nothing could be more natural or eafy, than for ignorant perfons (when the 
primary and proper fenfe of Mag had, in procefs of time, become obfolete) to 
fancy that it was fynonimous with their vernacular Meg ; and alfo to fancy, that 
all the furrounding Megs , or leffer dones, might pafs for the family, or daughters 
of the great and Long-Meg.
On fo curious and intereding a fubjed, we hope for the indulgence of our 
readers, even if we fhould dwell on it to prolixity.
Mr. Cleland , in his ingenious 
Attempt to relreive the Ancient Celtic , has fuggeded fundry learned and plaufible 
conjectures refpeding druidifm, which cannot fail, we think, to intered every man, 
who has any literary curiofity.
The whole fydem of Heathen mythology, however didorted and difguifed by 
fable, was, he thinks, demondrably derived from the druids.
But the Heathens 
underdood literally what the druids inculcated only allegorically.
It was the 
ereding thofe ideal imperfonations of the druids into real objeds of religious 
wordrip, which, they regarding as a mod impious prophanation, refented : and 
their refentment raifed a religious war, which ended in their extermination.
â€œ When the Romans, by fuperiority of military difeipline, got footing in Bri- 
â€œ tain, they found in druidifm a condant and implacable enemy to their ufurpa- 
â€œ tion.
They would have been glad to introduce their religion; but to that there 
â€œ was an invincible obdacle, in the radical horror and contempt of the natives for 
'â€¢ a religion formed by corruption out of their owm allegories ; which made the

â€œ names of their Heathen gods as familiar to them, as Julius C as far fays they were; 
â€œ but, then, they were fimilar, in a fenfe that muff for ever exclude their being 
Â«* received in a religion that was really divine.
'* Druidifm then, during the Roman ufurpation, lay under every pofliblc dif- 
â€œ couragcment and difgrace: and at length was, if not totally annulled, yet fo 
â€œ greatly weakened, as to give Chrilfianity a fair opening to enter in at its 
ti breaches.
Happily our not unenlightened aboriginal anceffors had no fuch pre- 
judices againff primitive Chrilfianity, as they had fhewn againff Roman 
" Heathenifm.
It is capable of demonffration, that the cradle of Chrilfianity was 
â€œ on this ifland, and in Gaul.
It was fuperficially from this ifland, that it firft 
ff appeared in fo powerful a flare, as to afford the formation of the beff part of 
â€œ that army, which gave to Conffandne the imperial crown : in return for which.
** he profeffed Chriffianity, â€” moff probably, at firft, on a political motive.
â€œ It was here then, that, without too much violence to externals at leaf!, Chrifti- 
â€œ anity got footing, fede vacante.
The crofs took place of the May-pole , or holy-rood â€ž 
â€œ in the fairs and market places; with no very material alteration in its form : and the 
â€œ hierarchy was, in fome degree, modelled on thedruidical plan of government.â€ 
It was a vile and infamous flander in the Romans, not unlike that of their call- 
ing all other nations befides their owm, barbarous, to impute to thefe excellent men 
the horrid cuffom of facrificing human vidfims, and innumerable other execrable 
impieties.
â€” " A fond partiality for their own religion, a contempt, as well as ig- 
â€œ norance, of that of the druids, and a fixed averfion to thofe nations among w'hom 
â€œ it prevailed, has evidently mified, in this cafe, the writers of Greece and Rome.â€ 
In deferibing druidifm, they feem, not feldom, to have fcledted fome of the dis- 
torted features of their own monftrous fyffems; for the religion of the druids 
never was utterly unlovely, till it became polluted and defiled by having incorpora- 
ted in it, fome ot the impurities of heathenifm.
Let us however now examine 
this Roman accufation calmly; and if the refult fhould be, that we mull, partly at 
lead, allow it to be true, ftill fome of their charges, we perfuade ourfelves, will be 
found to be aggravated.
One of the chief attributes of the Deity, venerated and 
infilled on by the druids, was juflice; the maxims of juftice made great part of their 
precepts, which was natural and proper, as they held a double function, being both 
prtclTs and judges.
â€” Their executions, therefore, were facrifices made to jufiice: 
the devoted w ere criminals guilty of the mod atrocious offences againff: fociety and 
the commons ealth.
The folcmnity and dreadful procefs of this ceremony, would 
imprefs the minds of the fpedtators with the deepdt terror at the execution, and 
greateft abhorrence of the offence; â€” it was at once an adi of religion , and an execu- 
tion of the law .
â€” The holieff ceremonies and offices preceded this grand fpedtacle, 
w hereby the minds of the fpedlators were prepared and infpired w ith that reve- 
rential aw e and veneration, which pious duties raife within the boloms of devotees.
With the utmoft folemnity, the mighty effigies of vindidlive juftice, filled with 
the criminals, the gigantic figure of wicker-work, as it is reprefented by Sammes , 
in his Britannia, which held in its chambers of tribulation, thofe whole guilt ren- 
dered them obnoxious to the world, was exhibited as an horrible fpedtacle to the 
alfembled ftates, and offered as a propitiation for the offences of the people.

no writer pretends even to infinuate, that either priefts or people ever rejoiced in 
the fufferings of the vidlims, 
Upon the whole, after a full consideration and companion of all that has now- 
been quoted, together with all that we have ellew here read, or have feen, we are 
free to give it as our opinion, though with all becoming deference to the opinions 
of the learned authors whole works we have mentioned, that Long-Meg and her 
Daughters , the greateft and mod extraordinary piece of antiquity, we believe in 
the world, of its kind, was folely adopted to offices of law; a court of judica- 
ture ; and place of public afiembly for the difpenfing of juftice, Stonehenge and 
Anbury monuments are of diilerent natures, derived from different periods of time, 
and originally appropriated to different ufes.
Thefe druidical remains, we con- 
ceive, were after the Hebrew mode, rude and unhewn mafTes of done, placed in 
circular order, as an emblem of the eternal cxidence of the Deity.
â€œ And if 
â€œ thou wilt make me an altar of done, thou fhalt not build it of hewn done; for 
if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou had polluted it.

â€” As we 
incline to adopt the rule of the Hebrews for thefe erections, we would farther ob- 
ferve, that in the padage of Jordan they raifed their monuments in number, 
according to the tribes, each tribe a column.
We conceive the number of dones 
in the circle before us denotes the number of delegates, who, from their feveral 
didri&s and tribes, were members of the convention held in this place, a druid to 
-}â€¢ We are free to confefs, we have no where met with an explanation of this remarkable text of ferip- 
ture, that comes quite up to our wifnes.
The opinion of Maimonides is that which commentators in.
general have adopted; and we cannot fuggeft a better.
â€œ ghiia f inquit ) idolatry turn tempos it altaria 
â€œ fua ex lapidibus cafls edificarunt ; ideo inter dixit, its popuii fit ajfimilentur illis.

natural's fua forma mane ant, neeque cxdantur , itfe.â€ 
The idolatrous Heathens ufed to raife their altars to a prodigious height, that their gods might hear 
them..
This ftrange notion, that it was difficult to make their gods hear them, feems to have been a vtiy 
general one among the early Heathen.
In allufion to this idea, Elijah thus mocked the 450 prophets or' 
Baal, when, after calling from morning even until noon , they Prill could not prevail on their idol to hear 
them.
Cry aloud â€ faid Elijah; â€œ for , he is a god: either he is talking , or he is purfiing, or, he is in a 
â€œ journey, â€” or, peradventure he fieepeth, and mujl be awaked,â€ 1 Kings xviii.

There is a (hiking re- 
femblance to this text, in a fragment apud Athenians, lib.vi.
c. 1 5.
The Athenians, in flattery to Deme- 
trius, on his return from Leucas and Corcyra, received him with triumphal Songs, hailing him a; fiotat

ii;w â€” as if he mere the only real god, mhilf others mere 
either fieeping, or gone abroad, or mere no gods.
â€œ It is probable,â€ faith a learned man, (Mr. Arthur Young) â€œ that the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico 
Â«Â« were built for this purpofe, as well as to be for burial-places for their kings.
It is certain, in Mexico 
Â« they were fo; â€” the plain tops to faeviflee on, confirms this: and the ere&ing fuch ftupendous places 
Â« for worihip made it go down better with the people.
God therefore recommended that the Ifraelitesâ€™ 
â€œ altars fliould have no lefembhnce to thofe idolatrous altars, but be made of fods, or unhewn ftones, and 
not with many fteps, as the word may be tranllated, like the pyramids or altars of the Egyptians.â€ 
â€œ It is remarkable, that Plato, in his Book of Laws, xii p, 955, orders that all things belonging to 
Â«Â« the fervice of God Ihould be very fimple and plain, without any coft or ornament: and therefore for- 
â€œ bids gold, filver, or ivory, becaufe they were things too apt to raife envy; and brafs and iron he would 
Â« not have ufed, becaufe they were the inftruments of war: but one fingle piece of wood or ftone was to 
ferve for an altar; and that too fuch an one as could be made in a dayâ€™s time.

each pillar ; diflinguifhing at the fame time how many tribes were amenable to 
this court of judicature.
The druids had other confecrated places for their reli- 
gious duties, high places, the fummits of lofty eminences, (haded with groves of 
oaks; furrounded with feveral fences, encinctures refembling thofe of Sinai, of 
divine defeription.
In their courts of juflice, they began every public adt with 
the previous folemnities of prayer, facrifice, luftration, and other re'igious rites.
If there really ever has been a hollow or bafon on the top of the chief column, cal- 
led Meg, perhaps incenfe was burnt therein, or the facred fire was exhibited, whilfl 
the facrifice was preparing, or the criminals tried before the people.
Such was the 
power of the druids, that they retained the whole legiflative authority.
The prin- 
ciple, that pervaded all their doctrines was this, that all law was from heaven; 
and that, as a divine thing, it folely was the office of the priefis to difpenfe juflice.
The prince, or fovereign, prefided only in war, and at the head of armies : a 
principle and practice alluded to by the poet in the following lines : 
x< Thou art a king, a fovâ€™reign oâ€™er frail men ; 
" 1 am a druid, fervant of the gods; 
â€œ Such fervice, is above fuch fovâ€™reignty.â€ 
Where, by-the-by, however, w 7 e may be permitted to obferve, that, in ufing the 
term gods, this learned and elegant writer, is certainly inaccurate.
It no where 
appears, that the druids, at lead, in the earlier periods of their hiffory, were 
Polytheifts.
In confirmation of this opinion, that Long Meg ami her Daughters was a druidi- 
cal court of juflice, as well as a temple for religious worfhip, we will feledt from 
Mr. Clelandâ€™s very extended and diverfified account, a few detached obfervations 
refpedling their ancient modes of tranfadling public bufinefs, and adminiderirg 
juflice.
Long before the foundation of Rome, the government of this country, and of 
Gaul in general, appears to have been veiled in a fupreme magiflrate, aided by 
fundry inferior magiflrates, and popular conventions, or afiemblies, called Mal- 
,ums.
Thefe afiemblies afterwards took the various names of Polk-mo/es, IVard- 
motes, Mallum-mo/es, Par-ley-motes , and Wittenage -moles.
Of all figures, the druids mod afiedted the circular.
Their cir, birs, fJsires, 
churches, all took their appellation and form, from the radical bir , or cir, a circle.
Church, or kirk, comes from kir-rock , the circle of flones : by contraction, it is kirk, 
and by corruption, church.
A kirk, church, or place of worfhip, in druid ical times, 
was literally no more than a circle of ftones.
It is not in this word alone, that 
we of the north have preferved the true pronunciation ; w hilfl our more refined 
neighbours of the fouth have been the corrupters of our language.
Thefe flones, 
circularly placed, had always an high jlone for the feat of the prefident, or head- 
judge.
It was called, fometimes, the /landing Jlone , and always the jlone 0/ power.
This Hone generally flood fingle ; thereby ferving, occafionally, for the altar, or 
high Jlone of facrifice.
Juflice was adminiflered on the fpot, by the prefiding druid, fub Dio, within 
the circle, or ray â€¢ which therefore was equivalent to our bar.
From this word ray , 
K k 2 may 
DRUIDâ€™s MONUMENT.
[Leath Ward, 
o C2 
may be derived Rhea , the goddefs of juftice, reus> the party accufed ; and perhaps 
religion.
From this ray it was deemed the higheft of all crimes to efcape, or to 
tranfgrefs it, till delivered by juftice; and henc t i fuperJlilion i or continuing thus to 
lfand in one fpot, till duly difcharged, was, at firft, a ferious and facred word ; but, 
in procefs of time, through abufe, became a term of reproach.
Religion , even as 
it appears in Latin, is almoft literally, the being bound, by the ray.
In this inflitution we have the moll; probable origin of the magic circle ; of which 
fome traces areto be found in almoft all countries.
The magicianâ€™s wand was nothing 
but the bough, by which the party arraigned (at-ray-in) was arrejled , (at-ray-ejk) 
Of this cuftom we have fome remains to this day, in the conftableâ€™s ftaffi, and 
fberiffâ€™s wand.* Herealfo occurs perhaps the true reafon, why jurymen, being 
once charged with the prifoner, could not depart, till they had acquitted or con- 
demned him.
The trial being in the open air, and the culprit being under no 
confinement but of the JuperJUtion of the ray , or circle of juftice, by which he was 
ray-ligioujly bound, that bond might feem to be diffolved, when his jury had taken 
cognizance of his cafe.
Their departure then muft have been conftdered as a ter- 
mination of procedure ; and the prifoner, ipfo fafto, at liberty : thence the necdlity 
of immediate decifion.
The great merit of King Alfred was, not his creating, but reftoring the ancient 
laws of Britain ; under fuch neceftary modifications, as the change of circumftances 
and religion required.
There is in general great injuftice done to thofe times which 
preceded the Roman invafion ; which we are ftill fo fervile and abjecftas to fpeak 
of, though merely on Roman authority, as barbarous.
The Romans corrupted, 
but did not civilize our ifland ; and fubftituted laws far from preferable to 
thofe which they abrogated.
What volumes have not been written on the feudal 
tenures, while hardly anything is faid of the allodial ones, which were the laws of 
druidifm, and to which our anceftors returned with eagernefs the moment it was 
in their power ?
The hiftory of an ancient Rritifh Iegiflnti ve aflembly, and aftizes, not only gives 
us a clearer view of the plan and purpofes of Long-Meg and her Daughters ; but 
fhews us alfo the true defign of all fimilar druidical remains, either in our own 
country, or elfewhere.
In the parifnes of Edenhall and Lazonby there are yet fome 
confiderable remains of ftones, though many of them have been carried away, 
and all of them are thrown out of their ancient form and order, which ftill go by 
the name of raifes.
The names alone of thefe places fhevv what they were â€” 
The fame may be laid of Stone-raifc , in the parilfi of Weftvvard ; and perhaps of 
Standing-Jlone, in Wigton parilfi.
Dun-matl-raife is ftill more exprefiive, and ob- 
vious: though on no name whatever have etymologifts made fuch egregious and 
palpable miftakes.
The whole country, or kingdom, feems to have been parcelled out into fmall 
diftriefts, fomething analogous to our wards, hundreds or {hires ; in each of which 
there was a mole, or court of juftice, fubordinate to the great ones.
Thefe courts 
* The verge of the couit is a term ftill in acceptation in the law.
â€” It in fome cafes applies to the 
confines or limits of privileges, and in others to the verge or wand of the bailiff of a cuftomary court, 
under which the tenant performs his homage and fealty, and takes his admittance.

â€¢were held in fome lefler circles of fiones, generally on the furnmit of an hill, 
thence called the mote-hill.
It is extraordinary, that fuch an hill, ftill retaining 
its primitive name, fubftfts to this day in our country; ftill uncultivated, and but 
little altered from what we may fuppofe it to have been in the primeval days, of 
which we are fpea king.
We mean the {mail, but not unfightly, mountain, near 
Cockermouth, called Mnta , or Moota : on the pinnacle of which is one (lone, of a 
confiderable fixe, called Muta or Moota Man. This is all that is left of its ancient 
ray-ltgious circle and ftone of power.
The hall in which the aftizes are held at 
Carlille,* ftill goes by the name of the mote, or moot-hall.
Nothing can poftibly be 
farther from the lcnfe, than the idea of its being a mute-hall ; as we have fometimes 
fecn it Ipel led .
Our common expreflion of mooting a point , frill in ufe in our mo- 
dern courts of law, is evidently derived from thefe old motes of our remote 
anceftors.
Dun-mail-raife contains the whole hiftory of thefe motes in its name.
Nothing 
can be more puerile, than the notion that it was fo called, merely from a raijed 
heap of ftones ; and from fome imaginary King of Cumberland, whom Jeffery of 
Monmouth, the firft fabricator, we believe, of this idle fable, calls D unmail.
Of 
a noble race â€˜was Shenkin.
We have already obferved, that a general meeting of the whole nation, or of all 
the inhabitants of a diftricft, convened to deliberate on the public affairs, and to pafs 
laws, was called a mallnm , mallum-mote.
The town of Maltnjbury, and perhaps our 
own Melmerby too, is literally an hill , in which one of thefe mallum-moles was held.
Every (hire, every municipal town in Britain, whenever a town or circular 
ftaccade came to have a political incorpoiation, had its mallum.
In thefe mallum- 
violes , or parley-motes , every arreft, or a eft, that was paffed was called dun-tvallo , 
which literally imports the will done, or enabled ; a phrafe exactly equivalent to 
our act of parliament.
f Hence Dun-walloght , in the parifti of Cumrevv ; hence 
Dun-mallard, an hill near Cllfwaier; and hence too Dun-mail -raije.
in the parifti of Addingham are-three feveral manors; Glaffonby\ and Gameljby% 
were anciently united, and bounded to the weft by the rivulet that falleth from the 
eaftern mountains through the park of Kirkofwald ; and to the eaft by an exten- 
five tract of mountainous land in Aldfton Moor.
One Hildred held the above- 
mentioned manors by the grant of King Henry I.
under two {hillings cornage ; 
his great grand-daughter, King John gave in marriage to William de Ireby ; he 
had two coheireffes, one of whom poffefted thefe manors, and married Lafcelles 
of Bolton, whofe daughter married Thomas Seaton, and their iftue, Chriftopher, 
forfeited by being a partizan with Robert Bruce and the Scots, in the reign of 
King Edward I.

Thefe pofleffions were given by the crown ro William Latimer, who was great 
grandfather of Elizabeth, wife of John Neville, father of Ralph Neville, Earl of 
Weftmorland.
He gave his eftates in Cumberland to his fecond fon, George 
Lord Latimer, whofe daughter and heirefs married John Lord Neville, of Raby.
In the reign of King Henry VlIL four coheirelfes were feized of thefe manors, 
from whom they palled to the Dacres, fo to the Fines, then to Leonard, Earl of

The third is the manor of Little Salkeld* given in 1292, to the prior and con-

THE MOUNTAIN CROSS-FELL.
The following Defer iption of the Mountain of Crofs-Fell, was publifhed in the Gentleman's 
Magazine for 1747, p .
384.
â€œ A mountain that is generally ten months buried in fnow, and eleven in clouds, 
" cannot fail exciting the attention and curiofity of a traveller.
That immenfe ridge of mountains, which are reputed the Britiffi Alps, f make 
" their firfi appearance in Derbyfiiire, and are thence continued in one chain of 
â€œ different elevations to the river Tweed : the Lancaffiire and Copeland heights, 
â€œ with thofe in Yorkfhire and Durham, being only detached parts of this great 
â€œ body; fuch as are remarkably eminent have particular names affigned them, 
â€œ whilfi the general ridge bears one appellation for feveral miles together.
â€œ Crofs-Fel!
y though difiinguifhed in none of the country maps, is moft Angularly 
,f eminent, whether you regard its height, or the immenfe bafe it Bands upon, 
,f being above twenty miles in circumference: in fome parts the rife is very 
â€œ leilurely and gradual, in others more rugged and perpendicular, emitting 
â€œ Breams to both feas.* The infcnfible afeent removes its top to a very great dif- 
" tance from the inhabited plains; and being in a manner encompafled with other 
" defolate and barren mountains, it retains the fnow much longer than any we can 
" fee in Britain; there being fome who affirm, that it has continued fome times 
** for (even w hole years together.
" AldBon is the neared: town, where one can get a fafe condudtor, to crofs 
â€œ thefe almoB impervious wades ; â€” a country extremely ill reprelented in all our 
Â«* maps, yet published, not to mention their exhibiting the town on the wrong 
" fide of the river Nint.
About two in the afternoon we fet forward, three in 
â€œ company, and two who joined us afterwards, out of the fame curiofity.
We 
palfed the river Tyne near its confluence wâ€™ith Blackburn, beyond which, this 
* f immenfe wafte begins, and could plainly perceive the alteration of the air in 
â€œ riding a few miles.
On the top of Rodcrick-heights is a pretty large lake, called 
f * Grcen-cajlle-locb ,Â§ which receives no vifible feeder, but emits a fmall Bream 
a large encampment ; and upon a rock in the quarry, was an infeription left there by the 20th legion, 
Ailed Valeris Viclrix .
â€” This infeription, by working of the quarry, has lately been cut away, and part of 
it is now over the door of a cowhcufe belonging to Thomas Atkinfon, of Milburn, in Wettmorland, â€” 
What remains on the Hone over the door, is 
â€¢jm] 
+ Called the Apennines, by other writers.
* The great rivers Wear, Tees, and Tyne, all iffue from the bafe of this mountain: the ftreams which 
flow to the weft are but fmall brooks.
Â§ A name derived from an ancient femicircular fortification of earth, near its margin.

â€œ northward to the- faid burn ; nor is there any veftige of a caftle, from which it 
â€œ could be prefumed to borrow the name.
The Swallows ,\ J thole inconteftible 
â€œ remains of Noahâ€™s deluge, begin here to be \ery frequent; fome of thefe are 
ff thirty or forty yards in diameter, and near as much deep, perfectly circular, but 
â€œ contain no water at any feafon, the ground having gradually fallen in at the 
u finking of the waters; but where they have happened amid rocks, the holes are 
â€œ left open to incredible depths.
This naturally accounts for thofe furprifing 
" phenomena in the Pyrenean and Narbonne mountains; and our Elden- Hole, in 
<c Derby fhire, whofe depths have never been afeertained with the longeft lines.
" On the defeent of Roderick-Fell there is plenty of herbage, but few plants, 
â€œ fave the fcorpiodes, arvenfis, and tormentil.
â€œ At the bottom of this height, Blackburn divides itfelf into two branches, the 
â€œ eaftermoft tumbling over a precipice of forty * perpendicular yards, w r hich makes 
<f a molt wild, furprifing cafcade, 
â€œ From this rivulet we are to account the rife of Crofs-Fell.
We are now fo 
â€œ much environed with large and extended moraffes, rocks, and mountains, that 
t( they exhibit a very frightful appearance; not the veftige of a houfe, except fome 
,f old Jhiehy where, in former ages, the people had reforted, like the Afiatic Tar- 
fC tars, to graze their cattle in fummer, â€” a pra<ftice now quite difufed.
There 
â€œ were a few fheep, but no deerf that we could fee, though there are feveral on 
f< the heights: and notwithftanding the extraordinary drought, the water followed 
â€œ our horfes foot-fteps for miles together, except where the ground was rot- 
â€œ ten.
At the place called Butmanâ€™s Cleugh,Â§ there have been formerly lead 
â€œ works, now left: off.
We had now afeended gradually about three miles, 
ff through very broken morafiy waftes, when the mountain began to rife in 
" three very formidable afeents, very ftcep, in the manner of mount Lebanon, 
,c piled one above another, with large and extenftve plains to each of them, and 
<c ioofe fhivery ftones on brows, very troublefome to the horfes, which we now 
â€œ were obliged fometimes to quit.
This continued for two miles more, when we 
" got on the edge of the higheft which forms a capacious plain of feveral hun- 
â€œ dred acres, if you reckon from the eaft afeent ; but of fuch a barren foil, that 
<c there was not fo much as a lingie leaf of grafs, herb or plant to be found in fo 
,l large a plain, exclufive of a few of thofe rings attributed to fairies, fome of which 
â€œ are perfect circles of the gramen glumis variis, in botany, aferibed by Linnaeus, 
â€œ in his Defcription of the Baltic Ifles, to a particular quality of its affe&ing the 
â€œ dirtieft foil, where no grafs can thrive.
This immenfe plain has no other verdure, 
" therefore, but a venerable afpeeft from the mofs or down, and this can hardly 
â€œ draw a fubftftance to lupport itfelf; fo inconceivably barren is this diftinguilhed 
â€œ eminence.
The weft fide, towards the Cumberland plains, is more rocky and 
â€œ fteep than the way we afeended.
Great part of fix counties were to be feen, 
â€œ and notwithftanding our height, there feemed to be four or five, mountains that

Â« difputed pre-eminence, the reft looked all far below us : thefe were Skiddaw, in 
â€œ the weft of Cumberland, Creffell, in Scotland, Pennvgent and Ingleborow, iti 
Â«* Yorkftiire, and the higheft Cheviot in Northumberland.
Â£ I computed the 
diameter of our vilible horizon to exceed one hundred and twenty miles, ftxty 
ct each way from the centre.
The mountains in Cleveland, by the Eaft Sea, were 
â€œ very fair, and the Weft Sea fufficiently difcovcrable.
As to the perpendicular 
u height of the mountain, I could not fo well judge, having no barometer, and 
â€œ the top buffers too much by refradlion to be afeertained by geometrical 
** principles.
â€œ Whether it takes its name of Crofs-fell from its tranfverfe fttuation, to the 
â€œ common run of that ridge, or from a crofs ere&ed, as report fays, to diflodge 
<f the aerial demons, which were thought to poffefs that defolate mountain, I do 
â€œ not take upon me to determine.
â€œ P.
S. Being the 14th of Auguft, and a long drought, and hot feafon, we were 
f< not able to find any the leaf!: relicks of fnow, in places moft likely for it ; which 
ft is very extraordinary.â€ 
To this well-written and pleafing defeription, we fubjoin what our correfpon- 
dents and our own obfervation afford on the fubjecl.
The Rev. William Richardfon (for whofe abundant and accurate information, 
through the whole of this parifh, we cannot fufficiently exprefs our obligations) 
obferves, that the afeent to Crofs-fell is not near fo difficult as is here reprefented, 
to thofe who know the fells.
Snow has never laid a whole year upon it, within the 
laft feventy years, as I have been well allured by the fhepherds, who frequently, 
and at all feafons, traverfe thefe high hills.
The very fummit is covered with mofs 
of various kinds, viz.
hypnum, bryum, and innium.
The aira montana, mountain 
hair grabs ; nardus ftridlus, heath matgrafs; feftuca ovina, fheepâ€™s fefeue, and 
rumex digynus, mountain dock are intermixed with the mofs.
Amongft the 
ftones, are oxalis acetofella, cuckow-bread ; and urtica dioica, common nettle.
â€” 
The fummit is a large heap only of loofe whitifh freeftone, and (lightly covered 
with thefe and other vegetables.
He fays, the fummit of Crofs-fell is in latitude 54Â°-42'-05" north ; its elevation 
from the middle part of Lazonby bridge near Kirkofwald, is 910 or 912 yards, 
and allow ing fix yards more for the height of the bridge over the river Eden, it 
will be about 918 yards; and if you allow 80 yards for the fall of the river Eden 
into Solway Frith, the hill will even then be fcarcely 1000 above the level of the 
fea : its diftance from Kirkofwald is eleven miles, and 1040 yards.

THE MOUNTAIN CROSS-FELL.
[Lsatii Ward 
below the fummit of the hill, is nearly the fame in February and in July, viz.
be- 
tween 35Â° and 36Â°.
Fie adds, the mod delightful fight; the mod noble fpecdacle I ever faw, was 
the fun rifing, when I was on the fummit of Crofs-fell on the 1 Sth day of June; 
it is infinitely grander than a fetting fun.
The helm-windy which has before been mentioned, and which frequently affeds 
this trad of mountains, nearly forty miles in extent, is now to be conddered.
Thefe 
heights are fuppoled to affed the weather, in a manner fomewhat fimilar to what 
the inhabitants of the Malabar and Coromandel coads experience; and what are 
called in this country Jhedding-winds, generally blow on the contrary tides of Crofs- 
fell, from oppofite quarters to the helm-%mnds ; and the dorms which rake the 
country on one dde of the mountain, feldom affed the other.
Upon the fummirs 
of this lofty ridge of mountains there frequently hangs a vad volume of clouds, in 
a fullen and drowfy date, having little movement; this heavy colledion of va- 
pours often extends feveral miles in length, and dips itfelf from the fummit, half 
â– way down to the bafe of thofe eminences; and frequently, at the fame time, the 
other mountains in view are clear of mid, and Ihew no figns of rain.
This 
helm, or cloud, exhibits an awful and folemn appearance, tinged with white 
by the funâ€™s rays that drike the upper parts, and fpreads a gloom below, over the 
inferior parts of the mountains, like the diadows of night.
When this colledion 
of vapour fird begins to gather upon the hills, there is to be obferved hanging 
about it, a black drip of cloud, continually Hying off, and fed from the white 
part, which is the real helm ; this drip is called the helm-bar, as, during its appear- 
ance, the winds are thought to be redded by it; for, on its difperdon, they rage 
vehemently upon the vallies beneath.
The diredion of the helm-bar is parallel to 
that part of the main cloud or colledion of vapour, that is tinged with white 
by being druck with the funâ€™s rays; the bar appears in continual agitation, as 
boiling, or druggling with contrary blads ; whild the helm all this time keeps a 
motionlefs dation.
When the bar is difperfed, the winds that iffue from the helm 
are fometimes extremely violent ; but that force feems to be in proportion to the 
real current of the winds which blow at a didance from the mountains, and which 
are frequently in a contrary diredion, and then the helm-wind does not extend 
above two or three miles; without thefe impediments it feldom fweeps over a 
larger track than twelve miles, perhaps from the mere reddance of the low-er at- 
mofphere.
It is remarkable, that at the bafe of the mountain the blads are much 
Ids violent than in the middle region ; and yet the hurricane is fometimes impe- 
tuous even there, bearing every thing before it, when at the didance of a few miles 
there is a dead calm, and a funny fky.
The fpring is mod favourable to this 
phaenomenon, the helm-wind will fometimes blow for a fortnight, till the air in the 
lower regions, warmed before by the induence of the fun, is thereby rendered 
piercing cold.
Mr. Ritfon, that extraordinary genius, of whom we have given fome account, in 
its proper place, who wrote the Introdudion to Clarkeâ€™s Survey of the Lakes, 
thus fpeaks of this helm-wind ; â€” " The helm-wind is generated in that enormous 
<f cloud, which, like a helmet, covers the fummit of Crofs-fell.
It is there particu- 
ft larly favoured by circumdances ; for on one fide there is a plain of about thirty 
â€œ miles in breath, in fome places, and on the other no hills to rival that from 
" whence 
Leath Ward.} THE MOUNTAIN CROSS-FELL.

44 whence it comes.
This wind is not much taken notice of in natural hiftory ; 
44 yet the Dutch, by the iron chains with which they are obliged to moor their 
44 fhips at the Cape of Good-Hope, bear ample teftimony to the fury of fuch a 
44 one.
It hath been met with by the late voyagers in the fouth-feas ; it is laid to 
â€œ have been felt in the Straits of Gibraltar; and I doubt not but mariners and 
44 travellers have found it in many other places, though they may not have obfer- 
â€œ ved it with care, or may have given it different names.â€ 
Mr. Richardfon remarks, â€œ That in the vicinity of thefe mountains the air is 
44 generally very clear and healthy, owing perhaps to the violent helm-winds in the 
44 months of December, January, February, March, and April, but the inhabitants 
â€œ of the countries immediately influenced by that wind are more fubjeeft to rheu- 
matte complaints, than thofe at a greater diftance.
The fummitof Crofs-fell, and 
44 the regions a little lower, are fometimes clear, when the vale is covered with a 
44 fog ; I have been upon the mountain when that has happened, and the fpedacle 
44 is curious, as the clouds appear firm, though uneven, like a boiflerous diffurbed 
M ocean.
All diffant founds are at that rime heard diffindly, and ftrike the ear in 
â€œ a very Angular manner, as they feem to ifiue from under your feet.
As to the 
44 he/m, the cloud does not alw ays reft on the tops of the hills, but is fometimes feve- 
44 ral degrees higher, and does not always preferve a regular form; neither is there 
44 always a helm-bar, for that phaenomenon only appears, when the wind, at a little 
44 diftance, blows from the weft.
1 have fometimes obferved four or five of thefe 
44 helm-bars , within five miles of the hills, and then the wind blew irregularly, 
44 fometimes from the eaft, and fometimes from the weft.
It appears to me to be 
44 the fame kind of phaenomenon as that at the Cape of Good-Hope, deferibed by 
44 Sparman.
When the fnow appears upon the hills, the winds then blow with 
44 great violence.
Swinburn, I think, mentions fomething fimilar in Sicily, and 
44 Volney, at Alexandria.
May it not be accounted for by the air being confider- 
44 bly colder on the fummit of thofe hills, than in the country whither it rufhes with 
44 fo much violence?
I have found by a thermometer, that it is I4 0 colder on the 
44 top of Crofs-fell than at the bottom, indeed I did not prove that once, but three 
" or four times I found it 12Â°, and frequently ioÂ°.
44 The name of helm feems to be derived from the Saxon, and implies in our lan- 
44 guage, a covering.
Its appearances, according to my remarks, have been that of 
44 a white cloud refting on the fummits of the hills, extending even from Brough 
44 to Brampton ; it w ears a bold broad front, not unlike a vaft float of ice Handing 
44 on edge : on its firft appearance, there ifliies from it a prodigious r.cife, which 
44 in grandeur and aw fulnefs exceeds the roaring of the ocean.
Sometimes there is 
44 a helm-bar , which confifts of a white cloud arranged oppofite to the helm , and 
44 holds a ftation, various in its diftances, fometimes not more than half a mile 
44 from the mountain, at others three cr four miles; fometimes it is in breadth a 
44 quarter of a mile, at others a mile at leaft : this cloud prevents the wind 
44 blowing further weftwaid.
The fky is generally vifible between the helm and 
â€œ the bar, and frequently loofe bodies of vapours or fmall fpecks of clouds are fe- 
44 parated from the helm and the bar, and fl>ing acrofs in oppofite directions, both 
44 eaft and weft, are feen to fweep along the fky with amazing velocity.
When 
44 you arrive at the other fide of the bar- cloud, the wind blows eaft ward, but under- 
44 neath it is a dead calm, 01 gufts of wind from all quarters.

â€œ wind is generally greateft w hen the helm is higheft above the mountains.
The 
â€œ cold air rufhes down the hill with amazing ftrength.fo as to make it very difficult 
â€œ for a perfon to walk againft it; I have frequently been under a neceffity of 
,c turning my back to take breath at every ten yards at leaft; it mofily comes in 
â€œ gulfs, though it fometimes blows with unabated fury for twenty-four hours ; and 
<c continues blowing at intervals for three, four, five, or even fix weeks.

THE PARISH OF EDENHALL.
â€œ T 7 DEN HALL, aula ad rivum Eden , was given to Henry, fon of Swcine, the 
r a fecond brother of Adam.
It Rands on the weft fide of the river, and in 
the foreft of Englewood.
It is now the inheritance of the beft houfe and family 
of the Mufgraves, whofe anceftor, Thomas Mufgrave, had it by the marriage of 
William Stapletonâ€™s fecond daughter and coheir, in the time of King Henry VI, 
and before that, the Stapletons held it from the fir ft year of King Edward III.
for 
five dcfcents.
Jt came to them by the marriage of Julian, one of the two daughters 
and coheirs of Robert Turpe, whofe father, Adam Turpe, was but a child of 
feven years old in King Henry III.
â€™s time, at the death of Robert his father, w ho 
then dried feized thereof.
â€œ Robert Turpe died Henry III.

ter of Robert, and wife of William Stapleton â€” William Stapleton, 36th Edward 
III.
â€” William Stapleton, 3d Richard 11 .
â€” William Stapleton â€” Stapleton â€” Wil- 
liam Stapleton, 1 ith Henry VI.
â€” Joan Stapleton, wife of Thomas Mufgrave, 39th 
Henry Vl,â€t 
The Mufgraves became proprietors here, in the 39th year of the reign of King 
Henry VI.
The manfion-houfe is a handfeme ftone ftru&ure, built in the tafte 
which prevailed about the time of the Charlesâ€™s.
In this houfe are fome good old- 
fafiiioned apartments.
An old painted drinking glafs, called the Luck of Edenhall y 
is preferved with great care.
It is alluded to in the annexed ballad of Duke Whar- 
ton.
In the garden, near to the houfe, is a well of excellent fpring water, called 
Sr. Cuthbertâ€™s well, (the church is dedicated to the faint.) This glafs is fuppofed 
to have been a facred chalice: but the legendary tale is, that the butler, going to 
draw water, furprifed a company of fairies who were amufing themfelves upon 
the green, near the well : he feized the glafs, which w'as ftanding upon its margin 5.
they tried to recover it ; but, after an inefretftual ftruggle, flew away, faying, 
If that glafs either break or fall, 
Farcwel the luck of Edenhall.
This family is of great antiquity and reputation, and came into England with 
the conqueror, and fettled at Mufgrave, in Weftmorland.
We adopt, however the etymology of the name, as given by our predeceflors ; 
with fuch additional obfervations of our own, as cur more extended refearches enable 
us to fuggeft.
Mufgrave , like molt other names, was, no doubt, originally a name 
of office.
Grave , or graff] is the Teutonic, or German title, of a prasfedt, keeper, 
or governor.
Thus burg-graff, plas-grajj \ land-grajf \ and margraff, denote refpec- 
tively, the fuperintendant of the city, palace, land, marches, or boundaries.
We 
have foftened the word down into reeve, in our own Jloire-reeve , or Jberiff.
Graff, 
or grave, appears to us not to be derived, as lexicographers in general, and even 
Ly-e* 
f. Dtnlonâ€™s MS.
270 
PARISH OF EDENHALL.
[Leath Ward.
Lye, imagine, from the Saxon geref exigere , rapere , but from the Teutonic grou, 
which implies hoary , venerable: and hence the title feems to be fomething like fe- 
nator.
Neither is Mufgrave equivalent to Margrave : nor yet, in our opinion, is 
it derived from the Greek, M Vsm> from which Hefychius derives our Englifh word 
mufing.
Its obvious derivation, we think, is from the old Saxon word maiew , now 
fpelled mew ; which originally denoted the place in which the hawks were kept, 
and now denotes ftables, perhaps, for no better reafon than that the kingâ€™s {tables 
near charing Crofs are built on the iite of the ancient Mews.
Hence Mews-grave , 
or Mu/grave, is clearly the keeper of the hawks ; or, perhaps, the kingâ€™s equerry , or 
majler of the horfe 
In the reign of King Edward III.
they became purchafers of Hartley Cattle, 
where they chiefly refided, till Edenhall came into the family, in Henry VI.
â€™s time, 
by a marriage with Joan, one of the eoheirettes of Sir William de Stapleton, of 
Edenhall, Knight; fince which it has been the principal feat of the Mufgrave 
family, until Sir Philip, the prefent baronet, removed to Kempton Park, in Mid- 
dlefex, a fine efiate preferred to him by his maternal uncle, the late Sir John 
Chardin, Bart, in 1746.
Every part of the river Eden, which we vifited, is pictturefque and beautiful; 
pretty lawns and meadows, and here and there fine hanging groves are difperfed 
on its banks ; whilft the borders of the channel are beautified with rocks, and 
the ttream flows in meanders cr cafcades.
The church of Edenhall was given by King Edward I.
to the priory and con- 
vent of Carlifle, and foon after they obtained its appropriation.* 
In 
* This parilh, in the year 1750, confided of 26 houfes ; in 1781, of 23, which contained 167 inha- 
bitants.
From a calculation made of the deaths, on an average of ten years, viz.
from 1771 to 1780,, 
ieclufive, it appears, that or.e in about 55 of all the inhabitants of this parilh dies annually.

There were lands in this parilh belonging to the abbey of Holme-Cultram, 
which, after the diffolution, were granted to Thomas Lord Wharton.
On the fell 
immediately adjoining to Edenhall plantations, are evident remains of buildings, 
and fences to a confiderable extent, as alfo traces of the plough, on many partsÂ°of 
the common.
When the plague raged in the north in 1598, it attacked this parifh, and there 
died forty-fix perfons, as appears by the regilter; being computed about a fourth 
part of the inhabitants.
The people, during the contagion, left their dwelling- 
houfes, and built themfelves fneds and hovels on the commons, and other airy and 
retired fituations ; and the pariihioners of Edenhall, who died of that difeafe, 
were buried near their lodges on Penrith fell.

In Sir William Dugdaleâ€™s pedigree of this family, I find Thomas Mufgrave, chevalier, Ao. 31ft Edw. III.
but prefuming 
him to be the fame with this Thomas Lord Mufgrave, 1 have omitted him.
Ao. 28th Edw. III.
Joan, wife of Richard de Mufgrave, held Crofby Gerard, Soulby and Little Mufgrave.
Sir Thomas Mufgrave was a knight, Ao. 2d of Richard II.
in his fatherâ€™s lifetime.
Hartley or Harcla Caftle, in 
Weftmorland, belonged anciently to a family of the fame name, until Sir Andrew de Harcla, (who was fummoned as 
baron to the parliament, Ao. 13th Edw. II.
and was that year created Earl of Carlifle) forfeited the fame for high 
treafor.; he being, Ao. 16th Edw. II.
at Carlifle, tried, found guilty, degraded, and executed for the fame!
I have heard 
that Hartley came, by attainder of Sir Andrew aforefaid, unto Richard II.
who granted it unto Nevill, of Raby, 
(or Scroop, of Bolton) who conveyed it to this Sir Thomas Mufgrave.
This Sir Thomas Mufgrave, and the prior of

The following songs are not tranfcribed for their tranfcendent merit; though 
they certainly have fome.
We feled them, becaufe they are local, and belong to 
Cumberland; and we are not fure, that an account of Edenhall, and the Muf- 
graves, could be deemed complete, if they were not given.
That by Duke 
Wharton, though not quite a burlefque, is a humorous parody on the celebrated 
fong of Chevy-Chafe.
Of the author of the others, we are ignorant.
John 
Armftrong was the Robin- Hood of the borders.
Some remains of his caftle of 
Gill-Knockie are ftill to be feen on the eftate of the Duke of Buccleugh, in Liddef- 
dale: and there is a remarkable faftnefs adjoining to it, called Armfirongâ€™ s Strong- 
hold, faid to be uncommonly curious.
â€œ Johnny Arntftrongâ€™s Laft good Night, fhewing how John Armftrong, with 
" his eighticore men, fought a bloody battle with the Scotch king, at Edinburgh.â€ 
* Of the hero of the following ballad, all his neighbours, even the neareft Eng- 
Â« lifh ftood in awe, and paid him tribute.
When James V.
reigned in Scotland, 
4 and Henry VIII.
in England, the former, willing to fupprefs all robbers, levied 
* a fmall army, marched out againft the banditti, and pitched his tents hard by 
4 the river Ewfe.
At this John Armftrong became fenfible of his danger, and 
* w ould willingly have made his peace.
Some of the kingâ€™s officers, finding him 
* in this difpolition, fecretly perfuaded him to make his fubmiffion; adding, that 
* they durft allure him he would be kindly received.
Armftrong followed their 
* counfel, and with fixty horfemen unarmed, haftened to the king, but imprudently 
* forgot to provide himfelf with palles and a fafe-condu(ft.
Thofe who had given 
4 him this advice, informed of his error, lay in ambufh for, lurprifed and took him, 
* with his fixty men; and carried them all to the king, pretending that they had 
* made them prifoners.
Armfirong was accufed not only of being a free-booter, 
* but was alfo charged with a defign of delivering up that part of the country to 
* the Englilh; and being condemned, he, with fifty-four of his companions, (molt 
* probably a majority of them Armfirongs) was hanged ; the other fix were refer- 
* ved as hofiages, to deter their fellows from again falling into fuch a lawlefs courfe 
* of living.
Our poet poffibly thought that the Gallows was to ignominious a 
* death for his hero; and therefore rather chofe to let him die fighting bravely.
â€” 
4 Inftead of threefcore, he gives him a retinue of eightfeore men, and lays the feene 
4 in Edinburgh: but thefe are the only material points in which he differs from 
4 the real hiftory.â€™ 
We have only farther to obferve, that, in the borders, above any other parts of 
the county, or perhaps of the kingdom, particular names and families have always 
prevailed.
A majority of the people, on both fides of the Line that divides the two 
kingdoms, always have been and ftill are, either Grahams, Bells, or Armfirongs.* 
The laft, once a powerful tribe, are ftill numerous, but no longer, in other refpeefts, 
of great eminence.
The celebrated Dr. Armftrong was one of them.
And fo was 
that once celebrated perfonage, Archy Armfirong , jefter to King James and King 
Charles I, and often mentioned in the annals of thofe times.
He was born in the 
* The Armfirongs are laid to have teen originally Danifh: though Fortinlras , which the Saxon de- 
fendants of the tribe that migrated hither properly tranflated Armfirong , may feem to be Norman, rather

parifh of Arthuret ; and though it was his lot to live but little in his native 
parifh, he had the felicity to draw his lad breath, where his fird was drawn ; and 
to be buried in Arthuret church.
As there was fomething eccentric, or at 
lead extraordinary in the fortunes and fates of perfons bearing this name, it was 
the lot of this gentleman (for a gentleman he probably was/though called a fool) 
alfo to incur the difpleafure of the court and to be banifhed.
The occadon of 
this fevere fentence, we are told, was no more than perhaps an ill-timed jed (as 
jeds are apt to be!
on Archbifhop Laud.
When news came to London, that the 
Scots were all in an uproar about the liturgy, which Laud was fo defirous of intro- 
ducing among them, Armdrong met the archbifhop as he was hadening to court, 
and iignificantly afked him, Who's fool now ?
The effect of this farcafm we find 
in the records of the council book.
â€” <c Ordered, that Archibald Armdrong, the 
<c kingâ€™s fool, be banilhed the court for fpeaking difrefpectful words of the Lord

1. Is there ever a man in all Scotland, 
From the higheft edate to the lowed degree, 
That can (hew himfeif before our kin?, 
Scotland is fo full of treachery ?
2. Yes, there is a man in Cumberland, 
And Johnny Armdrong they do him call; 
He has no lands nor rents coming in, 
Yet he keeps eightfeore men within his hall.
3. He has horfes and harnefs for them all, 
And goodly deeds that be milk white.
With their goodly belts about their necks, 
With hats and feathers all alike.
X 
4..
The king he writes a loving letter, 
And with his own hand fo tenderly, 
And hath fent it unto Johnny Armdrong, 
To come and fpeak with him fpeedily.
5. When John he lookâ€™d this letter upon, 
He lookâ€™d as blithe as a bird in a tree; 
I was never before a king in my life, 
My father, my grandfather, nor none of us three, i 
6. But feeing we mud go before the king, 
Lord, we will go mod gallantly ; 
Ye fiiall every one have a velvet coat, 
Laid down with golden laces three.
7. And every one (hall have a fcarlet cloak, 
Laid down with fdver laces five; 
With your golden belts about your necks, 
A nd hats and feathers all alike.
S. But when Johnny went from Gilt-knock-YLsW

Now, fare thee well, thou Gilt-knockYldW, C 
I fear, I fhall never fee thee again !

With their bucklers and fwords hanging to their \ 
knee.

But when John came the king before, 
v With his eightfeore men fo gallant to fee,

Ke thought he had been a king, as well as he,

O pardon, pardon, my fovr reign liege, 
Pardon for my ei; hticore men and me; 
For my name it is johnny Armdrong, 
And a fubjecl of yours, my liege, faid he.
12.
Away with thee, thou faife traytor, 
No pardon I will grant to thee; 
But to-morrow morning, by eight of the clock, 
I will hang up thy eightfeore men and thee.
13.
Then Johnny lookâ€™d over his left fhoulder, 
And to his merry men thus faid he; 
I have afked grace of a gracelefs face.
No pardon there is for you or me.
X 14.
Then Johnny pullâ€™d out his good bread fwoid, 
That was made of the metal fo free; 
Had not the king movâ€™d his foot as he did, 
John had taken his head from his fair body.
15.
Come, follow me my merry men all, 
We will fcorn one foot for to fly; 
X It never fhall be faid, we were hangâ€™d like dogs, 
A We will fight it out mod manfully.

Then they fought on, like champions bold,

X Till they had killâ€™d all the kingâ€™s good guard.
There were none left alive, but one, two, or

But then rofe up all Edinburgh, 
They rofe up by thoufands three, 
A cowardly Scot came John behind, 
And run him through the fair body.

I will lay me down, and bleed a while.
Then Iâ€™ll rife and fight again.

It is evident, from the whole tenor of this 
ballad, that Gilt-knock-Hall, though under the jurif- 
didtion of the Scottifh king, was then confidered as 
a part of our county, and of courfe, Armftrong was 
deemed a Cumberland man.
" A pleafant Ballad, fhewing how two valiant knights.
Sir John Armftrong 
** and Sir Michael Mufgrave fell in love with the beautiful daughter of Lady 
M Dacres, in the north; and of the great firife that happened between them for 
*â€¢ her, and how they wrought the death of one hundred men.
Whether this ballad be the production of the fame poet, as that of Armftrongâ€™s 
Death, we know not: but we are inclined to believe, it is the fame Armftrong.
In this fong, however, he is knighted ; and, in diredt oppofition to the former 
ltory, killed in fingle combat by his rival.
Poets are feldom accurate hiftorians.
Neither among the Mufgraves, of Mufgrave, thofe of Edenhall, or Hayton, do 
we find a Michael : Chriftopher feems to have been their favourite Chriftian 
name, The title of Sir , how'ever in thefe ages, does not always imply knighthood > 
having frequently been given even to the clergy; as Sir Hugh Evans , in Shake- 
fpear: the tw o heroes of our ballad then may have been entitled.
Sir , by the poet, 
merely to do them honour; though, we obferve, he does, in his verfes frequently, 
call them Knights.
1. As it fell out one Whitfunday, 
The blithe time of the year, 
When every tree was clad with green, 
And pretty birds fing clear: 
The lady Dacres took her way 
Unto the church that pleafant day, 
With her fair daughter, freflr and gay, 
A bright and bonny lafs.
2. Sir Michael Mufgrave in like fort 
To church repaired then.
And fo did Sir John A.rmftrong too, 
With all his merry men: 
Two greater friends there could not be, 
Nor braver knights for chivalry.
Both bachelors of high degree, 
Fit for a bonny lafs .
X 3.
They fat them down upon one feat 
Like loving brethren dear, 
y With hearts and minds devoutly bent 
Godâ€™s fervice for to hear.
j But, rifing from their prayers thoâ€™ 
0 Their eyes a ranging ftrait did go, 
X Which wrought their utter overthrow, 
0 All for one bonny lafs.

Quoth Mufgrave unto Armftrong then

5. I fwear, faid Mufgrave, by this fword 
Which did my knighthood win.
To fteal away fo fweet a dame 
Could be no ghoflly fin.
That deed, quoth Armftrong, would be ill, 
Except you had her right good will, 
That your defire flie would fulfil, 
And be thy bonny lafs.
6. By this the fervice quite was done 
And home the people paft ; 
They wifiied a blitter 011 his tongue, 
That thereof made fuch haftc.
At the church-dcor the knights did meet.
The Lady Dacres for to greet, 
But moft of all her daughter fweet, 
That beauteous bonny lafs .
7. Said Arrrftrong to the lady fair.
We both have made a vow, 
At dinner for to be your guefts.
If you will it allow'.
With that befpoke the lady free, 
Sir knights, right welcome you {hall be; 
The happier men therefore are we.
We love this bonny lafs.
8. Thus were the knights both prickâ€™d in love ; 
Both in one moment thrallâ€™d.
And both with one fair lady gay, 
Fair Ifabella call'd.
With humble thanks they went away 
Like wounded harts chasâ€™d all the day, 
One would not to the other fay, 
They loved this bonny lafs.
9. Mean while fair Ifabella too 
As far in love was found, 
So long brave Armftrong {he did eye,

Brave Armllrong is my joy, quoth (he; 
Would Chrift he were alone with me,

With his fair bonny lafs.

But as thefe knights together rode, 
And homeward did repair,

THE FAR1SH OF SALKELD, 
I FREQUENTLY called Great Salkeld or Salkeld Regis, from its being parcel 
of the lands ceded to the King of Scots, and afterwards reaflumed on the 
defection of John Balioi.
It was granted by King William III.
to the anceftor of 
the Duke of Portland.
This paridi is bounded by Edenhall to the fouth, Lazonby 
to the weft and north, and the river Eden to the eaft.
Here is a very picfturefque 
view on the banks of the river, at a place called the Force-mill: the word force , 
though probably, a corruption only of the plural fords , is frequently ufed tn this 
county to defenbe a waterfall or cafcade ; it has the fame acceptation in other 
northern counties; the great fall of the river lees is called the force.
The weftern 
fide is formed by lofty rocks, excavated and cut in niches, confiding of feats in a 
femicircular order for ten or twelve perfons, like the ftalls in ancient cathedrals.
The 
river falls over a broken wear, or dam, or force by innumerable fpouts, in various 
directions.
â€” The oppoiite banks are rocky and over-grown with fhrubs and trees ; 
and in the ftream is a Angular column of tnafonry work, fifteen or fixteen feet in 
height, which appears like the pier of fome ancient bridge, f The whole channel 
of 
f Mr. J.
Sympfon, of Grafmere to whom we confefs our obligations in this article, informs us, â€œ that 
14 he remembers part of another pillar on the fame fide of the river.
That not far from thefe remains, is 
â€œ a quarry of fine white alabafter (gypfum) in the grounds of Samuel Lacey, Lfq.â€ with which he con* 
jeÂ£hircs the pillars were cemented ; and he fpeaks, as from experience, â€œ that when that alabafter is pro- 
Â« perly calcined and made into mortar, it will cement hard like ftone under water.* That o the fame fide, 
â€œ about a mile below, tliere has formerly been a church, but which is now nearly wafhed away by the river; 
it the fituation is on a high bank, like that on which the church.
of Brampton, in Gilftand, ftands.
That 
â€œ when 
* q he people fay that all the goods that were carried between Ncwcaftlc and Penrith, patted over this bridge with, 
pack-horfes, no carriages being then in ufc 5 and the fteepnefs of the banks, on each fide, feems to confirm this idea.

of the river is rocky.
In the year 1360, a bridge at Great Salkeld was taken away 
by floods, for the repairing or re-edifying of which, Bifhop Welton publiflied an 
indulgence of forty days.
We have not been able to afcertain whether the bridge 
was rebuilt on the old fituation.
The prelent bridge is placed at fome diftance 
from the force, and is a Angular compofition of elliptic, femicircular, and pointed 
arches, one fucceeding the other, perhaps, being in part conftrudted out of the 
remains of the old bridge.
It was built about twenty years ago, chiefly of an open 
gritted red-ftone, which doth not promife to be durable.
There is fomething Angular in the form and conflru&ion of the church tower, 
which appears to have been ereded at a different period from the body of the 
church : it has certainly been calculated for a place of defence, and ufed as 
the Aronghold and retreat of the rector, his family, and pariflfloners, in times 
of public danger.
Such, perhaps, was one of the original deflgns of all church 
towers ; and fevere cenfures have been pronounced againfl the parifhioners, in 
other diocefes, particularly in Durham, lor neglecting repairs.
The door opens 
from the church, plaited and defended with iron ; the flrft apartment is vaulted, 
wherein a large table l'tands, that holds an iron helmet and the remains of coats of 
mail.
Several funnels are carried up in the wails, as chimneys to void the Anoke 
which has proceeded from Ares made on the floor ; a circumltance that points out 
its antiquity.
The great hall in the tower of Bambrough in Northumberland, has 
funnels of the like nature, and other ancient places of flrength.
Our guide told 
us dreadful Aories of an unhappy fpirit, that viAts thofe rufly remains of armour, 
which, perhaps, Arengthened his mifdeeds, and he trembled when the poffefled 
head- piece was put on : BiAiop Nicolfon, fuppofed this tower was the work of 
Archdeacon Clole, brother to the bifluop of that name, who was tranflated from 
Car!
ille to LitchAeld in the latter end of Henry VI.
â€™s reign ; but he alAgns no 
reafon for fuch conjecture ; Clofe lies interred in the quire.
Doctor Thomas Mufgrave, w hillt he was archdeacon, made great improvements 
to the parfonage houfe ; and Mr. Nicolfon made fome additions.
The church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and is appropriated to the archdeaconry 
when he vifited the place laft, only a {mail pait of the church-yard remained ; that human bones appeared 
Â« in the bank and others by the lide of the river.
That all the information he could obtain of the place 
Â« was, that they brought the dead out of Allton Moor, in the days of yore, to be interred there;â€™ â€” perhaps 
in the great mortality, in 1598.
This ingenious cor refpondent further informs us, â€œthat in that part of Great Salkeld called the Duke, 
â€œ on the right hand of the road to Penrith, upon the fell, there is an encampment thrown up, about 1200 
â€œ feet in length, and j 2 feet high ; clofe to the encampment is a bafon cf water, circular, and about 50 
Â»â€¢ or 6o yards in diameter, and four or five yards deep ; as all the ground near to the encampment is a 
â€œ plain, probably materials were dug out of that bafon to form the vallum.
â€” That â€” 
â€œ A little more than a quarter of a mile further, towards the north end of the parilh, clofe to the road, 
â€œ on the right hand, are confiderable remains of a fortified ftation, inclofed with a vallum of rough ftones 
â€œ and pebbles, without mortar, now grown over with oak trees and bruftiwood; it is called aka-bur n, and the 
â€œ old people fay it was an ancient caftle.-j- In fome parts of it, arefmall fquare inclofures, fenced in the 
â€œ fame manner ; in one place the appearance of a fire place, or hearth, where fire had frequently been, was 
" difeovered.
That at a little difiance, in the fame parifh, is a tumulus of ftones, called a raife , like to 
â€œ Dunmaile raife ; and at about a quarter of a mile further in Lazonby is another raife , but not fo large.â€ 
| It has the name of Aikton Caftle.

George Benfon , a learned and eminent nonconformift divine, and author of feveral valuable theological 
works, was born here, of a good family, in 1699.
His great grandfather left London towards the lat- 
ter end of Queen Elizabethâ€™s reign, and fettled at this place ; where he raifed a confiderable family.â€” 
From the eldeft.

A free-fchool was founded here in the year 1515, endowed with feveral fmall 
rents and manerial fines, it has been diftrefied with a long litigation touching its 
rights.
George Benfonâ€™s grandfather.
At eleven years of age, he is faid to have been able to read the Greek 
Teftament.
And fuch was the ferioufnefs of his temper, and his attachment to books, that his parents 
determined to educate him for the miniftry.
With this view, after having palled through a courfe of 
grammar learning, he was fent to an academy kept by Dr. Dixon at Whitehaven, where he continued 
about a year ; and from thence was removed to the univeifity of Glafgow, where he completed his aca- 
demical ftudies.
The principles in which he was bred up, were Calvin iftical, and he believed in his eailier 
years, in the doctrine of predeftinaticn ; but farther enquiry and examination led him to exchange his 
opinions on this point ; the fettling of which he thought efl'entially neceflary, before he engaged in the 
miniftry.
This refolution, and this difcuffion, are highly creditable to his good fenfe and his candour.
About the clofe of the year 1721, Mr. Benfon came to London, and having been examined and ap- 
proved by feveral of the moft eminent Prefbyterian minifters, he began to preach firft at Chertfey, and 
afterwards in London.
The learned Dr. Calamy took him into his family, and treated him with great 
kindnefs and friendlhip.
By the recommendation of that gentleman, he afterwards went to Abingdon, 
in Berklhire, and was unanimoufty chofen paftor of the congregation of Proteftant diflenters in that town.
He was ordained in 1 723, Dr. Calamy and five other minifters officiating on the occafion.
At Abingdon 
he remained feven years ; and whillt there, appears to have had fome thoughts of ftudying phyfic.
But 
this defign he laid alide, and devoted all his time to the ftudy of the facred writings, and in labouring to 
inftruft and edify the people under his care.
During his ftay at this place, he preached and published 
three fei ious praftical difeourfes, addrefied to young perfons ; which were well received.
But he'afterwards 
fupprefltd them, as not teaching what he thought, on farther enquiry, the exadt dodtrine, in relation to 
fome interefting points of Chriftianity.
In 1726, he married Mrs. Elizabeth Hills, a widow ; with 
whom he lived very happily, for fourteen years.
In 1728, he received an invitation, which he accepted, 
to become minifter to a congregation in King Johnâ€™s Court, Southwark; among whom he laboured with 
great diligence and fidelity for eleven years, and was greatly beloved by them.
The light which the celebrated Mr. Locke had thrown upon fome of the moft obfeure and difficult 
parts of St. Paulâ€™s epiftles, by his clofe attention to the original defign with which they were written, 
and by carefully perilling the thread of the authorâ€™s reafoning, induced and encouraged Mr. Benfon, as 
it had before induced Mr. Price, to attempt the illuftration of the other epiftles of St. Paul in a fimilar 
method.
Accordingly in 173 r, he publifhed, in 4to, â€œ A Paraphrase and Notes on St. Paulâ€™s Epiftle 
â€œ to Philemon, attempted in Imitation of Mr Lockeâ€™s Manner,â€ with an Appendix ; in which is 
fhewn, â€œ that St. Paul could neither be an enthufiaft nor an impoftor ; and confequently that the 
â€œChriftian religion muft be, (as he has reprefented it) heavenly and divine.â€ It is well known, that 
the argument of this Appendix hath iince been improved and illuftrated with great force and elegance by 
the late Lord Lyttleton.
Mr. Benfonâ€™s firft publication on the epiftles meeting with a very favourable reception, he proceeded, 
with great diligence and increafing reputation, to publilh paraphiafes and notes on the two Epiftles to the 
Theftalonians, the ill and 2d Epiftle to Timothy, and the Epiftle to Titus; adding diftertations on 
feveral important fubjedts ; and particularly on infpiration.
In 1 735, he publifhed, in three thin volumes 
4to, â€œ The Hiftory of the Firft Planting of the Chriftian religion, taken from the Adis of the Apoftles, 
â€œ and their Epiftles : together with the remarkable Fadls of the Jewifli and Roman Pliftory, which 
â€œ affedled the Chriftians within that period.â€ 
In 1 740, he was chefen paftor of the congregation of Proteftant diftenters in Crutched Friars, London, 
in the room of Dr. William Harris ; and in this fituation he continued till his death.
It appears that, 
about this time, lie alfo received an invitation to become joint -paftor of the Prefbyterian congregation at 
Birmingham with Mr. Samuel Bourn ; but this he declined.
In Crutched Friars, he had, feveral years, as 
his affiftant, the very eminent and learned Dr Lardner ; and they conftantly lived together in the greateft 
friendfhip.
Nor was this in the leaft interrupted, when the increafing bodily infirmities of Dr. Lardner 
obliged him to defift from the public exercife of the miniftry.
In 1 742, Mr. Benfon married Mrs. Mary 
Kettle, daughter of Mr. William Kettle, of Birmingham ; a lady of a very amiable character ; his 
former wife having beeu dead about two years.
In 1743, be published in 8vo, â€œ The Reafonablenefs

Dr. Benfon's indefatigable application to his (Indies, and his conftant preaching, at length impaired 
his conftitution ; and he found it neceffary to quit the public exercife of the miniftry.
But it was too late 
to reap all the benefit fo ardently prayed for by his friends, even from reft and retirement.
He died in a 
very compofed and refigned manner, on the 6th of April, 1762, in the lixty -third year of his age.
He was a man of great piety and learning ; intenfely ftudious; and unwearied in Inâ€™s refearches after 
theologieal truth.
This was the great bufmefs of his life.
His temper was naturally ferious ; but in 
the company of his friends, he was chearful ; and loved the converfation of men of letters, efpecially thofe 
whofe ftudics were (imilar to his own.
He was fhort-lighted ; which was fome inconvenience to him in 
the public delivery of his difeourfes ; but his appearance was grave and venerable; and the earneftnefs of 
his manner made ample amends for the inconvenience of his fhort-fightednefs.
He was of no ordinary fervice to good learning and piety, by diredtiiig and aflifting young divines in 
the critical ftudy of the feriptures ; and for many years he had one or more living with him, who applied 
to this ftudy under his eye.
Several of thefe have done honour to their tutor ; two of whom it cannot be 
improper particularly to mention, becaufe of their eminence in the republic of letters, Dr. Macknight, 
auther of â€œ the Harmony of the Golpels and the Rev. Mr.
John Alexander, a young divine among 
the diffenters, of the 1110ft promifmg talents and chara&er.
He went to bed on the 28th of December, 
1 765, in perfeft health, between eleven and twelve oâ€™clock, juft after finifliing a fermon which he intended 
to preach next day ; hut at fix next morning was found dead in his bed, with the fermon in his hand, in 
the 29th year of his age.
Mr. Palmer, focn after his death, publifhed â€œ a paraphrafe upon the xvth 
â€œ chapter of the ifc epiftlc to the Corinthians ; with critical notes and obfervations, and a preliminary

an interefting publication.
Dr. Benfon left behind him in MS.

Dr. Benfon was a remarkble inftance of the happy effeXs of a learned induftry It is well known, that 
he was not a man of great original genius ; that he had fmall powers of invention and fancy ; and that 
he had not applied to the cultivation of elegance and tafte in compofition.
When at the univerfity, we 
are affured that he was thought to be but a dull lad by his fellcw-ftudents, and that they expelled nothing 
confiderable from him.
But, by the force of application, he out-ftripped his more lively companions, 
and produced works of real and lading utility and merit.

It was fettled upon the iflue male of a 
younger branch of the Dacres, with limitations over to the heirs general of that 
family, which carried the inheritance over to the lords Dacre of the fouth.
Leonard Dacre, whilft he was feized, with his Brothers Edward and Francis, were 
attainted 12th Queen Elizabeth, for their adherence to Mary Queen of Scots.
It 
has been conjectured that their execution was refpited, to preferve thofe limited 
ellates to the crown and prevent their immediate reverfion to the next in re- 
mainder.
On the death of Leonard, 21ft Queen Elizabeth, a commiflion iffued 
to inquire of his eftate and effe&s; and on the inquifition it was returned, that 
Philip Earl of Arundel in right of Anne his wife, and Lord William Howard in 
in which is comprehended great part of Plumpton.
The land towards Eden is light with a mixture of 
gravel, producing a few turnips, (which tor want of proper culture was not a third part of what the foil 
would bear) pretty good bailey, rye, oats, and peas, and little wheat; with proper attention wheat would 
do well.
Near Armathwaite, the foil is ftrong and bears good wheat â€” Artificial graffes would be pro- 
ductive, but aie negledted.
Towards Peterel the foil is ftrong and loamy, and in fummers when there are 
moderate rains, produces heavy crops of grain; but the chief part is held in pafturage and meadow, which 
are more profitable than corn, from the number of droves of cattle that pafs, and want refreftiment, for 
which a high price is paid.
Commons, j Particularly the northern traCts, called the Low Plains, afford excellent dry pafturage 
for fheep.
Aspect, Wood.
&c.3 On the banks of the Eden the lands incline towards the eaft, on Peterel to- 
wards the weft.
â€” At the northern extremity is a large foreft of oaks, called baron wood, belonging to Sir 
Philip Mufgrave; veiy few trees are Handing in the inclofures, which are chiefly fenced with walls.

Antiquities.
3 Befides the ftation called Old Penrith, and the great Roman road extending from north 
to fouth, there is another road leading to Salkeld bridge â€” urns were found about twenty years ago on the 
fell, by a perfon winning ftones, they contained bones and afhes.
Several cairns are on the commons, and 
at a place called Caftle Rigg the ruins of a building appear, moated round.
In Baron Wood is a very high 
rock, in which is a cave of confiderable fize, apparently artificial; it is called the giants chamber a name 
common to thofe hiding places, where out-laws and men who lived by rapine, the terror of the country were 
fecreted, in thofe wretched times when little fecurity was known to the inhabitant.
Such beings had the 
fame horrible denomination in ether ages and countries ; it was an appellation given to every monfter of 
tyranny and violence.

the hands of the crown; and that Francis Dacre was living, having ifiue male.
Ranulph the grandfon of Francis, the laft male iflue of that line, died 10th King 
Charles I.
yet the crown continued in pofiefiion of Lazonby, until 1657, when 
Francis Lord Dacre of the fouth, under the before-mentioned limitation, recovered 
in the exchequer, with the profits that had accrued from the time of the death of 
R.anulph.
From that time this manor continued in the pofiefiion of the family of 
Dacres, until about the year 1716, when it was bought by Sir Chriftopher 
Mufgrave from the coheirefles of Thomas Earl of Sufifex.
There is a fmall mefne manor within Lazonby, the property of Timothy Fca- 
therftonhaugh, Efq. of Kirkofwald.
The church of Lazonby was given by Sir Hugh de Morvill to Lanercoft priory, 
and was foon afterwards, in the Year 1272, appropriated.
A difpute in 1484, 
arifing between Boon the vicar, and the prior and convent, about fmall tithes, 
Bifhop Bell being foie referee, awarded to the vicar.
In this vicarâ€™s time, the 
bounds between the Pari fines of Penrith and Lazonby, were afeertained by a jury, 
as fet forth in the note.J 
Upon the diflTolution, the redlory was granted by King Edward VI.
to Sir 
Thomas Dacre, knight.
It was afterwards purchafed by Dr. John Barwick, dean 
of St. Paulâ€™s, and given to the chapel and poor of Witherflack, in Wefimorland, 
paying thereout yearly, forty (hillings to the vicar.
Sir Hugh de Morvill aifo gave lands heie to the Abbey of Holm Cultram, viz.
pafture at Lazonby for 500 (beep, 10 oxen, 10 cows and their followers of one

Plumpton Park 1 in this parijh , being a diflinPi chapelry , in which lies Old 
Penrith, the Pelriana of Camden , and Rremeienracum of Horjley, will be treated rf in 
the further progrefs of this work.
CAVES CALLED ISIS PAR LIS.
As we are now to pafs the boundary of the county, in order to view Brougham, 
Arthur's round Table, and Maybrough,on our way to Penrith,* we fhall here give an 
account of the caves cut in the rocks impending over the river Eamont, oppoiitc 
to Saint Ninianâ€™s, vulgarly called Nine churches.
Thefe caves have often been vifited, but their poflefibrs or ufe have not yet been 
afeertained.
This is the only place we know, in the neighbourhood, likely to 
have been the retreat of a hermit, cr perhaps here was Sir Hugh's Parlour , men- 
tioned in our account of Penrith.
The caves are formed about the middle of a 
perpendicular rock, which rifes immediately from the brink of the river, and only 
ro be approached by palling along narrow edges of the cliffs, and holding by the 
flirubs.
One is bu.
a narrow recefs, hewn in the cliffs for a day fhelter or feat ; 
the other is chiefly natural, and capacious enough to hold a great number of 
people.
It has had a door and window, formed in the Jaws of the cave, by mafon- 
uork; a column, which has at once been the jamb of the door and window, remains 
fianding, with the marks of iron gratings, hinges, &c.
The opening, or mouth 
of the cave has lately been greatly altered in form, by the falling of fome of the 
upper flones.
There appears no marks of a tool in this cave, except on the right 
hand fide of the entrance, where a recefs or alcove is cut out; leaving a plain or 
bench about two feet above the level of the floor, capable of receiving a matrafs 
for the reclufe to reft upon.
The roof hangs in a fhaken and tremendous form, 
and the whole is miferably dark and damp : there is no appearance of a fire place.
1 he engraving annexed, will give the befi idea of this cavern.
The editor of Camden fpeaks of this pi ice in the following w T ords ; â€” Half a 
" mile above the confluence of Eden and Eimot, on the very bank of the former, 
*' is a grotto of two rooms dug out of the rocks, and called Ifts Parlis , (in Mr.
" Gough's edition, Tfan Parlis) to which there is a difficult and perilous paffage.
"In former times it was certainly a place of ftrength and fecurity Â» for it had iron 
" gates belonging to it, which were fianding not many years fince.
To this we 
" fubjoin what other authors have related, â€” That the vulgar tell fl range fiories 
" of one Ifir, a giant, who lived here in former times, and, like Cacus of old, 
" feized men and Cattle, and drew them into his den to devour them.
But it is 
" highly probable, that thefe fubterraneous chambers were made fora fecure retreat 
" in time of fudden danger; and the iron gates, which were taken away not long 
" ago, do not a little confirm that fuppofition.â€

BROUGHAM CASTLE.
T HAT extenfive ruin, fituated on the banks of the river Eamont, graces the 
landfcape viewed from Carleton-Hall.
The entrance is by a michicolated gateway and rower, a diort covered way leads 
to an inner gateway, with iron-grated gates : the dungeon tower, or keep , rifes in 
the midd of the area, a (lately edifice of excellent mafonry ; all the inner apart- 
ments are deftroyed, except one vault, which, we conceive was the dernier re- 
treat for the family in time of affault ; the roof of this vault is formed of groined 
arches, fupported by an oclagon pillar in the centre ; the whole is elegantly finifhed 
with chifleled work, and ornamented with fculpture, fuch as was the tafie of the 
Norman architects, viz.
faces and didorted figures.
To this apartment you 
defeend by fevcral deps, and, as there are no apertures to admit the light, feverat 
rings are fixed in the roof for lamps; the out-works are in fuch a ruined (late, 
that it is not poffible to trace what offices they confided of ; to the fouth-wed angle 
of the outward wall is a bulwark, or drong tower, all the inner chambers of which 
are alfo dedroyed ; the outward gateway is vaulted with common arches, having a 
port cullis ; the arms of Vaux (Chegny, Or, and Gules) dill remain on the tower.
The inner gateway is alfo vaulted, but is formed of groined arches, with a port- 
cullis ; by the difference of the archite<ffu.re, it feems as if the outward gateway and 
tower had been added to the work, they appear of a more modern date.
To the: 
north the river Eamont w a flies the facia or the cadle wall.
The mod ancient owner of Brougham Cadle that hidory points out, was John 
de Veteripont ; but the indruments wherein his name is mentioned call it only the 
honje oj Brougham, fo that probably it was not at that time cadellated.
We have 
certain evidence that the fird Roger Lord Clifford built many parts of this cadle; 
above the inner gateway is placed this infeription : â€” <l This made Roger,â€ c â€˜ which 
â€œ fome would have (fays Bifhop Nicolfonâ€™s MS.

â€˜ f much of i.is raiding the cadle, as of the cadle raifing him , in allufion to his great 
â€œ advancement of fortune by his marriage, this cadle being part of his wifeâ€™s in- 
â€œ her dance.â€ By an inquifition, pod mortem, taken of the poffeffions of Robert, 
fon of the before-named Roger, we find he died (eized of this cadle, with 160 
acres of land, worth yearly, according to the efiimate of that time, fourpence per 
acre, and 40 acres of meadow, worth i2d.
per acre ; that he held alfo three cot- 
terels, (the old word in Doomfday book for cottage) and a mill there.
Roger de Clifford, grand(on of Robert, built the chief parrs of the cadle, to the 
ead, which comprehend the keep, and parts facing the river Eamont ; there he 
placed his arms quartered with the Warwdcks, in right of Maud his wife.
In the 4th year of the reign of Henry IV.
this fortrefs, with the deme(ne, were 
fo ruined and defolated by the Scots, that on inquifition then taken, they were re- 
turned worth nothing, by reafon of the devafiation made by the enemy.
How 
long this fortrefs lay in ruin is not knowm, but it is mod probable it did not un- 
dergo a fpeedy repair ; for the fird mention made of it in hidory from that

there on the 6th, 7th, and 8th days of Auguft, 1617, on 
his return the laft time from Scotland.
It is fuppofed the Caftle had been injured 
by fire foon after the royal vifit; for in 1651, and 1652, thecountefs of Pembroke 
reftored it.
and put up the following memorial, cut in Hone in capital letters: â€” 
â€œ This caftle of Brougham was repaired by the Ladie Anne Clifford, Countefte 
â€œ Dowager of Pembroke, Dorfett, and Montgomery, Baroncffe Clifford, Weft- 
â€œ morland and Vefcie, Ladie of the Honor of Skipton in Craven, and High 
â€œ Sheriife, by inheritance, of the countie of YVeftmoriand, in the years 1651 and 
â€œ 1652, after it had layen ruinous fcvcr fince, abour Auguft 1617, when King 
â€œ James lay in it for a time in his journie out of Scotland towards London, untill 
â€œ this time.â€.
Since her time it has gradually gone to decay, and much of the in- 
terior walls have lately been removed alfo, for the purpofes of building houfcs for 
the adjoining farmhold.
Wh in r if l d Park, is in view from hence â€” the ring, or fibula, of which we have 
given a reprcfentarion and defcription,f was found by a perfon following the plough 
on fome lands lately taken up in tillage there.
When the drawing of it was made, 
the antique was in the polfellion of Mrs. Atkinfon, of Temple-Sowerby, who fee 
a great value on it.
The road here leads diredtly along the old Roman way.
The Roman antiquities 
found at Brougham, and in the neighbourhood, we have mentioned in the notes.

+ This was Found in the Year 1778, in IV hi afield Park, turned up by the plough, is of pure gold, and 
weighs 19 d\v.
The clafping hands are neatly executed, and the letters of the motto aie raifed to admit 
a ground of enamel; it being groved in, apparently for that purpofe.
It has been a fibula.
There is a 
notch to receive the poiDt of the tongue, and the ring has been cut through on the oppofite fide: in the 
ends, holes for receiving a centre pin appear.
â€” From the motto, it muft have been for female ufe: 
To ye then my trought I pligl t, 
And to ye Mary, his moder bright.
This comprehends a vow of troth ar.d marriage, of which the ring has been the pledge.
The words his 
moder bright want fome elucidation, to fhew they coirefpond critically with the vow, and prove the gift 
was for female ufe: but what part of a womanâ€™s garment was cl ifped by a fibula, is diffiicult to determine.
The words his moder bright mean his excellent maiden or virgin: bright is an old h ngliih word of com- 
mon accep ation.
Moder is a corruption of the Danifii word mocr, â€œ fignifying a virgin or maiden ; the 
â€œ people of Norfolk in fome meafure letain the word to this day.
Norfolk was given to the Danes by 
â€œ King Alfred 876; it was totally inhabited by them, and their cuftoms, laws, and fpeech were there 
â€œ ufed.
They call virgins and young maids mocr, as Olaus Wormius teftifies Fai. Dan lib.

It may be neceflary here, confident with our plan of this Hiftory, to fettle the 
true etymology of this name of Brougham, and refcue it from an error hitherto 
adopted ; not indeed without fome plaufibility, from its fimilitude in the old way 
of writing it (Burgham) to names of Saxon origin.

This belongs aifo to the

The ftone which I have given the draught of 
â€œ is at prefent at Appleby ; but I will not vouch for its being the original, which Camden faw, or at leaft 
â€œ mentions.
It was found in the year 1602, near the confluence of the rivers Lodar and Eimot, near 
â€œ this ftation.
It is in honour of the Emperor Conftantine the Great, and of a later date than that 
â€œ which was found upon the wall, and may be feen in this collection (lxxi Northumberland) as is mani-

To this fame ftation muft be referred another infcription, whofe original I would gladly have recover-

According to Burton and Gale, it was found near Lowther or at leaft was to be

But I was told of two or three Hones, with inferiptions upon them, which the mafons had 
lately deftroyed at .Appleby, and perhaps this might be one of that number.

Dr. Galeâ€™s remark upon it is this, â€” â€œ I read,â€ fays he, â€œ Bramae vexillatio Germanorum.
The Des 
Matres were in great efteem among the Germans, as appears from many inferiptions in Gruter and Reme- 
â€œ fins.â€ But it is evident from the infcription now at Great Salkeld, in Cumberland, that the true 
reading muft be Deabus Tramar, for Tramaiinis.
The letters and Hops in the beginning of the third 
are certainly wrong, and perhaps it has been no more than Norum, that is, vexillatio Germanorum ; and

The words vexillatio Germariorum, may ferve to illuftrate, and may be illuftrated by a paffage or two 
in Suetonius and Tacitus.
For we have vexillatio Germanorum in the one, and Germanorum vcxilla 
m the other.
Some read Germaniciorum or Gertnanicorum in Suetonius : but I think the evidence that 
appears here is deciiive in favour of Germanorum.
Excepting the Germans, we feldom or never have the 
vexillatio of any but legionary foldiers, either in the Roman hiftorians, or any of our Roman inferiptions 
in Britain.
I remember none in this colledlion, but the vexillatio Verdulorurn Craneorum, which is not 
altogether certain, and if it was, fure muft be horfe.
The Germans feem to be fpoken of, and fit for 
expedition, and are particularly on feveral occafions famed for their fwiming.
Tacitus tells us, â€œ That 
the Roman foldiers being loaded with their arms, were afraid to fwhn, but the Germans were accufomcd to 
it, and qualified for it, by the lightnefs of their arms, and tallnefs of their bodies.â€ If the notion of vexillarii 
and vexillatior, which I have already endeavoured to eftablifii, be right, we may hence be furnilhed with 
good reafon why there ftrould be vexillations of Germans, rather than of any other auxiliary forces.â€ 
N. B.
We have added to this collection the inferiptions difeovered at Crawdundale, as being adjacent 
to this ftation.
They are differently reprefented by the editors of Camden and Mr. Horfiey, and therefore 
we ftiall prefent them to the reader as they are cliaraClered and defined by thofe learned antiquaries.

For 
which reafon one may conclude them to be different inferiptions; and the rudenefs of the character in the 
firft, muff needs argue it to be of much gt eater antiquity.
And what may the more induce us to believe 
them two diftimft inferiptions, is the writing of the letter A, which, in Varroniu\> wants the crofs ftroke; 
whereas all the three in the two lad lines, are according to the common way of writing.]] The Legio

which was in garrifon at Ifca, or Caer-Leon, in Wales, being both detached againft the enemy in thefe 
parts, feem to have fixed and pitched their camps for fome time in this place; and it is probable that 
the officers, in memory thereof might engrave this in the rock.
Or what if one (hould lay, that this 
was the place which afforded the Romans a fupply of ftones for their buildings hereabouts; and that 
upon this account the infciiptions were left here?
The truth of the faeft appears, from the ftones dug 
up out of the foundations of Kirkby Thore, mod: of which did certainly come from hence; and that up- 
on thofe occalions they ufed to leave inferiptions behind them, is confirmed by the like inftanccs, both in

And in Mr. Bainbvidgeâ€™s copy they are the fame.
But by Camdenâ€™s account they feem to have been

However I fuppofe the names have been taken for Odftavius

The two inferiptions are both but rude, and the upper one efpecially, feems 
to have been worked with a common pick, or fome fuch tool.
They are now upon two diftindt pieces 
cf the rock, that have fallen off from the grand one, and are laid one upon the other, as here reprefented.

applies the nrlt fy liable of that name to the word caftle, and not to the ward 
town; he fays, vol.
VII.
p. 63.
â€” â€œ There is an old caftle on the fide of Eden 
â€œ water, called Burgh , about a line from the caftle is a village called Burgham .â€ â€” 
Iiam , in this inftance, would therefore fignify town, in order to produce the 
word Caftle-Town, according to the above author; but it is evident that every 
town, lituated as this was, near a caftle, would alfo have received the fame name, 
whereas there is not another inftance of the name of Brugham, or Brougham, in the 
whole ifland.
Neither of the above arrangements of two Saxon words is, in truth, 
juft ; this name is not a compound, but a colle&ive corruption of Brovoniacum , the 
Roman name, fo called long before the Saxons came over to Britain, which was 
not till the year 449.
Had the Saxons been the firft comers, the caftle, confider- 
ed as fuch, might indeed have continued its name from Saxon etymology to this 
day ; but Julius Csefarâ€™s firft expedition to Britain was 54 years before Chrift, the 
ifland had been reduced to an entire and civilized province of the Roman empire 
in the 4th year ol Domitianâ€™s reign, 138 years after Caefarâ€™s firft entrance, A.
D. 
85, but it was not till 449, that Vortigern, King of the Britons, fent for the Saxons, 
with the concurrence of a grand council, which he affembled, to aflift him againft 
his enemies, after the Romans had retired.
The Saxons too were no builders of 
caftles ; Malmfoury tells us, p.
102, that the great diftindtion between the 
â€œ Anglo-Saxons, and the French and Normans, was, that rh t latter built magnifi- 
â€œ cent and fiately caftles, whereas the former confirmed their fortunes in mean 
â€œ houles.â€ It is well known alfo, that the Roman ways and Rations continued to 
retain through the ifland their names, with fome changes only of the original word 
in general ; in fome inftances indeed the name has been fupplied by another, yet 
that lubflitute has been Roman.
An inftance of near retention of the ancient 
name, is the Aballaba of the Romans, now called Appleby ; Mt. Horfley doubts 
indeed whether the Appleby of Weflmorland was the true Aballaba, thinking that 
to be the Gallacum rather of the Romans, and fays it is not peculiar to that place, as 
there is an Appleby in Berbyjhire , in Leicefterjhire , and alfo in Lincolnjhtre Mr.
Burn goes as high as Hebrew origin for this name of Appleby, fuppofing the Romans 
name of Varronius, perhaps Leffus, which we have in Gruter.
The C, which, in Camdenâ€™s copy, is 
prefixed to Vaironius, is now fcarce difcernible.
It does not appear to me from the infeription, what 
office this Varronius bore in the Legion, or whether any at all; unle/s the C that Hands before the 
name ihould be read Centurio.
The (hape of the E, at the beginning of the fecond line, is remarkable.
Aelius l ucanus is alfo made Pra;feÂ£tus Lcgicnis in the reading in Camden ; but in the original it is 
neither a P, as in the copy at Appleby, nor an R only as in the copy in Camden, but T.
R. which I 
think mud Hand for Tribunus.
The C, at the end, is read in Camden, Cnftrametati funt.
If that be 
the word, I Ihould rather chufe the fingular Caftrametatus eft, and fuppofe them not only two inferiptions, 
but alfo cut at different times.

But I have already fpoken to this matter.
â€œ It is not improbable thefe inferiptions were cut, when the Romans were getting {tones here for fome

And fome have imagined, from the nearnefs of the place, and the nature of the grit

conjectural as this is as to the precife Aballaba, or the Galiacum of the Romans,

Brovoniacum is to Btougham, and it is as certain that there is no family of the

302 
FAMILY OF BROUGHAM.
Of the above account, Henry, who died in 1612, was the firft of this family 
poflefting property in Cumberland.
The eftate of Scales, in this county, was 
then a fmall farm only, and was, according to Dr, Toddâ€™s MS.
purchafed by that 
Henry, fon of Peter, of the family of Southaikes, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, 
in the 34th of whofe reign, John Southaike, Efq. was fheriff for Cumberland ; 
this fmall property was extended by additional purchafes, when Henry, grand- 
fon of the firft purchafer erected the houfe there, fince called Sales-Hall, con- 
cerning which, as well to fubftantiate the fact of his being the firft of the family 
relident there, as to exhibit a fpecimen of the fimplicity and the precifion in de- 
tail but little more than a century back, we fhall give it in the words of the au- 
thor, from Bifhop Nicolfonâ€™s MSS.
p. 564.
of â€œ a curfory relation of all the anti- 
u quitiesand families of Cumberland, writ about the year 1675.
Next adjoining, 
c â€˜ Squire Browham, antient heir male of all the Squire Browhams, of Browham- 
Hall, in Weftmorland, built him a very fine houfe at Scales, and lives there.
C( His grandfather, Henry Browham, married Jane Wharton, daughter of Squire 
â€œ Wharton, of Kirkby-Thore, in Weftmorland.
His father, Thomas, married 
â€œ Mary, daughter to Squire Daniel Fleming, of Skirwith, and coufin to Squire 
â€œ Fleming, Lord of Ridall, and this Squire Browham married fair Mifs Slee, 
â€œ daughter of Mr. Slee, of Carlifle, a jovial gentleman, and of eftate 300I.
â€œ a-year.â€ 
John feventh, child of the above Henry, who was commonly called the 
Commiftioner Brougham, and who had reftded at Scales fince his fatherâ€™s death, 
purchafed the ancient family poffeftion in Weftmorland of the Birds, then owners 
of it, and entailed it in the male line; but this Cumberland property not 
pafting under the lame entail of the commiftioner, the late pofteftor, Henry, 
devifed it to his younger children, who fold it to Peter Lamplugh, of Dovenby, 
Efq. the prefent gentleman having declined to purchafe ir, not confidering it to be 
any part of the ancient pojfejjions of the family : upon the purchafe of Brougham- 
Hall, the commiftioner, attended by fome friends, rode from Scales to take 
pofteftion, and had the fatisfa<ftion ol being prefented with a Iquare block of ftone 
found the fame morning by the workmen who were digging there, on which were 
the arms of the family, and which he caufed to be fixed on the front of the houfe 
at Brougham, where it yet remains.
Having mentioned the name of Bird, it is neceflary to fay, that for a length of 
time this eftate had been in the pofteftion of a James Bird, ufually known by the 
name of Lawyer Bird, whofe family came from Burdofwald, in Gilfland, and 
were fettled at Clifton Dykes, about a mile from Brougham-Hall ; he had pro- 
perty in the neighbourhood of Brougham, and by purchafe of the heirefs of the 
then owner of one-third of this eftate (lor it had, previous to that, been divided by 
marriage connexions) he firft got a footing at the hall, having before lived at his 
own houfe , near it, as very particularly detailed in Bilhop Nicolfonâ€™s MSS.
p. 118.
Then the great Roman way brings you to the caftle of Browham, near which 
11 was a Roman camp, having on the left Browham, and Browham-Hall, the feat 
(( of the Browhams.
From this caftle you have the profpedt of Lowther-Hall, 
ft Clifton-Hall; and likewife of Penrith, Penrith caftle, and Carleton-Hall ; 
" likewife 
MANOR OF BROUGHAM.
303 
" likewife of Browham-HalL Browham chapel, and Mr. Bird's Houfe , all which 
Â«Â« lye in the way, if you go by the bridges from hence to Penrith.
â€™ This James 
Bird was a Iteward to the Earl of Thanet, and being already in poffellion by the 
above purchale, of one-third eft this elfate, he afterwards purchafed another third, the 
remaining third , having alfo been purchafed before of its pofleft'orby Anne, Countefs 
Dowager of Pembroke, M as now conveyed to him by her grandfon, the Honour- 
able John Tufton, of Bolebrooke, in the county of Suffex, by indentures, bearing 
date 1676, conveying, inter alia, â€œ to the faid James Bird, all that the manor or 
Â« third part of the manor of Brougham, which the late Anne, Countefie Dowager of 
tf Pembroke, had purchafed,â€ &c.
&c.
of which more will be faid in its place.
Thus the three parts of this eftate and manor, which had long been feparately 
enjoyed, were now united in the name of Bird : the hall, when he came to refide 
there, obtained the name of Birdneft , which he called it partly on account of his 
name, and partly from the appearance of the houfe at that time, which was almoft: 
hid by trees, the chimneys only being in view, and even to this day many old 
people in the neighbourhood know it by no other name.
This Lawyer Bird 
however was under the neceffity of palling it to his grand children by its ancient 
name, the conveyance of it being recited in his will, (now in the polfdlion of the 
prefent owner) by the words, â€œ my manfion of Brougham-Hall.â€ 
John Brougham, the commiftioner, repurchafed the eftate and manor of thefe 
grand children of James Bird, in 1726, and entailed it, as has been faid, on his 
family in the male line.
It is now enjoyed by his grand nephew, Henry- 
Brougham.
THE MANOR OF BROUGHAM.
Of which little more need be faid, than that it has aborigine been in this family, 
was fometimes in the hands of one, as in Odard de Burgham, in the reign of 
Henry II.
and at others divided : in the reign of Edward I.
for inftance, a William 
de Crackenthorp and Henry Rydin were lords, who had married two lifters of the 
houfe of de Burgham, and thus it continued changing its proprietors till the reign 
of Henry VII, when, by an inquilition on a quo warranto , it was found that John 
de Burgham died feized of the manor, and was fuooeeded by his fon John; the 
manor had no connection with the caftle ; " this caftle of Brougham (as Burn 
â€œ rightly obferves) was feparate from and independant of the manor.â€ Robert 
de Veteripont (fays Sir Matthew Hale) â€œ had a grant from King John of the 
Â«Â« liberties of free wairen and free chace only over the whole foreft of Oglebird, in 
â€œ which this manor is included ; but it was not till Oliver Cromwellâ€™s time that 
** the famous Countefs of Pembroke poftefted any part of the manor or eftate in 
â€œ fee; and (he then purchafed of its owner one third only , which fhe appro- 
" priated, in 1654, for the maintenance of her hofpital at Appleby, at that time 
Â«* endow ed, and alfo to pay 4I.
yearly to the poor of Brougham, relerving to her- 
â€œ felf certain rights alfo, and two years after.

Butin 1676, her fuccefTor fold to James Bird, as before-mentioned, this her 
only property in the manor, together with all her rights, as recited by an inden- 
ture, ((till in the pofleflion of the family at Brougham) between James Bird, of 
Brougham, gentleman, of the one part, and the Honourable John Tufton, of 
Bolebroke, in the county of Suflex, grandfon of the faid countefs, John Dalftone, 
of Milrigge, in the county of Cumberland, Efq. and Samuel Grady, of Brougham, 
clerk, of the other part, of date 1676, fetting forth that, whereas the faid John 
Tufton had granted to the faid James Bird all that the manor or third part of the manor 
of Brougham, which the late Anne, Countefs Dowager of Pembroke, had purchas- 
ed, and alfo divers cuftomary melTuages, with all mines , quarries , rents, fines y boons , 
Cervices , and other appurtenances, (excepting the hofpital lands) he the faid James 
Bird grants an annuity or rent charge of 4I.
iftuable out of certain lands at Yan- 
with, to be paid on March 25th, at the chapel of Brougham, and diftributed by 
the minifter and churchwardens of the parifh of Brougham, on the 2d day of 
April yearly, among the poor people of the faid parifh, at a certain pillar lately 
created in a place called Winter Clofe, by the faid countefs deceafed.
And it is to 
be noticed from this authentic document, that this property of the countefs, con- 
veyed by her fuccefTor to James Bird, was not burthened with payment of the 4I.
to the poor, he covenanting to pay from his eftate at Yanwith, which eftate is no 
part of this manor, but cuftomary under the houfe of Lowther, and it continues 
to this day a rent charge on that farm, which was afterwards purchafed of Birdâ€™s 
family by the anceftors of the prefent owner, John Nicolfon, who pays it annually, 
according to the covenant.
By the above purchafe, therefore, of James Bird 
from John i ufton, of this remaining third of the manor, two thirds of which he 
before enjoyed, the whole became entire and undivided in himfelf, and has, fince that 
time, been/o handed down to the prefent poftefTor of the eftate, by Commifiioner 
Brougham, who repurchafed, (as has been faid) this ancient family property of 
the grand children of James Bird.
BROUGHAM CHAPEL, 
From its vicinity To the hall, (as rep refen ted in the annexed plate) commonly 
occafioning enquiries as to its ufe, it may be fatisfa<ftory to our readers to account 
for its making a part of the coup d'oeil ; the ground on which it ftands was part 
of the purchafe formerly of Anne, Countefs of Pembroke, who held the advowfon 
of the living of Brougham, by inheritance from Robert de Vetripont, her anceftor, 
to whom Gilbert de Burgham fold it in the reign of King John, or the beginning 
of Henry III.
and the church being three miles diftant from the weft end of the 
parifh, flie erefted 165S and 16^9, for the convenience of the inhabitants on that

Â« now accommodated alone by the chapel/â€™ in which afternoon fervice is per- 
formed, when the family are refident, by the rector, who does duty in the forenoon 
of Sundays only at the parijh church , and who having long fince received land 
nearer to the reft of his glebe, and more to his convenience, in exchange for this 
ground, from the family, it is now their property.
The late Mr. Brougham 
provided a new fet of necelfaries for the chapel, viz.
books fringed cloaths for the 
communion table, pulpit and reading defk, furpiices &c.
â€” Burials were never per- 
formed there, though baptifms were, and the font is at this day as entire as when- 
firfteredted; but the chief of the family have been baptized and buried in the 
parifn church of Brougham, as appears by the regifter there, at leaft by fo much 
of it as remains entire, which is from the.
year 1558, and in which is the entry of 
an order iigned Henry Curliol, (the then Bifhop of Carlifle ) to the churchwardens 
of Browham, to appoint a convenient place in the parifti church for Mr. Thomas 
Browham and his family, according to an order made by his majeftyâ€™s court 
ecclefiaftical, dated 17th Auguft, 1607.
This order concludes thus, as certifi- 
cation of entry,- â€œ The above is certified by Humphry Clofe, clerk, to be a true

We next vifited the feat of the family, which has laft claimed our attention, 
BROUGHAM-HALL.
This delightful manfion, from its confpicuous fituation on a fieep declivity, arreft* 
the eve and occafions the enquiry of all travellers, as every one mud neceffarily 
pafs in view, w hether going by the great York road, or that of Lancafbire, to 
Penrith, w hich mull be a circumffance alfo of no fmall account to the family re- 
fiding there, as it affords a feene of uninterrupted gaiety, too generally w anted in 
country reiidences; as this well-known lituation muff be familiar to moll of our 
readers, palling in a general view of it, we fhall give a more particular one of its 
various beauties, which can be critically judged of only by vifiting the place itfelf.
It has not improperly been fiiled by painters, in their excurfions, The Windfor of 
the North , as well from its elevation, as its extenfive and varied profpe&s from the 
terrace ; the houfe has a long front to the weft, much of the ancient part is 
ftill remaining, with mullioned windowâ€™s, and an embrafured parapet.
The late 
owner erected a new building to the fouth, the apartments of which are cdla- 
gonal, and in good tafte.
In the old part of the houfe the rooms have fquared 
ceilings, ornamented wdth coats of armour in ftucco work, carved mantle pieces, 
with foliage, fruit, and arms.
The hall, which is lofty, has five Gothic win- 
dows, each completely fitted up with painted glafs, feme of which is of the 
old ftain, and has anciently been there, (particularly the arms of the family 
over the door) fome is of the modern painters, and placed there by the late Mr.
Brougham, the whole was completed and arranged, as it now is by the prefect 
gentleman; the fubjedts are of various kinds, lcripture pieces, Dutch figures, 
landfcapes, fruit and flowers, and the tout enfemhle produces an admirable effedt.
The terrace runs from north to fouth in front of the houfe, palling which, it becomes 
of confiderable breadth, making a return to theeaft of fome length; from this ter- 
vol.

BROUGHAM-HALL.
race you have the following views, for variety as well as extent, fcarcely an}" 
where to be equalled, and however fhort of the appearance of nature a defcriptioa 
muft fall, the fcenery will be recognized by all who have at any time vifited the- 
place.
To the fou-th are feen the irregular banks of the river Lowther, which here 
and there are concealed by trees enriching the feene; at the diflance of two 
miles, are the extenlive woods of Lowther-Hall, which vie with any of fouth- 
ern growth, the manufactory houfe, where carpets are made* after the manner of 
Goblins, a large white building of feveral Rories, rifing amidft the wood, makes at 
that diftance a confpicuous objeCt, from this end of the terrace; nearer to the eye, 
you have the village of Clifton, the tower of Clifcon-Hall, the refidence anciently 
cf the family of the Wyberghs, and the high road from Penrith to Kendal.
To the weft you look down on a level of rich meadows wafhed by the river 
Lowther, and have a complete view of the bridge, the road to which from Lon- 
don to Penrith by Yorkfhire pafTes through the Grounds of Brougham; on the 
ether fide of this river, at a little diftance, you have in view the grove which 
encircles thedruidical remains of Maybrough, or Mayburgh, the centre ftone of 
â€¢which, eleven feet in height, and twenty-two in circumference, is an objeCl from 
hence.
This rclique will be more particularly treated of in our progrefs to Penrith.
In the more diftant view, you have the village of Yanwith, the Hall of Yanwith, 
an ancient tower, battlemented, belonging to Lord Lonfdale, the hills of Ulfwater, 
about five miles diftanr, and a variety of different objects, to the extent o( eighteen 
miles, where the whole is bounded by.
a chain of moll ftupendous mountains, 
beautifully diminiihed by their diftance, varying in ihape and lifting their heads 
to the clouds, with that irregular grandeur noticed by thofe who have poetically 
deferibed them in their vifits to the famous Lakes of Kefuick, from which thefe 
hills arife, the mountain called Saddleback being the lord of this group, which 
happily bounds the weft view on that great extent from the terrace.
To the north, the nearelt objed: is the village and river of Earnout, w-ith the 
bridge which feparates the counties of Weftmorland and Cumberland; the de- 
lightful grounds of Caileton-Hall form, as it may be faid, the right wing of this 
fcenery ; in the centre divifion you have the town of Penrith, the church and its 
tower, whilft the horizon is fhut in upon the left by the ruin of the ancient 
caftle; beyond the town of Penrith arifes the moor, acrofs which you diftinguifh 
the high road to Carlifie, the race ground on one fide, and on the fummit of the 
hill the beacon houfe, a ftone building of two ftories, with a flair from the 
lower to the upper one; this formerly was lighted up in times of danger, as a 
iignal of the approach of the enemy, and at prefent, though ufelefs as to its 
original purpofe, is feen around the country, and from hence in particular is a 
pleafing obelifk.
This place has an uncommon advantage from thefe varied landfcapes at each 
point of view, viz.
that the whole is taken in, (thelaft to the north only excepted) 
from every room in the houfe; and in addition to thefe profpeds of nature, is 
the conftant palfage of travellers on the two great roads from London.
* The private property of Lord Loafdale.
The 
BROUGHAM-HALL.
3Â°y 
The pleafure grounds ere extenfive, confiding of fnrubberies and woods; the 
former, the firft of the kind in this country, and at prefent of the greateft 
extent and variety, was planned by the late pofieflor, and executed under the 
eye of Mr. Edow, the chief gardener at Lowthcr-Hall ; this completely covers 
the high bank, of which the terrace forms the top, and extending a considerable 
way round, is on a much greater fcale than it appears to be at a diftance; walks 
are formed in every direction, and here and there, to obviate any inconvenience 
from the fteepnefs of the declivity, fieps are confiru&ed of turf.
In a recefs, well adapted to the purpofe, being near a fine Ipring, inclofed with 
done, over which is placed a bench with arms, you enter a hermitâ€™s cell, a circular 
thatched building, lined completely with mofs ol various kinds, the feats round 
it matted, and the windows, which are fmall, of painted glafs, the fubjedt of each, 
a faint ; in a niche are the ufual characderidics of a hermit in his retirement from 
the world, the hour glafs, crofs and beads, and the memento mori , a fkull, the whole 
fupported by a large tree in the centre, lopped for the purpofe, to the upper part 
of which the rafters are fixed for the thatching, the trunk in the infide of the cell 
being covered alfo with modes, and lamps hung round it for nightly contempla- 
tion; on the table is painted, from the Penferofo of Milton, 
â€œ And may at laft my weary age, 
â€œ Find out the peaceful hermitage, 
â€œ The hairy gown and moffy cell, 
â€œ Where I may fit and rightly fpell.
â€œ Of every liar that heaven doth (hew, 
â€œ And every herb that fips the dew ; 
â€œ Thefe pleafures melancholy give, 
â€œ And I with thee will chule to live.*' 
And in another part of the hermitage is fixed a fcroll, with thefe lines : â€” â€¢ 
â€œ Beneath thefe mofs-grown roots, this rullic cell, 
â€œ Truth, liberty, content, fequeftered dwell : 
â€œ Say you who dare our hermitage difdain, 
u What drawing-room can boaft fo fair a train ?â€ 
The wood adjoining, which is of feveral acres, is a continuance of the beauty of 
this place, and is alfo in character with the other parts of the fituation, fo much fo 
indeed, that in every reprefentation of it the painter has confidered it as a necef- 
fary member of the whole on his canvafs.
The form is the fegment of a circle, 
covering a bank which rifes gently from the meadows below, to a level with the 
terrace, and this circular form or flope gives it, when in foliage, an air of much 
grandeur ; it has been rendered ufeful as well as ornamental by the prefent 
owner, who has formed feveral new walks through the whole, from the top to the 
botrom, covered the old ones with gravel, and placed rufiic feats, of various 
forms, in the different parts.
When through this w'ood, we crofted the high road 
to Kendal from the north, pafiing through iron gates of a Gothic form, corre- 
sponding with the windows of the maniion-houfe, and entering a field railed 
off, and planted with fhrubs, were conducted by a winding walk to a 
thatched building upon the edge of the river Lowther, which confifts of two 
rooms, one an odtagon, finifhed with prints bordered and fixed on the wall, 
which is of a lemon colour, and various Ipecimens of natural hifiory, &c.
&c.
are

arranged on fh elves, the whole furniture of this place being in character as a 
cottage omee ; here is alfo a gallery or balcony, which is entered from the room, 
for the convenience of fifhing, the river running underneath it.
The other apart- 
ment is fmall, and occupied by a perfon who refides there for the purpofe of 
taking care of the poultry, &c.
The whole is encircled by a railing, and in the 
centre of the inclofure a venerable fpreading oak, furrounded by a feat compofed 
of branches, gives the finifh of rufticity to this delightful retreat; from hence you 
have at one view the molt advantageous profpedt of the hall, the fhi ubberries, 'and 
wood already deferibed.
The various objects of tafte difpofed on different points 
of view in the grounds of this place, to great advantage, as antiques, pedefhils

&c._ we do not enter into a particular detail of; but we have 
endeavoured to give our readers a more exaCt idea of this laft mentioned-retreat, 
and ot the hermitage alfo, as they are quite out or the common ftile, (indeed the

At the north end of this field, by the fide of which flows the river Lowther, is 
Lowther bridge before-mentioned, as viewed from the terrace, ot three arches, 
over which we paffed; and at the dlftance of about two hundred yards from the 
bridge foot, a little off the road fide, came to the ground where we viewed the 
circular trench called 
ARTHURâ€™S ROUND TABLE.
Camden and his editor mention this and the adjacent monuments of antiquity, thus: 
** A little before Lodore joins the Emot, it paffes by a large round intrenchmenr, 
Â« with a plain piece of ground in the middle, and a paffage into it on the other fide: 
Â« it goes by the name of King Arthurâ€™s Round Table, and it is poflible enough it 
Â« might be a jufting place.
However, that it never was defigned for a place of 
Â« ftrength, appears from the trenches being on the infide.
Near this is another 
Â«< great fort of ftones, heaped up in form of a horfe fhoe, and opening towards it ; 
Â« called, by fome, King Arthurâ€™s Caftle, and by others Maybrugh , or Maybrough.
" " Emot may be called the Ticinus of the two counties of Wcftmorland and 
" Cumberland, falling in a clear and rapid ft ream out of the Uifwatet, as the Teffin 
Â« does from the Lago Maggiore, and will yet be more remarkable, on account of 
Â«< this and the neighboui ing remains of antiquity upon its banks ; if we believe them 
Â« to be, as 1 think we may, monuments of that treaty of peace and union which was 
Â«Â« finifhed by King Athelftan, in the year 926, with Conftantine, King of Scots,

In an adjacent field, without Mr. Morganâ€™s garden, is the hollow circular fpot, known at Caerleon 
by the name of Arthurâ€™s Round T bis, which is generally fuppofed to be a Roman work, and to have 
ferved by way of amphitheatre In this cafe it mutt be confidered as one of the Cattrenfian kind, like 
that at Richborough cattle, not far from Sandwich in Kent, and many others.
Stukely f mentions one 
at Silchefter, and another three miles from Redruth in Cornwall.
Probably the round entrenchment be- 
tween Penrith and Sbap in Weflmorland, deferibed by Salmon, Â£ and compared by him to a cock-pit, or 
wreftling ring, is of the fame kind.
It alfo goes by the name of Arthurâ€™s Round Table, as does that 
on tire cattle wall at Wincheftcr.
Such temporary amphitheatres were probably the only ones ufed by the 
Romans in the dittant provinces; fince their more pompous edifices of this kind feem to have been con- 
fined to Italy, Fiance, Spain, the coafts of the Adriatic, and the neighbouring provinces of Helvetia, &c, 
Lipfius has given 11s a lilt of fuch of thefe fupeib buildingv-ct which there are any remains, in his learned 
book De amphitheatris extra Romam.
But it feems rather extraordinary, that in the preceding treatife 
De amphitheatro, where he particularly treats of the origin and nature of the Roman amphitheatres in 
general, he fliould entirely emit even to mention thofe of the Cattrenfian kind ; efpecially fince there is 
great rcafon to fuppofe that in their firft origin, other amphitheatres alfo refembled them.
For it is well 
known that the Romans originally ftood at games,* till luxury introduced fitting ; and it is obfervable 
that the Cattrenfian amphitheatres in general preferve no fignsof the fubfellia, or feats ; fo that the people 
mutt have ttood on the graffy declivity I faw no ftgns of feats in that of Caerleon, nor in the more 
perftâ€™ft one near Dorchetter, as Stukely $ has alfo obferved nor do I recollect that any fuch have been 
difeovered in any other Cattrenfian amphitheatre, in our lfland, where they feem to have been rather 
numerous.
For, confidering the fequency and importance of the Roman ftations with us, and the nature 
of luch amphitheatres, which arc eafily hidden or disfigured, it may reafonably be fuppofed, that there 
were many more of them in Britain than what are known to us at prefent, though the number of the latter 
is by no means incotifidcrable.
The learned author, whom I have juft quoted, rightly obferves, Si aedi- 
ficium aut publici operis ullum genus crebrum in Italia et provinciis fuit, reperies hoc fuiffe quod ad ludos 
fpeciat ; and further, audeo adfirmare, raram aliquam five coloniam five municipium fuiffe, m queis non 
ct ludi ifti ct ludorum fimul fedes.
It is alfo reafonable to imagine, that the firft ufe of feats was in thefe 
campeftral or turfy amphitheatres.
Ovid in his poetical rapfody de Arte Amandi, exprefsly fays, In 
gradifcus fedet populus de cefpite fa&is.
It is alfo further probable, that the appellation cavea, which 
was often applied to amphitheatres in general, || may have been originally derived from the fimple form of 
thefe primitive ones dig upon the turf.
Though the others of a fuperior ciafswere commonly fuperftruc- 
iuies built with brick, hewn ftone, or marble ; yet Liplius<j{ defcribes a very remarkable Roman amphi- 
theatre at Done, on the confines of the provinces of Anjou and Poitou in France, which is entirely formed 
from the folid rock of a mountain, excavated for that purpofe by an effort of human labour, worthy of the 
Romans.
It is very remarkable that fo Angular a monument of antiquity fliould never have been taken 
Eotice of before Dipfiusâ€™s time ; efpecially being fituated in fo civilized a country.
But it is time to quit 
this fubjeft : I (hall therefore only obferve further, that the amphitheatre nr Caerleon is placed without 
the walls of the camp, according to the cuftom of the Rom ns upon fuch occafions.

Some fuppofe this to have been defigned for tilting 
" matches, and that the champions entered at each opening.â€ 
This place is reprefented in the annexed plate : the trench by which it is formed, 
is near ten paces wide; the foil which has been thrown up outwardly, formingan 
outward banking like a theatre; the approaches are ten paces wide, and the whole 
circle within the ditch is one hundred and ftxty paces in circumference.
It feems 
mod reafonable to determine this was a tilting ground.
f its vicinity to Penrith makes 
it highly probable that fuch was its ufe; either allowing that Penrith, in its higheft 
antiquity, was a feat of royalty; or in more modern times, the place of relidence 
of the Duke of Gloucefter; whofe magnificent manner of living allows us no doubt, 
fuch fpeftacles and exhibitions would be ufed; for it was common in thofe days to 
celebrate grand feftivals with a tournament.
At a little diftance from the Round Table, and nearer to Lowther bridge, is 
another circular ditch, with a very low rampart, but of much larger dimenfions, 
being feventy paces diameter, without any apertures or advances.* 
The next place to be noticed is Maybrough; it lies about half a mile to the weft 
of Arthurâ€™s Table, confifts of an eminence which rifes gradually from the plain, 
for about one hundred and forty paces, forming the lower fedfion or bafe of a 
regular cone; the afeent is every where covered with wood, and the remains of 
timber trees of great fize appear on every fide.
The plate reprefents an interior 
view of part of the circle, and of the column which ftands near to the centre of the 
circus.
The fummit of the hill is fenced round, fave only an opening or entrance, twelve 
paces in width, to the eaft; the fence is fingular, being compofed of an immenfe 
quantity of loofe pebble ftones and flints, which perhaps were gathered from 
the adjoining rivers.
No kind of mortar appears to have been ufed in this work, 
the ftones lie uncemented, piled up to a ridge, near twenty paces wide at the bafe, 
and in height about twelve feet from the interior plain.
Here and there time has 
fcattered a few trees and fhrubs over the pebbles, but in other places they are loofe 
and naked both on the infide and outfide face of the fence.
The fpace within 
confifts of a fine plain of meadow ground, exa&ly circular, one hundred paces 
diameter; inclining a little to the weftwâ€™ard from the centre, a large column of 
unhewn ftone is handing ered:, (placed with the fmaller end in the earth) an afli tree 
grows at the bottom of the ftone ; it is twenty-two feet and fome inches in circum- 
ference near its middle, and is eleven feet and upwards in height.
The traditional 
account given of this place, is in no wife to be credited : â€œ That it was a Roman 
theatre, where men wereexpofed to combat with wild beafts; and that fuch ftones 
were placed for the refuge and refpite of the miferable fubjed in his unhappy 
conflict.â€ 
Mr. Pennant fays, â€œ There had been three more (ftones) placed fo as to form, 
â€œ with the other, a fquare.

*Â« remaining, all the others have long fince been blafted to clear the ground.
The 
* f ufe of this accumulation Teems to have been the fame with that called Bryn Gwytt , 
*â€¢ at ' lrer-Dryw, in Anglefea,* a fupreme confiflory of druidical adminiftration, as 
â€œ the Britifh names import.
That in Anglefea is conftruded in the fame manner 
* x with this ; but at prefent there are no remains of columnsin the interior part.â€f 
If to the generous reader it doth not appear arrogant, after quotations from 
fuch learned authors, we would offer fome thoughts on this place; which we 
prefume is as great a curiofityin its nature, as the Salkeld monument; and is the 
only one of its kind in the northern parts of Britain.
We prefumed to declare 
our opinion of the Salkeld monument, that it was the place of druidical judicature; 
that there the affembled delegates met in congrefs, and that the criminals fuifered 
execution there.
We conceive that Maybrough was appropriated folely to reli- 
gious rites, and that here the pupils received 1 their documents in the myfteries of 
that religion.
Its limilitude with that in Anglefea confirms this opinion; and 
that Maybrough was the place (for the northern regions) of the fupreme con- 
fiflory in religious matters: it was calculated for ftudy and contemplation : it was 
lhut in bv a folemn grove, and perhaps in its original date, was fenced about 
with a lower and outward wall, to fee bounds to the vulgar.

Further to illuftrate the difference infilled upon between this monument and Long Meg, we beg leave 
to add the following notes to what has been already advanced on that fubjedt.
â€œ Paufanias fpeaks of a temple at S icy on,, built by /I dr aft us, (Lib. 2.) who lived an age before the 
Trojan war ; which confided of columns only, without wall or roof, like the Celtic temples of our northern 
anceftors, or the Pvrsetheia of the Perfians, which were circles of ftones, in the centre of which was 
kindled facred fiie ; (Strab.
Lib. 15.) the fymbol of the Deity.
Horn r frequently fpeaks of places of 
worfhip confuting of an area and altar only (npivos Qvpcs ts ) which were probably inclofures like thefe of 
the Perfians, with an altar in the centre.
Ibid.

The Orphic Temples were, without doubt, emblems of that fundamental principle of the myftic faith 
of the ancients, the folar fyftem; fire the effence of the Deity, occupying the place of the fun, and the 
columns furrounding it, as the fubordinate parts of the univerfe.
Ibid.
1 12.
From a patTage of Hecaixus preferved by Diodorus Siculus, (Lib. 2.
) we think it is evident that Stone- 
henge, and all the other monuments of the fame kind found in the north, originally belonged to that o-e- 
neral religion, which appears at fome remote period, to have prevailed over the whole northern hemifphere.
According to that ancient hiftorian, the Hyperboreans inhabited an if and beyond Gaul, as large as Sicily, 
in nuhich Apollo 'was worjhipped in a circular temple, confiderable for its fize and riches.
Apollo, we know,, 
in the lan uage of the Greeks of that age, can mean 110 other than the fun, which, according to Csefar 
(de B.
Gal. Lib.
6.) was worihipped by the Germans, when they knew of no other deities, except fire 
and the moon.
The ifland here alluded to, can, we think, be no other than Britain, which at that time 
was only known to the Greeks, by the vague reports of Phoenician mariners, fo uncertain and obfeure, 
that Herodotus the mod inquifitive and credulous of HUlorians, doubts of its exiftencc.

All 
we can gather from the name of Maybrough, leads us not far in antiquity, but yet 
in fome meafure confirms our pofitions : for if we conceive this to be a corruption 
of Mayberie, or Maleberge, we find authors of great note defining them thus : Lord 
Coke fays, " Berie is the name of a plain or vale, furrounded with groves and 
Â«Â« forefts, and held facred by the ancient Britons,â€ fo that probably the name 
came ot Magi -barie, or the facred plain of the magi , or wife men.
Du Cange tells 
us that â€œ Maleberge lignifies Mons placiti : a hill where the people afiembled at a 
â€œ court like our affizes, which by the Scotch and Iriffi are called Parley-hills ." â€” 
To thefe we will add Spelmanâ€™s conftrudtion : â€” â€œ Collis valla plerumq.

PENRITH.
W E now re-enter Cumberland by Eamont Bridge, which is one mile from 
this place.
Penrith is a fmall marker town, lying on an eafy inclination 
of the ground: it chiefly confifts of one long llreet, flrerchmg north and fouth.
â€” 
The market-place is fmall, and much encumbered by very ugly fhambles, cover- 
ed with dates.
An open fpace or area, leading to the caftle, is btft calculated for 
the market; but, tenacious of cuftom, though inconvenient, it is held in the 
ancient place.
There are many modern, well-built houfts, in a good tafte here; 
and the inhabitants are wealthy, courteous, and well-bred.* 
Various opinions have been given, as to the etymology of the name of Penrith : f 
Bifhop Gibfonâ€™s edition of Camden has it, â€œ Penrith, in Britifh, a red bill or head- 
*â€¢ for the ground thereabouts, and the ftone of which it is built, are both reddifh: 
â€œ [this, according to Dr. Gale, is the Veroda of Antoninusl it is a noted little 
Â«Â« market town.â€ And though this etymology differs from that given in the 
Latin edition, and quoted in the notes, we are inclined to adopt it.
The hill im- 
mediately above the town, which is a very confpicuous land-mark, to be feen at 
a great diftance, is adtuallv, to this day, a red hil!.
Dr. Todd would derive it 
from the Petriava of the Romans, a ffation diftant from the town about three 
miles, in Plumpton Park, where the fEla Petriana lay in garrifon ; out of whofe 
ruins, he fays, the town was built.
But it is not very probable, that they fliould 
bring materials from thence, even (tones ready fquared, when they could eafily have 
them immediately at hand.
Penrith lies within the foreft of Inglewmod, on its fouthern extremity,- and 
is bounded by Barton, Dacre, Newton, ITefket, Lazonby, Salkeld, Edenhall, and 
Brougham.
It is an honour or paramount manor of the Duke of Devonfhireâ€™s, 
by purchafe from the Duke of Portland, once a royal franchife, and from thence 
endowed with extenfive and peculiar privileges.
In confequence of the feveral 
changes this part of the country underwent, during the long and various debates 
between the two crowns, Penrith has experienced a variety of fortunes.
Long 
before the conqueff, it is noticed as a place of chief confequence in the county.
In the introduction, we have fketched out, from that dark acra of hiftory which 
preceded the Norman acceffion, the poffeifions of the Britons, and their long and 
bloody ccndidts.

[Leath Ward.
At the time of the Norman conqueR, Penrith was in the poflefllon of the Scots, 
who claimed it, together with Weftmorland, Northumberland, and part of Rich- 
mondfhire, as fiefs of Scotland.
â€” William difpofiefled them of Cumberland, 
though they Rill perfiRed to alledge the jufiice of their claim.
â€” King John con- 
fented to cede to William, King of Scotland, thofe feveral territories, on receipt 
of 15,000 merks : and he alfo covenanted, that Henry, or Richard, his fons, fhould 
marry Margaret, or Ifabelia, the Scots Kingâ€™s daughters: but neither marriage 
took effeift.
â€” The claim was alfo agitated between King Henry III.
and Alexan- 
der, King of Scotland, and was compromifed by the popeâ€™s nuncio; when Henry 
agreed to grant to Alexander, two hundred librates of land in the counties of 
Northumberland and Cumberland, if the fame could be found in any of the town- 
fhips where no cafile Rood : if not, the deficiency was to be made up in parts 
adjacent to the faid counties.
The fame was to be held of the crown of England, 
on the yearly payment of a foar hawk at Carlifle, to the conRable of the caflle there.
This agreement was fo lingular, that the following extracts from it, cannot, we 
truR, be deemed either impertinent in this place, or in itfelf incurious.* 
Nicholas Farnham, then Bilhop of Durham, as nominee of King Henry, in the 
year 1244, afligned the manors of Penrith and Sowerby to the king of Scotland, 
in confequence of the noted agreement.
Alexander dying in the year 12.51, was fucceeded by his fon, Alexander the 
Third, who efpoufed Margaret, King Henryâ€™s daughter, and received confirma- 
tion of the above lands; w hich occalioned them to be called the Queenâ€™s Hainis , 
or demefnes.
By an afiize taken in the fixth year of the reign of King Edward I.
it is Rated, 
that the King of Scotland held Penrith, Longw'aldeofby, Scotby, Salkeld-magna, 
and Carleton : and by an inquilition poR mortem, taken 2 1 It King Edward I.
1292, on the demife of Alexander, King of Scotland, it appears he was feized of 
the fame at his death, worth yearly 200I.
and that John Baliol, then thirty years 
of age, w r as the next to inherit.
On Baliolâ€™s fuing for livery of the Cumberland lands, as heir of Alexander, it 
was found, Penrith and Sowerby was granted to Alexander and his heirs.
Kings 
of Scotland, and not generally to his heirs only: therefore not till after Baliolâ€™s 
accefiion to the crown, had he livery of this place, with its lands and ap- 
purtenances.

tants were carried into captivity.
This, it is faid, was an attack made on the 
Englifli territories, at the infligation of the French King.
Sir William Douglas 
had the chief command upon this expedition ; and, with unremitting feverity, 
wafted the greateft part of Cumberland.
The Englifli, commanded by the Bifliop 
of Carlifle, Sir Thomas Lucy, and Sir Robert Ogle, not being in force to oppofe 
them, formed an army of obfervation, which ferved greatly to check their depre- 
dations.
A detached party of the Scots, under the command of Sir Alexander 
Strachan, w ho were out foraging, w T ere cut 01F; and Sir Alexander w'as run through 
the body.
Sir Robert Ogle was alfo grievoufly wounded in the conflict.
The 
bifliop fignalized himfelf, and had a narrow efcape ; he w as difmounted, and in 
great danger of being made prifoner.
In the thirtieth year of the fame reign, the inhabitants, in their petition to the 
crown, fet forth an account of their calamities, that the lands and tenements 
which they held under a heavy rent fjom the crown, were wafted by the Scots: 
anil that their corn w-as often deftroyed by the beafts of the foreft ; in confequence 
of which remonftrance, the king granted to them and their heirs, common of 
pafture for all their cattle within the whole foreft, in as ample a manner as the 
prior of Carlifle and other tenants had by grant of the king.f

PENRITH.
[Leath Ward.
During the civil diflentions between King Richard II.
and his parliament, the 
Scotch troops entered England in two divifions, the fmaller by the Eaft March, 
whole retreat was rendered famous by the battle of Otterburn ; the larger divifion 
entered by the Weft March, and made their progrefs as far as Penrith, which 
they plundered and facked, but fpared the inhabitants from captivity.^ In con- 
fideration of which calamity.
King Richard II.
in the eleventh year of his reign, 
confirmed the grant made to the tenants of Penrith by his grandfather.
Penrith, from the time of John Baliolâ€™s defection, continued a royal demefne, 
until the 19th year of the reign of King Richard II.
when, by a grant from the 
crown, this manor and Sowerby were given to John, Duke of Bretaign, and Earl 
of Richmond : but how long he poffefled the fame, or for what caufe fuch grant 
was refeinded, we are not informed ; but it was not long before letters patent were 
granted thereof, to Ra. de Nevill, Earl of Weilmorland, and Johanna his wife.
Some authors have aflerted, that Richard de Nevill, Earl of Warwick, the heir of 
Ralph, being {lain in the battle of Barnet, in the eleventh year of the reign of King 
Edward IV.
this eftate, by extinction of male iffue of the grantee, reverted to the 
crown.
But we are rather inclined to coincide with Mr. Pennantâ€™s opinion, that 
the feigniory of Penrith was part of the great eftate, which King Richard III.
whilft Duke of Gloucefter, had in marriage with his Dutchefs.
For this opinion 
Mr. Pennant quotes Buckâ€™s life of King Richard Ill.f] 
Penrith continued to be a royal demefne, until granted by King William III.
to 
William Bentinck, afterwards by him created Duke of Portland ; in whofe noble 
defeendant it remained until the year 1783, when he fold all his Cumberland 
pofTefiions to the Duke of Devonfhire.
Elaving taken a curfory view of the moft material parts of the ancient hiftory 
of Penrith, we will now give the belt account we can of iis prefent ftate.
In the view from Beacon-hill, is -comprehended the fine fertile vale, in 
which Penrith Hands, confiding of as rich meadows, as any in the north of 
England.
But the cultivated trad: being narrow, is chiefly occupied for the ufe 
of the inhabitants of this town Advancing northward two miles down the valley, 
the lands are much inferior in quality.
X In the 6th year of King Richard II.
tfie Scots pafied through the foreil of Inglewood and entered 
Penrith at the time of the fair ; where they made much bloodlhed and pillaged the town.
But with the 
merchandize, it is fuppofed, they carried the peftiience into their country, by which one third of the 
people died The Englifh, to retaliate, pafTed over Solway Frith, and took great booty, but in return 
fell into a dcfde, where four hundred were dain ; and many in their precipitate flight were drowned.

The Old Castle, of which fome noble remains are Hill Handing, overlooks 
the town from the weft, and gives it a majeftic appearance.
In Bifnop Gibfonâ€™s 
edition of Camden, the defcription is, â€œ Fortified on the weft with a royal caftle, 
â€œ which, in the reign of King Henry VI.
was repaired out of the ruins of May burgh , 
" a jJaniJb temple hard by.â€ By a marginal note, it is obferved, that as to the 
time of luch repairs, â€œ it is a millake,â€ and the place which furnifned the ma- 
terials is called â€œ a Roman fort.â€ But this, we doubt not, will appear in the 
fequel to be a complicated error; there are no marks of Roman workmanlhip to 
be difcovered on any of the ftones in the caftle, to fuppori a ccniecfturc, that the 
ftones for erecling this building were ftripped from old Penrith, the fort Petriana 
of the Romans.
The caftle Hands on a natural eminence, of no great elevation.
It is formed on a parallelogram, fortified with a rampier and a very deep outward 
folic, or ditch : the only approach was on the fide next to the town, where an 
opening through the works Hill appears ; which, it is prefumed, was kept by a 
draw bridge.
There is a confiderable platform between the walls and the ditch.
The eredion is of a red freeftone, with w hich the country abounds ; it has nothing 
antique in its members or ornaments ; the form of the windows and other parts 
doth not dilcover any thing to carry our idea much beyond the time of King 
Edward V.
But we confefs there is little left from whence we might determine 
the age of the building, with any degree of precifion.
It is evident, from the 
hiftorical circumftances, that in the reigns of King John and King Henry III.
rhere was no caftle here.
When thefe demefnes were feized by King Edward III.
and afterwards granted to Anthony Beck, no fuch fortrefs is named ; and had fuch 
cxifted at the time of the Scotch incurftohs, before related, the depredations would 
have been checked, or the inhabitants would have had a place of refuge.
In the 
latter end of the fourteenth century, after the grant was made to the Duke of 
Britany, perhaps this fortrefs might arife; and this is the earlieft aera, in which we 
conceive there is any probability of dating its foundation.
From our own opi- 
nions, we are inclined to Hate its rife, after Penrith was granted to Nevill; and 
that it was firft erebted by that family ; but be that as it may, it is the general opinion, 
that Richard, Duke of Gloucefter, refided here, that he might be more at hand 
to oppofe the Scots, w'ho w ere inceftantly turbulent : but the moft probable caufe 
of fuch refidence, was to keep the adjacent country in awe, the inhabitants being 
chiefly attached to the Lancaftrian party : Mr. Pennant fays, â€œ By his refidence 
" here, and his magnificent mode of living, he gained great popularity in the north, 
" and he feemed to depend greatly on the troops from that part: for he caufed five 
â€œ thoufand to march from thence to London to fupport his coronation.â€ To 
which we may reafonably add, the vaft influence of the Nevills, in the northern 
counties.
Whilft the Duke w as here, if he was not the original builder, he certainly 
added feveral works to the cafiie, conftruded forne new r towers, and greatly 
llrengthcned the whole fortrefs.
The report of the materials being taken from an 
old ruin at May trough, is without the leaft probability; for the fouth and eaft 
fronts are of afhler w ork, well jointed, and of excellent rnafonry; and there is not 
the leaft appearance of hewn Hone, or a quarry of freeftone, in or near May trough.
If the tradition of this caflleâ€™s being ereefted out of the ruins of any old building, 
has 
PENRITH.
[Leath Ward, 
has any foundation, it may have arifen from its being built of afhler-bones of the 
rampier of a Roman fort, which, probably, flood on the very fpot : the ground on 
which the cable bands having the brongeb marks of an ancient camp, of fquare 
figuie, an outward fobe and agger, with an inward walled rampier, of which the 
dibind remains are now to be feen.
Its contiguity to Petriana and Brovoniacum 
indeed argue powerfully againb thepohtion, but it is not pobible othcrwifc to re- 
concile the tradition with the prefent circumbances.
Penrith cable, with the 
honour or paramount dominion, continued from the time of King Richard III.

many other royal fortreffes, in the time of King Charles I.
this place w'as fcized by 
the rapacious adherents of the commonwealth, difmantled, its chief llrength thrown 
down, and the lead, timber, and other materials fold by the fpoilers.
There are 
fome large vaults laid open, w'hich are faid to be the ancient pri foils ; and the chief 
Angularities in the prefent remains, are the projecting corbies in the eab front, 
which have lupported open galleries : there are few ornaments about the whole 
building.* 
In Gibfonâ€™s edition of Camden, it is faid, u Penrith has a large market-place, 
<( with a town-houfe of wood, for the convenience of the market people; which 
â€œ is beautified with bears climbing up a ragged baff, the device of the Earls of 
" Warwick.â€ This town-houfe, fome few years ago, W'as occupied by a fet of 
players, and, by fome accident, burnt to the ground ; which event has opened out 
and rendered more airy feveral very good houfes : it was a fortunate accident to 
the town in general, as it was thereby deprived of an ugly obbruClion and a 
nuifance, as all fhambles and town-halls erected in this Scotch mode almoft 
always are.
The botanical paintings executed by the late Mifs Calvin,!
a native of Penrith,

Culture ] Hufbandry is improved of late years â€” the arable lands lie fheltered, and the cultivation 
of turnips is brought to great perfedlion; but the prefent high rents, and the great demand for grafs lands, 
have caui'ed the farmer to pay more attention thereto, than to plowing.

This information 
aftonifhed me : I inquired the produce of fuch land, and found it reckoned as good, upon the whole, as 
other foils managed upon more modern principles ; five or fix for one of oats ; and when wheat happens 
to be fown, ten or eleven for one.
Fallowing is a new fafnion, and not perfectly relifned by the farmers 
yet.
â€œ In a common way, they generally plough for wheat from three to fix times, fow two bufhels about 
Michaelmas, and gain, upon an average, about three quarters.
For barley, they plough from once to 
thrice, few two bufhels and a half in April or May, and gain about 25.
Sometimes barley' is fown on.

They give but one ftirring for oats, fow four bufhels 
before barley fowing, and get 28 in return.
For peafe, they give but one earth, fow two bufhels, and 
get in return about 16; generally ufe the grey rouncivals.
They give from thiee to five plowings for 
rye, fow two bufhels, the crop about 24.
â€œ For turnips, they give three or four earths, never boe, and reckon the average value, per acre, at 50s.
ufe them for fheep and fatting of beads.
Clover, they fow with either barley or oats, generally mow it 
once, (three times have been known) and get two tons of hay per mowing.
Â« They prepare for potatoes by ploughing twice or thrice, dung the land with long horfe dung ; lay 
the fets in every other furrow, ten inches afunder, and hand-hoe between them ; if weedy, fometimes they 
horfe-hoe them : if the land is deligned for wheat, they lime it about midfummer, while the potatoes

â€œ fide of the church, are erefled two large pillars, of about four yards in height 
Â« each, and about five yards diftanr one from the other: it is faid that they were

" of great ftrength and ftature, who lived in thefe parts and killed wild boars in the 
â€œ foreft of Inglewood, which much infefted the country ; he was buried here, they 
â€œ fay, and was of fuch a prodigious ftature, as to reach from one pillar to the

â€œ eredted two on each fide of the grave, between the pillars, are in memory of his 
â€œ great exploits upon thefe creatures.

Mr. Pennant thus fpeaks of them : " In the church-yard is a monument of 
Â« great antiquity, conlifting of two ftone pillars, eleven feet fix inches high, and 
â€œ five in circumference in the lower part, which is rounded, the upper is fquare 
" and tapers to a point ; in the fquare part is fome fret-work, and the relievo of 
â€œ a crofs ; and on the interior lide of one, is the faint reprefentation of fome

Both thefe ftones are mortized at their lower part into a round one: 
â€œ they are about fifteen feet afunder; the fpace between them is inclofcd on each 
Â« f fide with two very large, but thin femicircular ftones ; fo that there is left a 
,f walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in breadth.

In the ten years preceding the peftiknee, there were only 686 funerals ; 
â€œ fo that there was no great difference between the number of inhabitants at that and the prefent time.
â€œ Some centuries previous to this, Penrith had another vifitation of the fame nature.
When the Scots, 
â€œ under the Earl of Douglas, in 1380, made an inroad into Cumberland, they furprifed this place at the 
â€œ time of a fair, and returned with immenfe booty ; but fuffered feverely in confequence, for they intro- 
â€œ duced into their country the plague contradled in this town, which fwept away one third of tire inha-

â€œ Thefe Rones Teem to have been monumental, and are evidently ChriRian, as 
Â« appears by the crofs on the capital : fable fays, that they were to.
perpetuate the 
" memory of Crefarius; a hero of gigantic ftature, whofe body extended from Rone 
â€œ to Rone; but it is probable, that the fpace marked by thefe columns contained 
Â« feveral bodies, or might have been a family lepulchre.
I muR here obferve that 
" fince the publication of the former editions of this book, I have had oppor- 
Â« tunity of re-examining thefe Rones, and comparing them with Dr. Toddâ€™s 
<c figures engraven in my 13th plate, and am convinced that they are entirely 
â€œ fictitious ; and fuch is the opinion of fome gentlemen of the place, whom I 
" confulted on the occafion.
â€œ Not far from thefe pillars is another called the Giantâ€™s Thumb, five feet eight 
" inches high, with an expanded head, perforated on both fides ; from the middle, 
â€œ the Rone rifes again into a leffer head, rounded at top, but no part has a ten- 
Â« dency to the figure of a crofs, being in no part mutilated ; fo that it is difficult 
" to judge the ufe or defign of this pillar.â€ 
In the Archseologia we find the following account of this monument, with the 
remarks of Mr. Gough, the director of the Society of Antiquaries.
â€œ In a tour I made the lafi fummer, over part of the north of England, I met 
â€œ with a remarkable monument in Penrith church-yard, in Cumberland, an ele- 
*Â« vation of which I now do myfelf the pleafure ot laying before you, it having 
â€œ never been yet engraver!, or intleed accurately defenbed by any author.
It is 
â€œ called the Giantâ€™s Grave ; and we have an account of it in Biffiop Gibfonâ€™s 
â€œ edition of the Britannia communicated to him (as 1 am informed,) by Dr..
â€œ Todd, of Carlifie.
â€œ This idle tale, which I found univerfally credited by the vulgar inhabitants 
Â« of Penrith , feems to have no other foundation, than the unufual length of the 
â€œ grave, and fome very rude carving on the front of thefe ftones, which in the 
Â« foregoing account are deferibed as figures of boars, and erected two on each 
â€œ fide of the grave.; whereas they are circular fegments of Rone about four feet in 
Â« height, and fix in length, enclofing a narrower fpace of ground than is ufually 
<t taken up by a common grave.
So iar therefore are thofe Rones from reprefent- 
Â« ing the figure of a boar, that it requires a pretty Rrong imagination to difeover 
w any regular figure in the rude fculpture w hich remains upon them.* In the 
â€œ fame 
* â€œ Mr. Pennant, at the end of his tour through Scotland, has published an account of thefe pillars, 
Â« with two views of them.
The oldeft of Mr Pennantâ€™s drawings makes their (hafts fquare, with tranf- 
K vev f e pieces, forming a perfed crofs, and a human head carved on the infide jull below the centre of 
Â« the crofs.
Not the leaft traces of the head at prefent, and fcarce any ot the tranfverfes : but though 
Â« they may have been deftroyed by time, it is not conceiveable that any man fince that time, as Mr.
Â« Pennant obferves, would have taken the pains to chip thefe pillars horn a round fhape, to one hair 
â€œ round, half fquare.
The greateft difficulty feems to be about the boars, fail) to be carved on rhe four 
u femicircular (tones below.
From Dr. Toddâ€™s den ip ion, one would fuppofe lie meant that thefe 
â€œ ftones were cut in the form of boars, inftead of being charged with relit .
a of thofe animals.

Â« W oru* as cited by Mr. Pennant, from his tvIS.

â€œ fame church-yard, at about thirteen yards diftance from this monument, is a 
{< Tingle pillar, called the Giant's 'Thumb, which Dr. Todd does not even mention in 
,f the above defeription.
But it is reprefenred in the drawing now before you.
" What relation or connexion this pillar has with the others, called the Giantâ€™s 
<f Grave, I will not pretend to determine; but from the lhape of the upper part, 
â€ I cannot think it to be the epiflile of an ancient ci ofs, as has been conjectured by 
â€œ fome learned perfons in that neigbourhood.f Whatever therefore this pillar 
â€œ may be, the Giantâ€™s Grave is undoubtedly a fepulchral monument ; but whether 
u Britifn, Roman, Saxon, or Danifh, is the queftion.
â€œ That it is much too rude to be a work of the Romans, is evident ; and with 
t( regard to the Saxons, i know of no monument of this kind remaining in England, 
â€œ which was ever attributed to thofe people.
It mull then be either Britifh or 
â€œ Danifh: now the Britons, it is well known, maintained their ground in thefe 
" parts, for a conhJerablc time, after the Saxons were in poflcflion of the red of 
â€œ England, and ga\e Britifh names boih to this county, and the place where this 
" monument hands.
The circular intrenchments, called Arthurâ€™s Round Table,* 
â€œ not unlike thofe on the Danifh obelilks in Scotland prefented themfelves to my imagination, on the 
â€œ outer face of the northweft itone, particularly two figures like men at the bottom.
The inner face of 
â€œ ail thefe flows is hatched with a chiffel, as is common in hewn ftones.
They have loft much of the 
â€œ neatnei's given them in this plate, and the fouth weftern ftone is almoft broken away.
They all origi- 
â€œ nally meafured two feet in height, but were of different lengths.
Dr. Todd fuppofes, the pillars were 
â€œ intended to place corpfes on, at the north or deathâ€™s door of the church, while prayers were offered 
â€œ for their fouls.
But the height of thefe pillars is againft this fuppofttion, even if we were fure of this 
â€œ ceremony orcuftom.
The name of grave given to this monument by uniform tradition, plainly afftgns 
â€œ its intention, though it may not be eafy to trace the perfon buiied under it.
The diftance of the ftones 
â€œ only proves him to have been a perfon of eminence and diftiwftion, as barrows are well known to exceed 
â€œ the pioportions of the bodies depofited under them.
Perhaps this grave might contain feveral bodies, 
â€œ and be a memorial of fome battle loft in the darknefs of hiftory.â€ â€” R.
Gough.
f The Giantâ€™s Thumb, a iingle ftone, at the northweft end of the church-yard, has nothing to do 
â€œ with the other monument, but is plainly an ancient crofs, whofe bafe is funk into the earth.
It is fix 
â€œ feet high, fourteen inches broad at bottom, contrafting to ten inches upwards, and the circle of the 
â€œ crofs eighteen inches in diameter.
A ciofs of one ftone, feven feet high, fomewhat like it, ftands on 
â€œ fteps in Longtown churchyard,* in this county.
Penrith church has , within thefe few years, been in- 
â€œ tirely rebuilt of brick , f except the tower which is of ftone.
The Giantâ€™s Grave, being very near the 
â€œ church, may have been damaged at this time by the workmen.
Ibid.
* â€œ This earth work is 150 feet in diameter, with two entrances on the north and fouth ; il has fuffereci 
a little by being ufed as a cock-pit : and the other earth work, which is contiguous to it on the north, 
â€œ is almoft defaced by building.â€ Ibid.
* He muft mean the church of Artnurct, in which parifh Longtown is ; but the crofs there has no fimilitude tc thofe 
in many church yards ; alfo in villages, and on the tops of feveral hills in this county, there are crofles.
The Editors.
f It is not without extreme reludlancc, we can bring outfelves to point out the inaccuracies of fo diftinguilhed a writer 
as Mr. Gough : but, for the fake of the very refpedlabie work (the Archreologia) in which thefe inaccuracies have found 
a place, we muft notice them.
There is, at lealt, confufion and obfturity in his fpeaking of the upright pillars as half 
ro\rd and half fquare.
That all the ftones are not hatched with a chjfel , is proved by one of them being a natural pebble.
Penrith church, he fays, is built of brick, all but the tower.
He might juft as well have faid that St. Paulâ€™s is built of brick.
Mr. Gough is pleaft d to fpcak contempt uoufiy of the â– vulgar inhabitants of Penrith.
That, ill any confiderable town, 
there ftiould be many ignorant and vulgar perfons, is not at all extraordinary.
It has, however, never appeared to us, 
who cannot but know Penrith, and the people of Penrith, that they were remarkable for either ignorance or vulgarity.
We know, and arc bold to aflert, that they arc much the contrary.
Little as they or we do really know of the piece of 
antiquity in queftion, it may fafely be averred, that there are hundreds in the town, who could have given Mr. Gough, 
at lcaft as good an account of it, as he has given the public.

â€œ about half a mile fouth of Penrith, defcribed in Gibbonâ€™s edition of the Britannia; 
â€œ and a large ftone circle, with a barrow in the centre, f about the like diftance 
â€œ north of Penrith, another called Long Meg and her Daughters, are all, or at leaft, 
*' the two laft, undoubted remains of the Britons here ; but if our monument be 
â€œ Britifh, it is of much later date, than either the ftone circle, or druid temple, 
â€œ being probably eredied to the memory of fome Britifh prince or chief, after 
â€œ Chriftianity was efuablifhed amongft them : and this I infer, from its being fitu- 
â€œ ated in the church-yard, and from the rude reprefentarion of a crofs, which 
tf appears towards the fummit cf one of the pillars its being denominated the 
<f Giantâ€™s Grave, is perhaps a circumflance which (Lengthens the opinion of the 
< s monument being Britifh ; for our beft writers on antiquity have obferved, that 
Â« both in England and Ireland, the vulgar afcribe every fiupendous and very an- 
Â« f cient w r ork of their Britifh anceflors to giants; thus Stonehenge is called Chorea 
â€œ Gigantum, or the Giantâ€™s Dance, by the old monkifli writers.
The vaft 
Â« fortification called Pen-y-gair Llanderfell, in Merioncthfhire, is faid by the 
neighbouring inhabitants to have been made by giants; and the like fabulous 
Â« tradition occurs in many other places.
But after all, this monument may per- 
Â« haps be Danifh, as the late learned Bifhop Nicolfon has proved that to be in 
ef Beaucaflle church-yard, in this county, as is the (tone crofs in Eyam church-yard, 
Â« in the county of Derby, which I formerly gave an account of to this learned 
Â« fociety.
Dr. Plot, in his natural hiftory of Stafford fit ire, has given an engrav- 
tc ing of a remarkable fepulchral monument of this kind at Checkly, in that county, 
Â« confiding of three upright pillars, about four feet high, (if I miftake not) two 
â€œT>f which have a good deal of rude fculpture upon them, as the third probably 
â€œ had ; but I was informed leveral years fince, by an ancient inhabitant of the 
Â« place, that the prefent plain pillar was placed there, in the room of one of the old 
ones, thrown down and broke by accident: the Dr. conjectures, that this rno- 
Â« nument was ereded by the Danes, from its fimilitude to that at Beaucaflle, in 
Â«< Cumberland, before-mentioned ; and to many of the like fort, defcribed by Olaus 
â€œ Wormius, in his fifth and fixth books of the Monumenta Danica.
But I mult

<f enough, yet it is much lefs fo, than the monument under confideration.â€

Such is the confeffediy great obfeurity of the fubject, on which fo much has 
already been faid, by perfons of the higeft eminence in the literary world, that 
little "remains for us to add; nothing indeed, but to acknowledge our ignorance.
Yet, as the matter is fti 1 1 open to inveftigation and difeuflion, we too, in our turn, 
beg leave to fubmit to the candour of the public, the very little that occurs to us 
onÂ°the fubjecl.
The pillars are of one entire Rone, each ; formed like the ancient 
1'pears ; the fhafts are round for about feven feet high, above which they run into 
a fquare, and appear to have terminated in a point ; where the fquare part com- 
mences, there are the remains of a narrow belt of ornamental fret work.
The 
remains of croffes raifed near the points of the pillars faintiy appear, and fomething 
like

like a wolf or a dog, may be difeovered on one of them.
The flones are fo much 
injured by time, that it is not poflible to afeertain, whether the fquares of thefe 
pillars were ornamented with other fculptures than what are mentioned : the moil 
remarkable thing is, that the ftone is not of a fimilar nature to any ufed in the ad- 
jacent buildings, or any quarry of ftone in the neighbourhood of Penrith, being; 
white and of a very open grit.
Three of the fide ftones have been figured with a 
fcrawl or running ornament of foliage, &c.
and the fourth, which feems to have 
been placed to fupply one decayed, is a natural pebble; they are rounded at the 
upper edge, in the feCtion of a circle, and are about twenty inches above the earth, 
in the higheft part : the other three are of red ftone, with which this country 
abounds.
Thus much, we think, we cannot but allow to the tradition, which is of the rc- 
moteft antiquity, that this was the tomb of fome eminent perfonage.
f It was much 
the fafhion with our anceftors in diftant ages, to exprefs their ideas by fymbols 
and allegories; and in particular to perfonate characters by fuch animals as men 
of note wore in their coat of armour.
We fee nothing, then, improbable in the fup- 
pofition, that the perfor.age here interred, had had, in his day, many conflicts on 
the borders, (and in the foreft of Inglewood in particular,) with fome of his war- 
like neighbours, who were perpetually making incurfions, either predatory or hof- 
tile, into Cumberland: whether he was a king or a baron, is immaterial to our 
argument.
The title of King of Cumberland, was not extinCt till the beginning 
of the tenth century.
The cuftoms and manners of the Romans, were not then 
all forgotten ; and w'e know, that the Romans ufed to diftinguifh their victories 
over the Scotch, in their fculptures and monuments, by the figure of a boar.
This 
figure might be retained, for feveral centuries backwards ; and might be employed 
in this inftan.ee, to point out, that the valour of the hero here interred, had been 
fignalized by his vi<ftories over that people; whom it was ft ill the fafhion to repre- 
lent under the figure of a Caledonian boar.
That Penrith is of great antiquity,, 
admits of no doubt : this is fufficiently proved by the various unqueftionably ancient 
monuments Hill in exiftence, in its neighbourhood.
Perhaps, (for we are left en- 
tirely to conjeClure,) it was the place of royal refidence.
Ewaine or (as fome 
authors w rite it) Owen , king of Cumberland, was a party in the congrefs held at 
Dacre and Maybrcugb, when Conjlanline of Scotland, the reigning prince of Wales, 
and he, did homage to Atheljlan ; and entered into a league with him, to hold their 
kingdoms by fealty under his protection.
Tradition calls this fuppofed giant, 
Ewan Cefaritts.
The former of thefe names is Britifh ; but the other Roman ; 
and might be given to this Ewan , in its true and primary fenfe, not as a name, 
but as a title of office; as declaratory of his fovereignty.
It can hardly be fup- 
pofed, that fuch names were hit upon by accident; and they are not fuch, as an 
inventor of fiction would have thought of.
The name of a large fortrefs, not far 
from Penrith, which we final 1 treat of hereafter, called Cafile-Ewaine , counte- 
nances the idea, that a perfon of great note of this name, whether a Czar or a 
baron, refided in the neighbourhood ; and if he lived here, here too he might die,

and here be buried ; and the ftones in queftion be his tomb, as tradition fays they 
were.
Perhaps too (to go on with our conjectures) he might be a remarkably 
tall man ; for tallnefs was confidered by the ancients as almoft a fine qua non in the 
formation of an hero : perhaps he might be even feven feet high; and the upright 
fhaft rounded to that height, to denote the human body, and thereby record that 
eircumftance : perhaps too he had actually killed four real boars in the adjacent 
foreft, of the fize expreffed by the rude delineations of boars in the four fide ftones ; 
or, what is more probable, perhaps he had, in fome of his warlike conrcfts, H un.
four Caledonians, of redoubtable prowefs, who were even taller than himfclf; 
and their nation, fize, and fate be thus deferibed by four proflrate boars, each of 
them upwards of feven feet in height.
f 
As to the done called the Giantâ€™s Thumb, it is no more than the remains of an 
old rofe-crofs, rudely cut, and now broken; perhaps it was an ornament of the 
old church : we fee many of thofe rofe-crofles on old abbeys ; there is a very fine 
one remaining on the weft end of Lanercoft.
Mr. Pennant had over-lookea > 
that the upper part of the done was broken, and not chiffelcd: by examining it, 
it will, we doubt not, appear to demonftration, that the head of the done was 
originally circular.

In 1361, Robert de Burgham was licenfed to teach

After the diffolution of the chauntry,

the 1 6th year of her reign, refounded the fchocl, by the title of : ihe free grammar 
Jchcol of bfiieen Elizabeth in Penrith, and endowed it with the revenue of the dif- 
folved chauntry: to have a mailer and ufher, and be governed by five of the chief

a -year, to be applied by the churchwardens for edu- 
cating and bringing up poor girls in a free fchool, to learn to read and do feamftry 
work, or other learning, fuirable to the fex.
Mrs. Joan Lafcells, in 1671, gave 
by will 100I.

the fchool founded by Mr. Robinfon, in working of worded and knitting; which 
fum of money, by a judicious application, produces five pounds a-year, fecurcd

One Roger Sleddale, in 1690, gave ten pounds, to be lent

* Among the memorials of departed genius in this county, there are few more worthy of commemora- 
tion than tjj.ac Riif'jn , the fon ot llaac and Elizabeth Ritfon, of Eamont Bridge, born in 17 6r.
His 
father dying when he was young, and this his fon being decrepid and lame, his mother very naturally 
became defirous that he Ihould be enabled to get his bread, and accordingly exerted herfelf to give him 
fome education.
Under that excellent mailer, the Rev. Mr.
Blain, with whom he was a particular 
favourite, his progrefs was fo rapid, that, at nine years of age, he had made no ordinary proficiency in 
Greek ; and (hewed uncommon aptnd's in every branch of learning, in which he engaged ; his advancers 
therein feeming more like the revival of what he had already known, than the acquifition of new 
info rmat ion.
Anxious for the prefervation and purity of his religious principles, his mother removed him at thirteen, 
to the Quaker fchool at Kendal, much againft his inclination ; for Mr. Blain and lfaac Ritfon were 
fuited in genius.
The mailer was a man of line tafte ; and molt palfionately fond of the claflics.
A 
lelfon from him was more in the manner of a conference or converfation, than in the ufual dry dida&ic way 
<of fchools, being almoit as impatient of the flow dedu&ions of grammatical infeience, as his eager pupiL

from the river Petteril through this town, of great benefit to the inhabitants.

From the moment Ritfon ur.derftcod Greek, the father of poetry was his confiant companion; he 
read his battles with infatiable avidity: nor was he aflramed to defeend to the dories of heroic achieve- 
ments told of his countrymen.
Early in life, he became dextrous with the bow and arrow, fo as to 
be able, with his arrow, to hit a fmall wire at the end of the fchool room.
After his return from Ken- 
dal, lie dudied mathematics under Mr. John Sice, then refluent at How-Hill, in Mnngrifdale, in the parifh 
of Grey dock ; a very intelligent Quaker, and an excellent mathematician.
This hitherto unnoticed 
village fage, in mathematical learning, like his pupil and many others in thefe tieglefled {pots, like fome 
wild flower, blooms unfee n, and nvafes its fiucetnefs on the defert air.
Ritfonâ€™s ideas were fo clear, that 
he undci flood the propofitions in the fiift fix books of Euclid almofl as foon as he read them ; and had 
he afterwards confined himfelf to mathematical ftudies, there can be no doubt but that he rvould have 
diftinguifhed himfelf greatly.
At the age of fixteen, he began to indraft others, with great credit to himfelf, and advantage to his 
pupils at Cailifle; after about two yeais of patient acquiefcence in a courfe of life, in which his profits 
were fmall and his labouis gieat, he fet off on an excurfion into Scotland.
His intention was to walk 
all the wav to the Highlands, and in particular,, to-vilit St. Kilda and the Ifle of Staffa ; but we do not 
knorv that he proceeded farther than Mull or Col. This journey he mud needs have performed, literally, 
in the dile and charafter of a bard.
For, though he entered on it but indifferently provided, and with 
about twenty (hillings in his pocket, in about twelve months, he returned well apparelled, with a poney.
It is not in this way, that the hidories of thofe who travel into Scotland terminate.
In this tour he 
picked up many beautiful heroic ballads and fongs, which he often fung with infinite glee; a pleafing 
manner and paffionate exprefiion fupplying the defefts of voice and muiical tade.
On his return, he again fat down to the dull bufinefs of breathing dry rules into hecdlsfs ears .
He 
taught fchool at Penrith about as long as he had before pm fued the fame employment at Carlifle.
But, 
though the powers of his mind, his lively fancy, and the vivacity of his temper, always fecured him an 
admittance into good company, dill he fighed for a Situation of greater fcope, to enjoy opportunities of 
obtaining more copious information.
Accoidingly he a fecond time relinquifhed the ill-requited office of a 
fchoolmader ; and not much richer than before, fet out on a journey into Scotland, with the intention 
of Itudying medicine at Edinburgh.
Here he became particularly attached to the late Dr. Brown, who 
paid him much attention.
There was indeed a great refemblance between their charafters ; they were 
both of them men of genius and learning ; but eccentric, and fometimes imprudent.
During the two 
years that Ritfon remained at this celebrated feat of medical learning, he fupported himfelf by writing 
thefis for fuch of his fellow-dudents, as were either too indolent, or too illiterate, to write for themfelves.
Here too he wrote a poern, full of techinal medical terms ; in which the terms of art were mod happily 
applied It is much to be legrettea, that a very maderly tranflation of Hefiodâ€™s Tbecgony , and other 
works, has hitherto eluded our mod careful fearch ; and we fear, is irrecoverably lod.
There is a good 
evidence, that this work wa3 begun, whild Ritfon was under Mr. Blain, and before he was twelve years 
of age ; and he continued to correft it as long as he lived.
We believe it was the only work, about 
which he ever took much pains.
On his return from Edinburgh, he went to London; profefledly with the view of completing his 
medical education, by an attendance on the hofpitals, and on leftures.
In London alfo, having no other 
relource he fupported himfelf, we believe, by his literary exertions.
He publifhed a tranflation of Ho- 
mer's Hymen to Venus; which, though but indifferently executed, and far inferior to his Hefiod, was 
not ill received.
In his other poetical tfFufions, there was an original wildncfs ; his mind was drongly 
tinftured with the fombrous magnificence of his country; fo that his poetry, like Grayâ€™s, was fometimes 
overlosded with, what Dr. Johnfon calls, a cumbrous fplendour.
This, however, is not fo vifible in his 
trauflatians, which have all the eafe of modern compofitions.
He wrote with uncommon facility ; and 
his nrofe was vigorous and animated.
Of this the public is already in pofleffion of a fair fpecimen, in 
the Preface to Clarke's Survey of the Lakes ; which was written by Ritfon.
It feems to be the happy 
privilege of geniu3 to know every thing, even matters of faft, as it were intuitively.
Like the milk- 
woman of Bridol, Ritfon knew, underdood, and wrote well of, various matters, of which there is no 
evidence

There is a great weekly market held here on the Tuefday, and a fair on Tuefday 
in Whit fun- week ; Whitfuntide and Martinmas are (latute times for hiring fervants.
The 
evidence that he had ever heard.
All he could know of the antiquities of this county, he mud have 
picked up from mifcellaneous reading ; and from converfation with thofe who probably were lefs informed 
than he himfelf was.
He had written, and intended to have publifhed, a fet of Effays on Moral and 
philofophical fubjefts ; but thefe are alfo loft.
It would feem that he partly maintained himfelf in 
London, by taking private pupils : he alfo earned fomething by writing, for iome time, the medical 
articles in the Monthly Review.
Dr. Johnfon tomewhere fpeaks of the London bookfellers, as the bell 
patrons of men of learning.
This may be the cafe with thofe, who have already made their way to fame.
But, if we may judge from the cafes of Chatterton and Ritfon, bookfellers are not more forward than 
the rell of mankind, to patronize that genius, which the world has not previously patronized.
Ritfon, though lame, with the aid of his ftaff, was aclive and alert ; and he loved to wander among 
mountains and lakes, and there conceive and compofe poetry.
In fuch fituations, he touched every thing 
with the pencil of Salvator and Rofa.
His deferiptions were tremendoufly fublime.
Ritfon wrote only when he felt, and was prompted by fome incident or occurrence immediately before 
him.

it was thearfenal of the town, where the archers depofited their bows and arrows; 
being a place convenient on any alarm, to arm for defence.
Ritfon was too volatile, to be a good author.
It was difficult to prevail on him to revile and correft 
any thing.
The foregoing verfes are taken from his firft, and perhaps only, copy, written on the backs 
of old letters.
He was an admirer of Shakefpear; and well acquainted with the dramatic writers of Greece and 
Rome: and often talked of producing a dramatic piece on the Grecian model; in which, he faid, he 
would incorporate fome of the Lines here preferved; and of fimiliar fragments.
But this, and many other projects, which were for ever employing his bufy and fertile imagination, 
were all blafted by an untimely death.
After a fhort, but irregular life in London, he died, in a few 
weekâ€™s ilinefs at Ifliugton, in j 789; and in the 27th year of his age.
â€˜ Alas!

The Rev. Thomas Hohfon , it is prefumed was a native of Cumberland; though we have not been fo 
fortunate in our enquiries, as to afeertain the exadl place of his birth: but, it is fuppofed, he was born 
either in or near Penrith; and, probably, of low parentage.
He was on the foundation at Queenâ€™s ; 
and became a fellow.
In 1755, he was prefented to the reftory of Holwelf in Somerfetftiire: was in 
the commiffion of the peace for the counties of Somerfet and Darfct; and died in 1777.
His fon, a 
clergyman, is faid to be now living at Sherborne in Dorfctfinâ€™re.
In 1 745, he publifhed a very valuable 
poem, entitled â€œ Chriftianity the Light of the Moral World:â€ which is addreffed in a dedication, 
written in a flile peculiarly handfome and dignified, to Nicholas Franklyn Miller, Efq. of Hyde Hall in 
Hertfordlhire; to whom he appears to have been tutor: and from its being dated at Greenwich, we are 
led to conjedlute, that, as was the cafe with at leafh one other northern writer of great eminence in the 
literary world, he either kept the academy there, or was an affillant in it.
In the fecond volume of Seed s 
Pofthumous Works, the fourth Letter, addreffed to the Rev. T.
H. it is known was addrefled to our 
author.
He appears to have been on terms of great intimacy and fnendfhip with Seed; and we have 
fancied, that, in the very little of profe that he has written, there is fome refemblance to Seedâ€™s peculiar ftile; 
which is rich and flowing almolt to excels Seed fpeaks, as one who felt for his friendâ€™s bad Jiale of 
health , and laments that the, world does not encourage modejl worth.
The defign of his poem was, as he himfelf Hates it, tp reprefent the great difference there is between 
the difeoveries of reafon, and thofe that are made by revelation.
It therefore defetibes the midni -lit 
darknefs and oiiginal confufion of the firft rude chaos of nature, as a fignilicant emblem of the deplorable 
ignorance of the Heathen world; and the beautiful older and brightnefs of the univeife arifing from the 
light of the fun, as an expreflive and lively picture of the clear knowledge of the Chriftian.
It has 
been well obfeived, that poets have feidom been fuccefsful on religious topics: yet we think the poem 
before us not only philofophical, but highly poetical.
Our readers will, in fome degree,, be enabled to 
judge for th mfelves how fa> our opinion on this point is well or ill founded, from the following paffage, 
feledted from the 2 1 ft page of the poem : â€”

With its demcfnes, w as purchafed near a century ago, by John Pattinfon, Eft;, 
younger fon of Thomas Pattinfon, Llq. of Breaks, in YVcftmorland He left one 
ion, Chriftopher, who dying unmarried, the eftate de\olved on his three 
lifters; and, on a partition, Carleton-Hall was aftigned to the el deft, wife of 
Thomas 
* â€œ George Carleton , fon of Guy, iecond fon of Thomas Carleton, of Carleton-Hall, in Cumberland, 
â€œ was born at Norhatn, in Northumberland ; at the time his father was keeper of the caille there, was 
â€œ educated in grammar learning by the care of the northern apoitle, called Bernard Gilpin : who alfo 
â€œ (when he was fitted for the univerfity) fent him to St. Edmundâ€™s Hall, in the beginning of the year 
â€œ 1 5 76, being then feventeen years of age, aud exhibited to his ftudies, and took care that nothing fhould 
â€œ be wanting to advance his pregnant parts.
In the latter end of 1579, he took a degree in arts, and 
â€œ forthwith completed it by determination ; his difputes being then noted to exceed any of his fellows, 
â€œ that did their cxerciie in the fame Lent.
In 1580, he was eledted probationer of Merton College, 
â€œ wherein he fpent almoft five years before he proceeded in his faculty.
While he remained in that 
â€œ college, he was efteemed a good orator and poet ; but, as years came on, abetter difputant in divinity, 
than he had before been in philofophy.
He was alfo well verfed in the fathers and fchoolmen ; and 
â€œ wanted nothing to make him a complete theologift.
I have loved him , faith Camden in his Britannia, 
â€œ in regard of his Jingular knowledge in divinity 'which he profejj'eth , and in other more delightful literature ; 
â€œ and am beloved by him again.
What were his preferments fucceffively after he left that college, I can- 
â€œ not tell, became the regifter of the adls of that houfe is altogether iilent as to them.
Sure I am.
that 
â€œ after he had continued many years there, and had taken the degrees in divinity, he was promoted to 
â€œ the fee of J andaff, in 1618 ; and was one of the learned Englifh divines that were, by his majeftyâ€™s 
â€œ command, fent to the fynod of Dort, where he behaved himfelf fo admirably well, to the credit of our 
â€œ nation, that, alter his return, he was in i6rg, eledted to the fee of Chichefter.
He was a perfon of 
â€œ folid judgment and of various reading, a bitter enemy to Papilts, and a fevere Calvinift.

his only daughter, wife of the late James Wallace, Efq. his Majeffyâ€™s Attorney 
General.
Since his death, ihe has made it her chief refidence, and having em- 
ployed on its improvement much attention, added to a correct tafte, has fucceeded 
in rendering Carleton one of the moft beautiful fpots in this part of England.
â€” 
Nature certainly had done much in the difpofition of the features, and no attempt 
has been made to force or change the character her hand had imprefied upon the 
place.
The great merit is, that of having followed and affiffed the outline which 
flie drew.
The general fcene, incloled on all fides by hills, prefents in its whole 
afpeCt, retirement and tranquillity.
â€” -The houfe is plain and modern; its fitua- 
tion rather low', (though upon a Imall knoll ) commands, in front, an extenfive 
lawn, which is interfered by the river Eamont, while the Lowther winds round 
its extremity.
To the north, it is fheltered by a plantation of old trees, and a 
wooded hill.
To the eaft and weft, the ground rifes from it by gentle acclivities, 
and, extending on each fide, forms a fort of rude femicircle, and (huts in the 
lawn beneath.
The banks are rapid and abrupt, and cloathed every w here with 
hanging woods; through thefe the walks are carried, and at different points 
difcovering the country, open a fucceffion of views, varioufly charaCterifed, but 
univerfally beautiful.
From the terrace, on the weft, the principal objeCts are the venerable ftately 
ruins of Brougham Caftle, with the Park of Whinfield, once the refidence of the 
celebrated Countefs of Pembroke, now in the poffeffion of her defcendant, the 
Earl of Thanet.
Beyond is a wdde extent of country, clofed by that majeftic 
range of mountain, known by the name of Crofs-Fell.
On the eaft, the points of 
view are numerous, but the objeCts which diftin61y compofe them, are all united 
in that which is feen from a fmall temple, rifing in the midft of the wood, upon a 
bold projection of the hill.
On this profpedt is comprehended every variety of 
feature combined, w-ithout confufion, and arranged with the moft picfturefque 
effedt.
Beneath is the lawn, with the reaches and windings of the Eamont, fome- 
times fretted and rapid, at others gliding peacefully down its courfe.
On the 
point of a hill, at a fmall diftance, ftands the little chapel of Brougham, with a 
few trees furrounding it.
Beyond are fpread, in all their richnefs and grandeur, 
the woods of Lowther.

THE PARISH OF GRAYSTOCK.* 
I S feated on the river Petrill ; the country adjoining the road from Penrith is 
inclofed, and capable of great improvement: but here the fpirit of hufbandry 
and reformed cultivation, has not made a progrefs equal to fome other parts of this 
county.
Camden fays, â€œ And now Eden ready to fall in the TEftuary, receives two little 
â€œ rivers at the fame place, Peterill and Caude, which run parallel from the fouth.
** Upon the Peterill, befide the Petrianae before fpoken of, is Greyftock, the caftle 
â€œ of a family which has been long famous; deriving its original from one Ralph 
" Fitz Walter, of whofe pofterity, William de Greyftock married Mary, daugh- 
** ter and coheir of Roger de Morley, Lord Morpeth.
He had a fon, John, 
â€œ who having no iffue, obtained licence of King Edward I.
to make over his eftate 
â€œ to his coufin, Ralph de Granthorpe, fon of William, whofe pofterity, for a long 
â€œ rime, flour idled here in great honour; but about the reign of King Flenry VII.
" that family expired, 3nd the eftate came by marriage to the barons of Dacre; 
â€œ the heirs general of the laft of whom were married to two Tons of Thomas 
â€œ Howard, Duke of Norfolk.

â€œ On the cad fide of Allerdale, at the mountains Carrock and Grifdale Fells, 
â€œ and adjoining to the fouth fide of the fored of Inglewood, lies the barony of 
â€œ Grey dock, which contains all that part of the county above the faid fored, be- 
** tween the feignory of Penrith and the manor of Cadlerigg towards Kefwick.
â€ This barony, the Earl Ranulph Mefchines, gave to one Lyolf, or Lyulphe, and 
â€œ King Henry 1.
confirmed the fame to Pharne, the fon of the faid Lyolf, or 
" Lyulphe, whofe poderiry rook the name of the place, and were called de Grey- 
" dock.

* It may fatisfy the curiofity of fome to know the report of hhtorians, whofe credibility vve have thus 
rejected.
â€œ The father of Reward (Speed calls him Hereward, but Camden fays, Herwerdus) was 
â€œ Leofric, Lord of Bourne and the adjacent country in Lincolnlhire ; his mother was the Lady Edina, 
â€œ defeended from the great Oltac, a Duke among the Eafterlings in King Edgarâ€™s time 5 in whofe 
â€œ family I alfo find a noble kinfman of his called Howard.
â–  â€œ He ferved in the wars of Northumberland, Cornwal, Ireland, and after, in the lower Germany, 
C( where he made up much of his fame, and married a fair lady, called Turfrida, the daughter of a 
â€œ nobleman in Flanders, where he continued till the death of his father brought him home.
About this 
li time, William Duke of Normandy made his conqueft of this kingdom, and had gratified Johannes 
â€œ Jaillois, tâ€™ne French Count, now Eail of Holland, with Leofricâ€™s country of Holland, in the marfh- 
â€œ land ; and the Count very rudely had expulfed the lady, his mother, out of her pofleffions and dower.
â€œ Hewardus fet upon him with fuch forces as he could lpeedily raife.
took and held him pvifoner in de- 
â€œ fpight of the Conqueror, until he redeemed himfelf, and accounted for what he had done, with a large 
ium of money.
This drew thole of the nobility to the protection of his fword, which the Conqueror 
â€œ had chafed out of their country, who had fortified themfelves in the He of Ely, and made Hewardus 
â€œ their general, where he built a caftle that a long time after had his name.
But the Normans took 
â€œ advantage to infeft his country, and put him again to the recovery of it, which he fo fortunately fettled

of a Saxon of great note in the reign of King Edgar: fome authors have advanced 
this diftant origin, but our bell authorities^ derive them from Auber, Earl of 
Paffy, in Normandy, who by Adelina, daughter of Hubert, Earl of Evereux, had 
three fons, the youngeft of whom was called Vaicrine and Beaufon, and was Lord 
of Vernon, in Normandy, f He was an attendant of William the conqueror : was 
lucceeded by Roger his Ion, who fignalized himfelf againft the Welch, and poffef- 
fing the Caftle of Howard, in many of his expeditions made it the place of retreat, 
which occafioned it to be called in contempt his Den; fo that it gained the name 
of How ar den.
IVilliam his fon, was born in the Caftle of Howard , and affumed the local name.
He was of the council of King Henry I.
who gave to him in marriage, Maud the 
widow of Roger Bignd, Earl of Norfolk, in whofe right he poffcffed many valuable 
eftates in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.
Sir John, his fon had iffue, by Helen his wife, two fons, John who left a daugh-

Sir Robert , a fecond fon, who married Joan , daughter of Sir Thomas St. Mere,

He was fummoned to the parliaments of 23, 25, 28, and 32, King Edward I.

By his firft 
wife, Alice, daughter of Robert de Uffbrd, he had no iffue.
To his fecond wife 
he married Alice, daughter of Sir Edward Fitton, by whom he had iffue two fons, 
John and William.* 
Sir John, the eldeft fon, was a man of great and public character, and had the 
confidence of his fovereign.
King Edward I, whom he ferved in the 34th year of

Concerning his iffue by the lady Turfrida there is no mention, only 
â€œ of a daughter named Turfrida, married to Hugo Enermua, Lord of Deeping; but circumftances 
â€œ will perfuade us he had other iffue, as divers of his furname continued in that country a long time after

Howard conftifuted conftable of the caftieof Norwich, and fheriff of the counties 
of Norfolk and Suffolk : he was enriched by a grant in fpecial tail of five 
great manors, which had efcheated to the crown by the attainder of the Earl of 
Wiltfnire.
In the fecond year of that reign, he was joined in commiflion with the 
Lords Falconbridgeand Clinton, to keep the feas, having a command of ten thou- 
i'and troops, with which they greatly harraffed the French coaffs, facked the town 
of Couquet and fubdued the Ifieof Rhee.
In the 8th year, he was treafurer of the 
houfehold, and had a grant of the emoluments arifing from the mintage : in this 
year he cfcorted the Lady Margaret, the kingâ€™s lifter, into Flanders, and attended 
the fclemnization of her marriage with the Duke of Burgundy.
In the fucceeding 
year, we find him in the lift of the great men who were prefent on the oath off 
allegiance, being taken by Henry Percy, heir of the Earl of Northumberland, in 
the palace of Weftminfter ; and alfo w hen the Bifhop of Bath and Wells refigned 
the great feal.
In the tenth year of that reign, by the title of Lord Howard, he 
was made commander in chief of the kingâ€™s forces at fea, with commiflion to oppofe 
the Lancaftrian faction, which was gathering for a new ftorm, under the defec- 
tion of the Duke of Clarence, Richard, Earl of Warwick, and their adherents .
% 
In the eleventh year, he was made deputy governor of Calais and the marches : 
and in the fame year, was of the junto who took the oaths to the king.* In the 12th 
year, he was fummoned to patliament among the Barons, and in the fucceeding 
years of that reign, conflantly was in fummons.
He was one of thecommiflioners 
named for fettling the pale of Picardy ; and on the 22d of April, 1472, was made 
one of the knights of the garter.
In the 13th year, we fee his name as a com- 
miflioner with Lord Haflings, to treat with the Duke of Burgundy, for fettling 
differences; where he has the title of Sir John Howard, knight, Lord Howard.
In the 14th year, he was returned by indenture, to ferve the king in Normandy, 
for one year, with twenry men at arms, and two hundred archers.
In the 15th 
year, he accompanied the king to Calais, in the war w ith France.
f The kingâ€™s 
munificence 
f The family of Howard as well as the Mowbrays, whofe pofTeffions and honours they inherited, had 
always been fteady partizans of the houfe of York againft the houfe of Lancafter ; and the white orna- 
ment in the livery of the Howard family, is held by tradition, to be the reprefentation of a white rofe.
* The tenure of which oath was, â€œ Allegiance to King Edward, and a recognition of Edward his fon.
Prince of Vv T ales, Duke of Cornwall, and Earl of Cheftcr, as the very undoubted heir to the crowns and 
â€œ realms of England, France, and lordfhip of Ireland ; and they proinifed and fwore, that if they out- 
4 â€˜ lived their faid fovereign lord, they would accept the prince for their true and rightful King of Eng- 
** land, &c.
and behave towards him and his heirs as true and faithful fubjedls.â€ 
-f In the hiftory of Philip de Commutes, we find feveral anecdotes.
At the time the Duke of 
Burgundy was taking leave of the Englifit monarch, to return to his army, a fervant of the King of 
Franceâ€™s houfehold was brought in a prifoner, and after examination, was difeharged, as being the iirft 
captive of the war.
At his departure, Lord Howard and Lord Stanley faid to him, â€œ Do ourcommenda- 
tions to the king your mailer, if you can come to his prefence.â€ The French King conceiving the 
purport of the melfage, prefently fent an herald, who had orders to addrefs himfelf to the Lords 
Howard and Stanley, who introduced him.
A treaty enfued, and commiflioners were named to meet at 
Amiens; for the King of England, Lord Howard, Sentleger, Dr. Morton, afterwards chancellor of 
England} for France, the Ballard Bourbon, Admiral of France, Lord St. Piere, and the Bifhop of 
Avereux.

munificence was difplayed this year, towards this favourite, who had with great 
fidelity and care, concluded a beneficial truce with France; for the king granted 
to Lord Howard, in fpecial tail, four manors in the county of Suffolk, and two 
in Cambridgefffire, which had come to the crown on the attainder of the Earl of 
Oxford.
In the 17th year of the fame reign, he was in commiffion to treat with 
the court of France fora longer truce ; and in that year, had the office of conffable 
of the tower conferred on him for life.
In the 19th year, he commanded the 
navy againft the Scots, and had with him three thoufand men at arms.
The moft 
diftingui lhed mark of his fovereignâ€™s efteem, was the marriage of Thomas Howard* 
his fon, to the princefs Anne, the Kingâ€™s third daughter.
In the reign of King Richard III.
we find this nobleman ftill a ffedfaff adhetent 
to the houfe of York.
It doth not appear, that he was cenfured for any evil 
counfels in that reign ; or that he was buiy, or even aiding in any of the dreadful 
crimes imputed to the king.
The virulence with which hiftorians have cenfured 
the meafures of that ffiort reign, would neceffarily have expoled to public odium 
the character of Lord Howard, had he not been critically and meft diftinctly ex- 
culpated, in the judgment of the world, from being a partizan in, or privy to the 
horrid machinations of this prince ; and this more efpecially, as he had received 
from the crown the greateff honours.
John, Duke of Norfolk, held the office of 
marfhal of England, with limitations to his iflue male ; in failure of which, it 
w ent over in reverfion to the crown.
By the death of his grace, the office becom- 
ing vacant, it was claimed by his lordfhip, who was the next defeendant of Thomas* 
Duke of Norfolk.
Without any inquiry into the legality of the claim, King Richard 
conferred that office upon him, by the title and honour of Earl Marshal of 
England, limiting it to his iffue male.* On the fame day he was created Duke 
of Norfolk, and Thomas his fon and heir, Earl of Surry.
On the coronation 
of King Richard III.
he was, for that folemnity only, conffituted High Steward of 
England, and carried the crown ; the Lord Surry carrying the fvvord of ftate.
In the 
enfuing month, he was made Lord Admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine, 
for life .
% He fell at Bofworth field, commanding in the main army for the king, the 
3 A 2 2 2d 
Avereux.
A tmee was concluded, and the articles ftipulated were, that the French King fhould pay to 
England, before the army left the country, 27,000 crowns ; and that his fon, the Dauphin, fhould marry 
King Edwardâ€™s eldeft daughter, (who was afterwards efpoufed to King Henry VII.) and that the 
Duchy of Guienne, or 50,000 crowns yearly fhould be afiigned for her revenue for nine years ; and that 
the two fovereigns fhould have an interview.
1 6,000 crowns were granted as a yearly penfion to the at- 
tendants of King Edward; of which 2000 were allotted to the Lord Haftings,and the reft to Lord Howard 
and others ; befides which, the French King gave prefents to Lord Howard, during his refidence in 
France, to the amount of 24,000 ci owns.
* He had power to grant the office of mat Aral of the Kingâ€™s Bench, marfhal of the Exchequer, and 
office of marfhalâ€™s crier before the fteward, and marfhal of the Kingâ€™s Houfhold.

*â€™ Fyrlt you {hall know the feid Duke was, in his yonge age, after he had been a lufficient feafon at 
the gramer fchole, hcncheman to Kyng Edward IV.
and was then called Thomas Howard, fon and heir 
to Sir John Howard, knight, (after Lord Howard, and after that Duke of Norfolk) of right inheritance.
And the feid Thomas, when he was at mannes age, was, wyth divers other gentlemen of England, fent 
to Charles, Duke of Burgon, in the begynning of the wars betwyxt Kyng Lewes of Fraunce, and the 
feid Duke Charles ; and ther contynued unto the end of the feid warres, to his great prayfe and thankys, 
as well of Kyng Edward hys own foverayn Lord, as of the feid Duke Charles.
And after the warres

And be was aboute him at hys makyng redy, botlie evenyng and mornyng.
And afterwards he 
made hym knyghte, at the marriage of the Duke of York (Kyng Edward his fecond fon) and fo he 
wyth the feid Kyng Edward in all hys bufynes, as wel at Lyncolnfhii e field, and at the tyme of Banbury 
field, as at all other hys bufynes ; and alfo at fuche tyme as the fame kyng was taken by the Earl of 
Waiwyke, at Warwyke, befor his efcape and departyng into Flaunders.
â€œ And after the kyngâ€™s departyng into Flaunders (9 Edw. 4 ) for that the cooils of Englond were 
fo fett, for departyng of any other his fervantis and frendis, the feid Thomas Howard was dryvin of

Edward.
And at the feid kyngâ€™s retorne out of Flaunders, the feid Sir Thomas Howard refortyd unto 
hym, and went with him, to Barnet Feld ( 10 Edward 4 ) and there was fore hurte.
â€œ And after whan Kyng Edward wint into Fraunce wyth hys army royall, he fent thether before

yng wyth Charles, Duke of Burgon, as in dyverfe feldes and bufyneffes v'ith the feid Kyng Fdward, he 
had therfor commandment to go over wyth them, for hys advyce and councell, till the feid Kyng came

courage, valour, and intrepidity.
He was committed to the tower by King 
Henry VII.
and remained in durance upwards of three years; after which, he ob- 
tained the royal pardon, was received into favour, made one of the kingâ€™s privy 
council, and proved a faithful and triijly fervant to his fovertign during the whole courfe 
of his life.* Soon after his liberty was reftored, he was reinftared in his dignities as 
Earl of Surry, and to the pofteflions of his wife.
It is evident he was a man much 
to be confided in, by his being immediately employed by the king, to fupprefs 
an infurredtion in the north, with a great force committed to his command ; in 
which duty he acquitted himfelf with lingular honour.
He appears among the 
knights who held a chapter of the order of the garter, at Windfor, on the 7th day 
of May, in the 1 8th year of that reign ; but when he was reinfiated in that order, 
we cannot find any certain account.
In the 7th year of this reign, he was indentured to ferve the king, with ten men 
at arms, twelve demy launces, twenty archers on horfeback, and fifteen on foot.
In the fucceeding year, he was employed in reprefiing the incurlions of the Scots.
In the 10th year, as fub-warden and vice-guardian under the kingâ€™s fecond Ion, 
Henry, Duke of York, of the weft and middle marches, he was cormniflioned to 
mufter all the men able to bear arms between Trent and Tweed, and lead them 
againft the Scots who threatned a formidable invalion.
He was aftbeiate of 
Richard, Bifhop of Durham, in the treaty with James, King of Scotland, at the 
abbey of Mailrofs about the marriage of the princefs Margaret.
In the 13th year 
of this reign, he marched againft the Scots, who were then before the caftle of 
Norham, and on their retreat, he advanced to the Scotch borders, and returned 
with great fpoil and booty.
In the fucceeding year, we find him in the lift of 
lords aflenting to the peace made with France.
In the 15th year of this reign, a 
partition was made of the lands of Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, between him and 
Maurice, brother of the Marquis of Berkeley.
He attended the King and Queen 
to Calais, on the Sth of May ; and was a witnefs to the ratification of the marriage 
of Arthur, Prince of Wales, to Catharine, the King of Spainâ€™s daughter.
On the 
25th of June, in the 1 6th year of this reign, he was made Lord Treafurer of Eng- 
land.
In the fucceeding year, he appears among the commiftioners named for 
Having been taken prifoner in the battle of Bofworth, and committed to the tower by King Henry VII.
and attainted by parliament ; King Henry afked him, how he durft bear arms in behalf of that tyrant 
Richard ; to which he anfwered, â€” He was my crowned king, and if the parliamentary authority of 
England fet the crown upon a dock, I will fight for that ftock : and as I then fought for him, I will 
fight for you, when you are eftabhfhed by the faid authority.
In the rebellion againft the king by the Earl of Lincoln, the lieutenant of the tower offered him the 
keys of the tower, that he might let himfelf at liberty ; but he replied, that he would not be fet at liberty 
by any power, but by that which had committed him.
When the Scots made an itruption into England, and befieged Norham caftle, this Earl raifed the 
fiege, took the caftle of Ayton, and made all the country round a defart.
This fo incenfed James IV.
of Scotland, that he fent a herald with a challenge to him ; to which the Earl made this fenfible and 
fpirited anfvver .
â€” That his life belonged to the king, whilft he had the command of his army ; but when 
that was ended, that he would fight the king on hoifeback, or on foot; adding, that if he took the 
king prifoner in the combat, he would releafe him wi'.hout any ranfom ; and that if the king fhould 
vanquifti him, he would then pay fucha fum for his liberty, as was competent for the degree of an Earl.

Through all the high trufts which were repofed in this nobleman in thefe

He preferved his integrity to the laff, and in no one inffance was it more 
diffinguifhed, than in his refignation of the office of Lord High Treafurer, at the

been fupplied by every refource, that could be attempted or gained : and in no

In the 3 iff

This great nobleman, whofe aCtions had been fo illuftrious, w hofe

In imitation of Lama, our Earl had his Geraldine.

he does not fpecify.

From Tufcan came my ladieâ€™s worthy race, With Kingâ€™s childe, where (he tafleth coftly foode.
Fair Florence was fome time her auncient feat ; Honfdon did firft prefent her to myn yien ; 
The weftern yle whofe pleafant (liore doth face Bright is her hewe, and Geraldine (he highf, 
Wild Cambers clyffs did give her lyvely heate ; j Hampton me taught to withe her firft for mine, 
Foftered (he tvas with milk of Irifh bred: ; And Windfor alas 1 doth chafe me from her fight.
Her fire an Earl ; her dame of Princeâ€™s blood Her beauty of kinde, her vertue from above.
From tender yeres in Britainc (he doth reft Happy is he that can obtain her love.
I am inclined to think, that her poetical appellation was her real name, as every one of the circumftances 
tally.
Gerald Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, in the reign of King Henry VIII.
married to his fecond 
wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Gray, Marquis of Dorfet ; by whom he had three daughters.
Lady Margaret, who was born deaf and dumb, (probably not the fair Geraldine) Elizabeth, third wife 
of Edward Clinton, Lari of Lincoln, and the Lady Cicely.
Genealogifts fay, that the family of 
Fitzgerald derives its origin from Otho, defeended from the Dukes of Tufcany, w-ho in the remn of 
King Alfred fettled in England, and from thence tranfplanted themfelves into Ireland.
Thus, â€œ From 
Tufcany came his ladyâ€™s noble race.â€ Her fire an Earl, and her being foftered with milk of Irifh bread, 
follow of courfe.
Her dame being of princeâ€™s blood, is not lefs exaCt ; Thomas, Marquis of Dorfet, being 
fon of Queen Elizabeth Gray, daughter of the Duchefs of Bedford, of the princely houfe of Luxemburg.
The only queftion is, whether the Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, or her fifter the Lady Cicely, w'as the 
fair Geraldine.
I (hould think the former was, as it is evident, (he was fettled in England.
The cir- 
cumftance of his firft feeing her at Hundfon, indifferent as it may feein, leads to a ftrong confirmation 
of this conjecture.
Sir Henry Chauncy fays.f that Hundfon houfe, in Hertrordfhire, was built by 
Henry VIII.
and deftined to the education of his children.
The Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, was fecond 
coufin to the princefs Mary and Elizabeth, and it was natural for her to be educated with them, as the 
fonnet exprefsly fays the fair Geraldine was.
The Earl of Surry was in like manner brought up with 
the Duke of Richmond, at Windfor.
|| When he attended the young duke to vifit the princefs, he got 
fight of their companion ; when he followed him to Windfor he loft that opportunity.
If this affump- 
tion wanted any corroborating incidents, here is a ftrong one.
The Lord Leonard Gray, uncle of the 
Fitzgeralds, was deputy of Ireland for the Duke of Richmond, and that connexion alone would eafily 
account for the Earlâ€™s acquaintance with a young lady, bred up with the royal family.
The following 
(hort genealogy, will at once explain what I have faid, and (hew that in every light, my opinion feems 
well grounded.

Surry was a young man of the molt promifing hopes, and had difiinguifiied himfelf by every accom- 
plifhment which became a fcholar, a courtier and a foldier ; he excelled in all the military exercifes 
which were then in requeft ; he encouraged the fine arts by his patronage and example ; he had made 
fome fuccefsful attempts in poetry; and being frnit wiih the romantic gallantry of that age, he celebrated 
the praife of his miftrefs by his pen and his lance, in every mafque and tournament.
His fpirit and ambi- 
tion were equal to his talents and his quality ; and he did not always regulate his conduct by that caution 
and referve which his fituation required.
Fie had been left governor of Boulogne, when that town was 
taken by Henry â€¢.
but though his perfonal bravery was unqueftioned, he had been unfortunate in fome

The king fomewhat difpleafed with his condudt, had fent over Hertford 
to command in his place : and Surry was fo imprudent as to drop fome menacing expreflions againft the 
minifters, on account of this affront which was puc upon him ; and as he refufed to marry Elertfordâ€™s daugh- 
ter, and even waved every propofol of marriage which was made him ; Henry imagined that he had enter- 
tained views of efpoufing the lady Mary ; and he was inftantly determined to reprefs, by the mod fevere

Actuated by all thefe motives, and perhaps too, influenced by

Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, A.
D. 1663.
Framlingham Cadle is a very ancient druCture, and faid to have been built in the time of the Saxons.
It was one of the principal feats of St. Edmund the king and martyr.
When he fled from Dunwich, be- 
ing purfued by the Pagan Danes, he tcok refuge in this cadle, but being hard befieged, and having no 
hope of refeue, he fled from thence, and being overtaken by his enemies, was beheaded at Hoxon, from 
whence, long after, his corps was removed and reinterred at Bury, called St. Edmunds Bury.
Matthew 
Paris informs us, that William Rulus gave this cadle to his favourite Roger Bigod ; and learned Mr.
Camden fays, that this cadle if not rebuilt, yet was tepaired by his fon Hugh Bigod, who was created 
Earl of Norfolk, by King Stephen, becaufe he tedified on oath before the Archbiihop of Canterbury and 
others, that King Henry willed on his death bed, that Stephen his nephew, and not Maud his daughter, 
Ihould fucceedhim in the kingdom of England.

This Hugh was the fon and heir of the before-mentioned Roger, who was fewer to King Henry I.

He married 
Juliana the daughter of Almerick de Vere, the kingâ€™s chamberlain and had iffue Roger Bigod, Earl of 
Norfolk, and William a fecond fon, who died in the 24th year of Henry the fecond, and was buried in 
the priory of St. Bennet, in Thetford.
Afterwards this caftle was given by King Edward 1 .
to his

fubje<ft to death: but fo corrupt in this aera of Henryâ€™s reign, was even the ad- 
miniftration of juftice, that he was found guilty of treafon, and beheaded on Tower 
Hill, on the 19th oi the fame month.
We will take the liberty to introduce in 
this place, the character given of the earl in the â€œ Hiftorical anecdotes of fome 
of the Howard family, by the honourable Charles Howard, Efq. 1759,â€* after- 
wards Duke of Norfolk.
â€œ When I intended to have given fome account of this nobleman, I found it 
" already done, by one of the moll; ingenious gentlemen of our times, Mr. Horace 
â€œ Walpole; I therefore fhall do little more than tranfcribe the character he gives.â€ 
" We now emerge from the twilight of learning, to an almoft clafTic author, 
that ornament of a boifterous, yet not unpolifhed court, the Earl of Surry, 
â€œ celebrated by Drayton, Dryden, Fenton, and Pope, illuflrated by his own mufe, 
â€œand lamented for his unhappy and unmerited death: a man, as Sir Walter 
" Raleigh fays, no lefs valiant than learned, and of excellent hopes.
â€œ He feemed to have the promife of fortune as illuftrious as his birth, by being 
<f the friend and at length the brother-in-law of the Duke of Richmond, Henryâ€™s 
** natural fon.
â€” But the cement of that union proved the bane of her brother!
<c He {hone in all the accomplifhments of that martial age; his name is re- 
Â« nowned in its tournaments, and in his fatherâ€™s battles: in an expedition of his 
â€œ own, he was unfortunate, being defeated endeavouring to cut off a convoy to 
â€œ Boulogne ; a difgrace he foon repaired, though he never recovered the kingâ€™s 
<c favour in whofe eyes a moment could cancel an age of fervices.
â€œ The unweildy king growing diftempered and froward, and apprehenfive for 
â€œ the tranquillity of his boy fucceffor, eafily conceived or admitted jealoufies in- 
â€œ fufed into him by the Earl of Hertford and the proteffant party, though one of 
Â«â€¢ the lafl atfls of his fickle life was to found a convent.
Rapin fays, he appre- 
â€œ hended if the popiftt party fhould prevail, that his marriage with Catharine of 
4C Arragon would be declared good, and by confequence his fon Edward baflardized.
â€œ A moft inaccurate conclufion !
It would have affecfted the legitimacy of Elizabeth, 
â€œ whofe mother was married during the life of Catharine, but the latter was dead 
â€œ before the king married Jane Seymore.
An odd circumftance is recorded, that 
â€œ Anne Boleyn wore yellow for mourning for her predeceffor.
â€œ It feems that the family of Howard were greatly at variance; the duke and 
Â« his fon had been lately reconciled; the duchefs was frantic with jealoufy, had 
â€œ been parted four years from her hufband, and now turned his accufer; as her 
Â«* daughter the Duchefs of Richmond, who inclined to the proteftants, and hated 
â€œ her brother, depofed againft him.
The dukeâ€™s miftrefs too, one Mrs. Holland, 
â€œ took care to provide for her own fafety, by telling all fne knew : that was little, 
â€œ yet equal to the charge, and coincided with it.
The chief accufation againft 
This catt 1 ' was very fair and beautiful, fortified with a double ditch, high banks, and rampiers.

Â« forborne them, but left a blank quarter.
Mrs. Holland depofed, that the duke 
Â«Â« difapproved of his fonâ€™s bearing them, and forbade her to work them on the fur- 
et niture for his houfe.
The Duchefs of Richmondâ€™s teftimony was fo trifling, that 
â€œ fhe depofed her brotherâ€™s giving a coronet,* which to her judgment feemed a 
** clofe crown, and a cypher, which fhe took to be the kingâ€™s; and that he diffuaded 
Â«* her from going too far in reading the fcnprurc.Â§ Some fwore that he loved to 
Â«* converfe with foreigners; and as if ridiculous charges, when multiplied, would 
<f amount to one real crime ; Sir Richard Southwell affirmed, without fpecifying 
â€œ what, that he knew certain things, which touched the earlâ€™s fidelity to the king.
Â«* The brave young lord vehemently affirmed himfelf a true man, and offered to 
" fight his accufer in his fhirt; and with great fpirit and ready wit defended him- 
Â«< felf againfl all the wfitneffes â€” to little purpofe !
When fuch accufations could be 
â€¢* alledged, they were fure of being thought to be proved.
Lord Herbert infirm- 
â€œ ates, that the earl would not have been condemned, if he had not been a com- 
â€œ moner, and tried by a jury.
On what could he ground this favourable opinion 
â€œ of the peers?
What tw'elve tradefmen could be found more fervile, than almoft 
Â« every court of peers during that reign?
Was the Duke of Buckingham, w r as Anne 
Â«* Boleyn condemned by a jury, or by great lords?
The duke, better acquainted 
â€œ with the humour of his mafter, or fonder of life as it grew nearer the dregs, 
â€œ figned a mod abjetff: confeflion, in which, however, the greareft crime he avowed 
â€œ was, having concealed the manner in which his fon bore his coat armour an 
â€œ offence, by the way, to which the king himfelf and all the court muff: long have 
" been privy.
As this is intended as a treatife of curiofity, it may not be amifs 
** to mention, that the duke prefented another petition to the lords, defiring to 
â€œ have fome books from Lamberh, without which he had not been able to com-

â€œ never omitted any thing that concerned his own honour, or the kingâ€™s lervice.â€ 
He and Earl Surry were both attainted in parliament by fpecial bills which palled 
on the 20th day of January, which preceded the kingâ€™s death only eight days, he 
then lay in a languilhing Hate.
The death of the fovereign did not allay the 
vehemence of the dukeâ€™s enemies, who remained powerful in the cabinet of King 
Edward VI.
: they had fufficient influence to get him excepted from the general 
pardon proclaimed on the kingâ€™s acceffion.
A difcufiion of this matter took 
place in the firft year of Queen Mary, before the commons, when it appeared, on 
the teftimony of Lord Paget, that the attainder was not regular, for want of the 
royal confirmation or aflent, the feal having been affixed ex officio, as preparatory 
only for the fovereignâ€™s fignature ; but, before the completion of which, death re- 
moved the tyrant, and fnatched his hand from this iniquity.
Whereupon it was 
adjudged that the title remained unattainted, and that without the procefs of 
pardon or reflitution, he Ihould be acknowledged in his ducal dignity: in con- 
sequence of which we find him foon after in the execution of his office of High 
Steward, prefiding at the trial of the Duke of Northumberland.
In the aft of 
repeal, it is recited, â€” â€œ That there was no fpecial matter in the aft of attainder, 
but only general words of treafon and confpiracy : and that out of their care for 
the prelervation of the king and the prince theypafled it.â€ Such was the jeopardy 
of a great man, under the corruption of fitch a Hate.

Â§ 
On the deceafe of Queen Mary, Thomas, then Duke of Norfolk, was prefent at 
the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth.
He was a man of excellent parts and 
genius, and grew into great favour with the queen : the firft teftimony of her re- 
gard, was his admiffion to the order of the garter, at the fame time the Marquis of 
Northampton and the Earl of Rutland were inflituted.
In the fecond year of that 
reign, he commanded the army in the north, and carried on the fiege of Leith, 
where the French had a ftrong force in fupport of the marriage contradl made 
with the Queen of Scotland ; and which was maintained by the Englilh troops, 
till a peace was made, and the French evacuated the town.
In the 6th year, he was one of the queenâ€™s attendants to Cambridge, where, with 
feveral others, he received a honorary degree of Maffer of Arts.
Soon after this period, commenced thofe unfortunate connections between the 
duke and Mary Queen of Scots, which terminated in as affedting a tragedy, as 
marks the Englilh hiltory.
Some authors have alledged, that there was great 
ambiguity in the evidence which was brought to charge the duke with this 
engagement for which he buffered; and although his character was that of a man 
of knowledge and erudition, there yet is, in his conduCt, a duplicity which would 
have thrown infinite uncertainties in the way of hifforians, even to this day, had

a doubt behind : Camden fays, <f That Lidington her ambaffador in England, fc- 
veral times mentioned to the duke, that a marriage with the Queen of Scots was no 
impracticable thing, and that he was a perjon who dejerved to be the hujband of a 
queen f â€œ But that he always moved it with a modejl refufal .â€ In the eleventh of 
Queen Elizabeth, we find him in the commifiion to hear and determine touching 
the depofition of the Queen of Scots; but the nominees were recalled before a 
determination was made, as Camden fays, â€œ to the great fatisfadtion of the duke, 
who always heartily efpoufed the Queen of Scotsâ€™s title to the fucceflion ; being of 
opinion, that it was aimed to fix a lafting mark on her and her fon, to exclude 
them both, as unworthy to fuceeed to the throne of England : had he given fen- 
tence againft her, he muff have wronged his own confcience, and utterly ruined 
her ; or, on the contrary, he muff have incurred the queenâ€™s high difpleafure, and 
drawn on himfelf the odium of all that were ill affedied to the Queen of Scots, on 
the fcore of religion, or any other account.â€ It appears that Murray made fomc 
kind of propofal for the Queen of Scotsâ€™s marriage with the duke ; and from this 
period arife thofe ambiguous circumftances we have hinted at.* ** It is evident thar 
Queen Elizabeth had entertained an implacable averfion to the unfortunate 
princefs, and, in conlequence, was utterly averfe to fuch a marriage: fhe had de- 
termined the deftrudfion of Mary, and the ruin of her adherents followed of 
courfe.
Some authors have more than hinted that jealoufy had its fliare in in-

not clear of imputations, which the frailell of her fex have had flamped with the

that a plot was laid to proclaim her heir of the crown, in cafe any thing happened

;Â£ 
The Earl of Leiceflerâ€™s character is branded with treachery to his friend in this 
bulinefs; for when the duke was informed of the queenâ€™s difpleafure, he entreated the 
earl to dilcover to her majefty the whole matter, and intercede for pardon ;* but, 
on

â€œ inftead of dafeontinuing the negociation, he renewed it with greater vigour, and admitted into it new

t â€œ A combination of the Englifh nobles-had taken place again!!
Cecil, whofe power and credit were 
objects of indignation and jealoufy, and the Duke of Norfolk had been adtive and fuccefsful in promo- 
ting the fcheme of his marriage with the Queen of Scots.
Taking advantage of the condition of 
parties, he had pradtifed with the principal nobility to encourage his pretenfions to Mary, and he fecretly 
communicated to them the promiles of fupport he had received from the Earl of Murray.
By the ad- 
vice and influence of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, he engaged in his behalf the Earl of Leicefter, and this 
nobleman imparted the matter to the Earls of Pembroke and Arundel.
The duke himfelf was able to 
conciliate the favour of the Earls of Deiby, Bedford, Shrewfbury, Southampton, Northampton, 
Northumberland, Weflmorland and SufTex. In the mean time he was eagerly prefiing Mary herfelf 
with his fuit and importunities, and they had mutually exchanged the tokens of a conftant and fincere

* â€œ Little doubt was entertained of the fuccefs (of the articles drawn up by Bifhop Rofs) and the Earl 
of Leicefter, to complete the bufinefs, and to ferve the Duke of Norfolk, undertook to give them a more

of Scots.
The difpatches fent to the Queen of Scots were in the hand writing of Leicefter, and fubferi-

Â« Notwithftanding the caution with which Mary and Norfolk carried on their intrigues, intimations- 
of them had come to Elizabeth.
Norfolk himfelf, by the advice of the Earl of Pembroke, f had ventured 
to difclofe his fecret to Sir William Cecil, who affedled to be friendly to him.
The regent tranfmitted 
to her the proceedings of the convention at Perth.
She commanded Sir William Cecil, to apply himfelf 
to difeover the conlpiracy.
This ftatefman betrayed the confidence with which he had been entrufted ; 
and Elizabeth, while the duke was attending her at Farlam, difeovering a mixture of pleafantry and 
pafllon, admomfhed him to be careful on what pillow he repofed his head.
The Earl of Leicefter,.
â– alarmed by his fears, revealed to her at Titchfield the whole proceedings of the Duke of Norfolk and his 
friends.
Her fury was ungovernable; and, at different times, fhe loaded Norfolk with the fevereft re- 
proaches and contumely, for prefuming to think of a marriage with the Queen of Scots, without the 
fanftion of her concurrence.â€ Stuart.
Robertfon fays, â€œ the intrigue was now in fo many hands, that it could not long remain a fecret.
It 
began to be whifpered at court; and Elizabeth calling the duke into her prefence, exprefled the utrncfl 
indignation at his condudl, and charged him to lay afide all thoughts of profecuting fuch a dangerous defign.
Soon after Leicefter, who perhaps had countenanced the projeft with no other intention, revealed all the 
circumftances of it to the queen.â€ 
One part of Maryâ€™s condudl does not appear to have been taken into confideration : Bothwell, whom 
fhe had married, furvived the Duke of Norfolk.
The tenets of Maryâ€™s religion deprived her of all hopes

on the contrary, he concealed it, and, by vain promifes, deluded the duke, till fick- 
nefs bringing him to remorfe, he related the whole to the queen, who came to viftt 
him.
The queen, with great wrath, reprehended the duke, and commanded him, 
on his allegiance, to forbear every pretenfion to fuch an alliance: to which it is 
faid, with great earneftnels, he promifed obedience: but from that period he per- 
ceived the queenâ€™s looks and behaviour were become cool and indifferent; 
Leicefter avoided him ; the courtiers treated him with a contemptuous negledt, 
and every indication of the fovereignâ€™s difpleafure was obfervable by the manners 
of the minions of the clofet : a womanâ€™s paffions feldom have the good fortune to 
be moderate: no middle quality or character intervenes between love and detef- 
tation: and difappointed affedtion almoft always ends in hatred.
The duke 
â– withdrew himfelf from court, and took up his reiidcnce with the Earl of Pem- 
broke, who gave him the mod fanguine hopes of a reconciliation : but the queenâ€™s 
fentiments broke forth the fame day; and, with a mod unfeminine want of 
tendernefs, fhe fincerely replied to the Spanifh ambaffadorâ€™s interceffion for the 
enlargement of the Queen of Scots, that ihe recommended her â€œ to bear her 
condition with lefs impatience, or fhe might chance to find Jome, on whom Jhe 
placed, her befi hopes JJoorler by the head > in a very little time.â€ This was a full 
expreftton of malice propenfe, â€” the denunciation of death againft this unfortunate 
nobleman: and from that moment, thofc w'ho happily know by conjedture only, what 
intriguing and corruption are ufually employed by the minions of a court, 
will want no farther proof to convince them, that all the evidence which was 
afterwards gained, to charge the duke, was venal and corrupt, or frivolous and 
irrelevant.
There arc, and always have been, wretches ready to countenance and 
fupport any meafures, however iniquitous againft a man, thoâ€™ never fo meritorious, 
to purchafe the deteftable fmile, that applauds fervility.
The dukeâ€™s retreat 
afforded too favourable a pretence for the increafe of injurious reports; and 
the ill-timed applications of the French ambaffador for the liberty of Mary, ferved 
only to irritate the queen to ft ill greater violence againft: her former favourite: 
many emiffaries w T ere employed to find matter of public accufation againft the 
duke; among the foremoft of whom was Cecil, who, by certain dark dealings 
with Suffex, Lord Preftdent of the North, and Murray the Regent, was faid to 
have obtained fome capital evidence.
This, accompanied by a rumour of a re- 
bellion having broken out in the northern counties, ftruck the duke with fuch a 
panic, that he privily withdrew himfelf to Norfolk, till he could, by his friends, 
and by fubmiftion to the queen, appcafe the gathering ftorm.
But even in this 
retreat he difcovered he had fpies upon him, who reported every adtion; and his 
prefumed friends at court were become cool and indifferent.
He trembled for 
the fate of Mary, on whom thefe rumours w'ere well calculated to heap frefh perils.
Thofe who w'ere ftncere with him, advifed him to throw himfelf at the queenâ€™s 
feet, confefs his inmoft intentions, and crave her mercy; and accordingly he pre-

Murray, intimating, that the duke had been pradtifmg with him to favour and 
afiifi: his marriage with the Queen of Scots, attended with rhreats if he did not 
comply; that he had promifed him his fervices, to prevent his defign, which, he 
feared, was formed againft his life.
That foon after, he had a letter from the 
duke in private characters, in which he vowed he never would relinquish the 
princefs.Â§ The duke was examined, and upon feme confeffions, which, it is faid 
he made, was committed to the Tower, 11th OCtober, 1569.
A rebellion, 
headed by the Earls of Westmorland and Northumberland, immediately enfued, 
and an infurredtion appeared in Norfolk, but thofe were foon repreSTed ; perhaps 
they contributed to haften the dukeâ€™s releafe ; who, on entering into a folemn 
contract* not to concern himfelf with Maryâ€™s marriage, without the previous 
confent of the queen, was difeharged : but it was conjectured, and not without 
good grounds, that he was fee at liberty to appeafe the people, and that he might 
on a future day befnared by fome inadvertency, togive a more plauSible pretext to 
remove him from the world.
The Queen of Scots was foon after fully allured, that all profpedt of her deliver- 
ance, from the channel file had hoped, was extinct; and in the midft of her 
distraction and difpair, file fent, by a fecret mefienger, a Scheme of her defigns, 
with feveral pafiionate letters, to the duke, written in cyphers only known to them- 
felves: at the fame time file fent letters to the Pope and King of Spain.
The 
duke feems to have been extremely unhappy in the confidence he placed in his 
fervants, and thole neareSt his perfon ; for Hickford his fecretary, w ho had com- 
mand to tranferibe the papers fent him, and to burn the originals, difobeyed his lordâ€™s 
orders, and concealed thofe momentous inftruments in the matting of the room; 
with a defign to betray him, as was evident in the fequel; â€” a corrupted wretch, 
deviling the destruction of his lord, who had repofed in him his honour and his 
life.
Camden and other authors of that day acquit the duke of being privy to 
Rofsâ€™s plot, and fpeak of him as having a foul fo noble, that he was always averfe 
to every bale action.

Lord Herries and the Scots had committed hofiilities, and ravaged the borders ; 
Mary entrufted to the French ambaflador a fum of money, to be fent for their 
fupport; he delivered it to Barker and Hickford, who, it is faid, but without any 
proof, communicated the bufinefs to the duke, and then delivered the charge to 
one Brown, one of his graceâ€™s retainers, who, being of a timorous difpofition, gave 
up the whole to the privy council.
There feems to be determined treachery 
againft the duke, in this whole bufinefs.* Hickford was apprehended, and then 
difcovered all he knew, and informed of the papers he had concealed.
Now, reluctantly, we enter on the mod, if not the only, fullied part of this great 
manâ€™s character.
It is beneath the dignity of virtue to fioop to an evafion ; it is 
infamy to any man to defcend to a falfehood.
The Duke being apprehended, on 
his examination denied the papers, with which by Hickfordâ€™s treachery, he was 
confronted to his face; his excufe was the language of confufion and iliame, â€” 
Â«â€¢ I am betrayed by my confidants â€žâ€¢ though diffidence is the very ejfience of wifdom , I

his graceâ€™s character ; and would palliate his offence by every argument confifient 
with the circumftances and facts.
He was committed to the Tower on the 7th 
of September, in the year after his former releafe ; and all his adherents were 
apprehended, whofe confeffions, derived from the love of life, ferved to confirm

but did not extend to prove, with precifion, any traiterous aid given to the ene- 
mies of the realm.

On the 1 6th of January, 1 572, he was brought to his trial in Wefiminfier-Hall, 
before George Talbot, Earl of Shrewfbury, conftituted Lord High Steward on 
the occafion ; twenty-five peers fat in judgment.
He was denied counfel, as 
being unprecedented in cafes of high treafon, on which he faid, â€˜ f To-day I muft 
plead for my life, my eftate, my children, and (which is above all ) my honefty ; 
as for my honour let it go.â€ " If I die innocent, God will be fure to avenge my

mediately paffed upon him.
He remained in prifon four months before execution.
The queen, from certain 
feelings of compunction, and from old affeCtion, appears to have been defirous 
of granting his pardon ; but the commons, to whom the hidden truths lay undif- 
covered, and who were moved by the evidence of an obnoxious character, and the 
inftigations of thofe who wanted him removed out of their w'ay, urged her high-

Philip, eldeft fon of the laft Duke of Norfolk, by his fatherâ€™s attainder, 
was deprived of the title, efiate, and dignities of his anceftors on his fatherâ€™s fide ; 
but in right of his mother, as owner of Arundel Caflle, he had the title of Earl of 
Arundel, which had been adjudged in the parliament, 1 1 th King Henry VI.
to be 
a local dignity, and that the pofiefibrs thereof fhould conflantly enjoy that title of 
honour : in that right he fat in the parliament of 23d Queen Elizabeth, and was 
therein, by a fpecial aÂ£t, teftored in blood.
At this time the fever of reformation, and the intemperate zeal of religious rage 
againft bigotry and fuperftition blazed in the bofom of many zealots, of whom 
the Earl of Leicefter and Secretary Walfingham were not the moft moderate: 
they thought there was a pious merit in enfnaring and betraying thofe eminent 
perfons, who were not yet quite weaned from the church of Rome.
The Severity 
of the laws, made at this period, denote the intemperance of zeal that raged ; and 
there are proofs, that forged letters were difperfed to render obnoxious certain 
great men, and make their lives and converfations fubjedt to popular ferutiny and 
cenfure.
Philip, devoted to the religion of the church of Rome, had determined 
to retire to fome fafer place of refidence beyond the fea ; but, previous to his de- 
parture, he wrote a letter to the queen, intending it fhould be delivered to her 
when he had quitted the land, in which he lamented the unhappy neceflity he 
was under of departing from his native country ; he made known to her the in- 
veteracy of the enemies of his family, their power being as irrefifiible as their 
malice was implacable of alleviation, and their determined purpofes threatened 
him with death.
To make the grounds for his withdrawing himfclf ftill more 
â€¢weighty, he reminded the queen of the unhappy fate of his anceftors; and as every 
injury is accompanied with the implacable hatred of the perpetrator; he pointed 
out that thofe who had triumphed in the decollation of his father, would be reftâ€” 
lefs whilft his fons remained within her dominions.
Therefore, that he might not 
perifh in the like manner, he chofe to retire for his foulâ€™s health, but without any 
diminution of loyalty to her as his fovereign.
Such was the remonftrance pre- 
pared to be thrown at the feet of the queen ; but before it could be delivered, 
having gone privately into SufTex, to take fhipping in a fmall creek there, his flight 
was difeovered by fome of his menials, and he was apprehended and committed 
prifoner to the Tower.
He was charged under a profecution in the Star Chamber, 
â€œ with fupporting Romifh priefls contrary to law: that he held a coriefpondence 
with Parfons the Jefuit, and Cardinal Allen, enemies ot the queen ; and that he had 
publicly, in writing, queflioned the juflice of the kingdom, intending to depart 
the realm without licence.â€ Camden fpeaks of the earlâ€™s fubmiflion, and that 
he protefted his obedience to the queen, and love of his country ; but, declaring 
his ignorance of the law, acknowledged his attachment to the Catholic church of 
Rome: he was accordingly fined 10, oool.
and was fentenced to be imprifoned 
during the queenâ€™s pleafure.
Notwithftanding this heavy fine impofed upon the earl, and an imprifonment 
of four years and a half, in the 33d year of the queen, he was accufed of high

appointed high Reward on that occafion, and twenty-five peers, on the 14th of 
April, 1589.J On being arraigned, he faid, â€œ Here is as true a manâ€™s heart and 
<c hand as ever came into this hall.â€ â€” He was found guilty and condemned to die.
The earl, without a complaint of the feverity of his perfecution, petitioned that 
he might obtain of her majefty, leave for the payment of his debts, that he might 
be attended by his fervants on his private affairs, that his wife might vifit him, 
and that he might embrace his infant fon, born during his confinement; and whom 
he had never feen.
Camden fays, â€œ There were many that mod heartily lamented the untimely fall 
" of this young nobleman, who was not above thirty three years of age at the molt : 
*â€¢ and as many on the other fide were as ready to cry up the queenâ€™s wifdom and 
â€œ caution, who, by this example had ftruck a terror in the more powerful part of 
â€œ the Romifh faction.
The queen after all, gave him his life and was well enough 
â€œ fatisfied w ith having leffened the power of fo conliderable a man, and one who 
â€œ was fo great a bulwark of the Catholic caufe.â€ 
Although mercy was fo far extended to this unfortunate earl, as to be fpared 
from the fcaffold, yet his imprifonment was as effectual, though a flower execution ; 
for, by a broken fpirit and a kind of religious aufterity, which he enjoined himfelf,

family, was deprived of honour, and left with a fmall proportion of the inheritance 
of his anceRors.
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, he enjoyed by courtefy

He was fortunately under the direction of

took the greatefi care of his education ; fite knew how to bend to the Rorm which 
had borne fo hard upon her family, and withholding her fon from public appear-

early wifdom and learning, which flourifned forth in his accomplifhed character.
On the acceliion of King James I.
he was feventeen years of age, and his friends

all that he gained was reRitution of blood, and part of the Arundel eRates, with

cellent conjugal felicity, but greatly increafed his fortune ; for the two elder filters 
dying without iflue, he fucceeded to the large pofieffions of that family.
The 
greatnefs of his birth and quality, and the powerful fortune, were not fo much the 
caufe of his advancement to an eminent ftation of life and in the date, as his un- 
common genius, wit and learning.
In the year 1607, he was fworn of the privy 
council, and four years afterwards was inDalled knight of the garter.
In the joth

| Copy of a letter from James Theobald, Efq. to the right honourable Lord Willoughby de Parham, 
prefident of the Society of Antiquaries of London.
My Lord, 
Having obferved, in the minutes of this fociety of the 26th of May, 1 757, that mention is there made of 
a monthly pamphlet, publifhed in the years 1707 and 1708, intitled, Memoirs for the Curious, in which 
notice is taken of, that the noble and valuable Mufeum of curiolkies of all forts, as well natural as artificial, 
which had been collected at great expence from all parts of the world, by that great patron of learning 
and the liberal arts, Thomas Earl of Arundel, which was depofited in his palace, called Arundel houfe, 
in the Strand ; and flood between thufe of Effex houfe on the call, and Somerfet houfe on the well ; the 
garden of which came down to the river Thames, of which it had a fine view, as alfo of the city of London 
eaftward as far as London bridge, and of the city of Weitminller, and weftward as far as the Nine Elm;, 
in the parifh of Batterfea ; I thought it would not be unacceptable to your lordlhip, and my worthy bre- 
thren, the members of this fociety, to have fome further account of fome part of that collection when 
riilperfed, which have come to my knowledge, and into whofe hands fome of them are fallen, and are at 
prefent ; in hopes this may incite others, who have any anecdotes of thefe things, to put them in writ- 
ing, in order that they may be entered into the chronological regifter of the fociety, wheie recourfe may 
be had to them, that they may not be buried in oblivion.
An aCt ol parliament was obtained to entail that noble eflate on the heirs male c f the Norfolk family, 
and to exempt it fr> m being charged either with jointures or family debts ; and gave a power to the then 
Duke of Norfolk, to let a part of the houfe and gardens to builders at a refervtd ground-rent, which rent 
was to accumulate, in order to raife a fund for building a maniion-houfe for that family, on that part of 
the gardens which lay next, the river.
The Duke of Norfolk, after the eflablifhment of the royal fociety, gave that worthy fociety permiffion 
to hold their meetings in Arundel houfe, but now, as it was to be pulled down, they removed to Grefham 
college ; and as he had made the royal fociety a prefent of his noble library, that was alfo removed thither.
Arundel houfe being now pulled down, great part of the furniture was removed to Stafford houfe with 
the mufeum, &c.
And as there were many line bafs relieves and marbles, they were received

who whilft in Italy, were joined by their mother, whofe great affeAion made her 
anxious to vifit them ; and it is remarked, that in all places fhe was received with 
honour and refpecft, â€œ above any pcrfon of our nation that had vifited thofe parts.â€* 
But 
into the lower part of the gardens, and many of them placed under a colonade there, and the upper 
part of the ground, next the Strand, let to builders, who continued the ftreet, next the Strand, fronv 
Temple-bar towards Weftminfter ; and alfo to build thereon, the feveral ftreets, called Arundel, Norfolk,, 
and Surry -ftreets, leading from the Strand towards the river, as far as the crofs ftreet, called Howard- 
ftrect, which ran parallel with the Strand.
When the workmen began to build next the Strand, in order to pi event incroachments, a crofs wall 
was built to fcparate the ground let to building from that referved for the family manfion ; and many of 
the workmen, to fave the expence of carrying away the rubbifh, threw it over this crofs wall, where it fell 
upon the colonade ; and at laft, by its weight, broke down, and falling on the ftatues, &c.
placed there, 
broke feveral of them.
A great part of thefe, in that fad condition, was purchafed by Sir William 
Fermor, from whom the prefent Earl of Pomfrct is defccnded.
He removed thefe down to his feat at 
Fafton Nefton, in Noithamptonfhire.
where he employed fome ftatuary to repair fuch as were not too 
much demolifhed.
Here thefe continued till the year 1755, when the prefent countefs made a prefent of them to the 
un'verfity of Oxford ; ar.d, on the 25th Feb. 1756, (he received the thanks of that learned body from 
their chancellor, the Eai!
of An an, and their lord high fteward, the earl of Weftmorland; and, the year 
following, the univerfity celebrated a public aft, where, in a fet oration, and in a full theatre, ffie was 
again complimented by them in the moft public manner, for her noble and generous benefaction.
A.mong this collection was the famous deeping Cupid, reprefented as lying on a lionâ€™s lkin, to exprefs 
his abfolute dominion over fiercenefs and ftrength.
On the flein are fome rofes fcattered as emblems of 
filence and fecrecy, Cupid having prefented the flower to Barpocrstes, the god of ftlence, as a bribe to 
him to conceal the amours of his mother.
The rofe is alfo fuppofed to be congenial with Venus, and 
facred to her.
Below the foot of Cupid, on the bed, is the figure of a lizard ; which fome have fuppofed 
to have been placed here as a known ingredient of great efficacy in love charms ; others, as a proper at- 
tendant on thofe who fleep, from the opinion, that this reptile wakes them on the approach of danger ; 
and others have imagined it to have been an emblem of fleep itfelf, who lie torpid a great part of the year, 
and is placed near the ftntue of Somnus on a monument at Home.
But the real defign of the fculptor is 
rather to perpetuate his name by this fymbol, which was Saurus, which figniftes a lizard.
The Romans 
obfeiving how much the Grecian ftatuaries excelled them in this art, whenever they employed them to 
execute any wotk of this fort, foibid them, as had been cuftomary, putting their names to their works ; 
and Pliny tells us, that Saurus had recourfe to this expedient, by putting this fymbol to this figure, as well 
as in another which he executed jointly with Batiachus, where they were not permitted to put their 
names, and therefore on the bafes they placed the figures of a frog and a lizaid.
Some other of thefe broken ftatues, not thought worth replacing, were begged by one Boyder Cuper, 
who had been a fervant (I think gardener) to the family, and were removed by him to decorate a piece 
of garden ground which he had taken, oppofite Somerfet Watergate, in the parifh of Lambeth, which at 
that time, was a place of refort for the citizens and others in holiday, ftill called after him by the name 
of Cuperâ€™s, and thence corruptly Cupidâ€™s gardens, which were much of the fame nature as Sadlerâ€™s wells 
and Mary bone gardens, called alfo a mufic houfe, as they had always rr.ufic attending, and a large room 
for dancing when the company were fo difpofed.
Here they continued for a confiderable time, till Mr. John Freeman of Fawley Court, near Henly on 
Thames, Oxfordfhire, and Mr. Edmund Waller of Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamfhire, happening to fee 
them, and Â» bferving fomething mafterly in the defigns and drapery of feveral of them, and chat they were 
fragments of very curious pieces of fculpture, they called on me, who then lived in the neighbourhood, 
to know the then owner of them, Mr. John Cuper, and, finding him, I was defired to treat with him 
for them, and they left in my hands a bank note of Tool, with liberty of going as far as that 11m.
After 
two or three days meeting, 1 agreed with him for them for 75I.
which I paid him, and foon after they 
were divided between thefe two gentlemen, and fent by them, part of them to Fawley Court, and part to 
Beaconsfield, where they at prefent remain.

On the removal of Lord Chancellor Bacon, the Earl was made

What ftatues and broken fragments yet remained undifpofed of in Arundel gardens, the Duke of 
Norfolk obtained leave from the crown to remove crofs the water, juft on the oppofite fhore, to a piece 
of wade ground in the manor of Kennington, belonging to the principality of Wales ; and one Mr.
Arundel, a relation of the dukeâ€™s, was employed by the duke to folicit a grant of it from the crown to 
him, which I think was at the latter end of the reign of King Charles II.
or King James II.
and ac- 
cordingly he did obtain a grant of the faid piece of ground, at a fmall rent, for a term of years, which 
expired fometime when the prefent king was Prince of Wales, and was renewed on paying a fine, by Mrs.
Rawe of St. in Cornwall, to whofe hulband, Mr. Arundel, at his dectal'e, left the leafe, 
Mr. Arundel having taken the leafe in his own name, inftead of the Duke of Norfolkâ€™s, by whom he had 
been employed.
What were thought not worth removing, were buried in the foundations of the buildings in the lower 
part of Norfolk-ftreet, and the other buildings on the gardens.
Mr. Aiflabie, who inhabited one of thefe 
houfes, I am informed by the prefent dukeâ€™s fteward, found a broken ftatue in his cellar, which he 
carried down to his feat in Yorkfhire ; and he alfo tells me, there is a farcophagus in the cellar of Mr. James- 
Adamfon, who lives in the cornet houfe on the left hand, going into the lower part of Norfolk-ftreet.
As to thofe carried over the water, and laid on the Piince qf Walesâ€™s ground, Mr. Arundel, foon after 
he obtained the grant of the ground, let it for a timber-yard, and the perfon who took it, built up a wharf, 
and when the foundation of St. Paulâ€™s was laid, great quantities of rubbifh w r ere brought over thither to 
raife the ground, which ufea to be overflowed every fpring tide ; fo that, by degrees thofe ftatues and other 
marbles, were buried under the rubbifh brought to raife the ground, and lay therefore many years almoft 
forgot and unnoticed.
About the year 1712, this piece of ground was rented by my father, who, hav- 
ing occafion to eretl buildings on the ground, and digging foundations, &c.
frequently met with fame of 
thefe fragments which were taken up and la d on the furface of the ground.
The late Earl of Burlington, 
having heard of thofe things which had been dug up, and that they were a part of the Arundel colleiftion, 
and meeting me at the royal fociety, or at my late worthy friend, .Mr Hans Sloanâ€™s, ipoke to me, and 
defired he might take a view of them, which he accordingly did, and feemiag to admire them, I told him, 
they were at his fervice.
Accordingly he chofe what he pleafed, and carried them down to Chifwick- 
houfe, where one piece of bas relievo he placed in the pedeftal of an obelifk he eretted there.
Some years after which, the Right Honourable Lord Petre fpeaking to me of thofe things of the 
Earl of Burlington, told me that he had heard, that on fome parts of my ground, there were (till many 
valuable fragments of tire Arundelian marbles lay buried, which he had been told by the Duke of Nor- 
folk.
I inferred him what I had met with, but feared there could be little of any confequence remain- 
ing ; as at different times, different parts of the ground had been dug up.
He defired I would give him 
leave to employ fome men to bore the ground, and endeavour to find them, which I readily confented to.
Accordingly he fet men to work, and after fix days fearching every pait, juft as they were going to give 
over, they fie 1 upon fomething which gave them hopes, and upon opening the ground, they difeovertd fix 
ftatues, w ithout head or arms, lying clofe to each other ; fome of a colofial fize : the drapery of which 
was thought to be exceeding fine.
When they were taken up, I was furprized to find fucking to fome 
of them, a fmall foit of Conical Barbaris, which convinced me they muft formerly have lain in the fea 
where thofe animals fallen themfclves to them, as they do to rocks and fhip bottoms ; but what I thought 
furprifing, was, that although they muft have ftood long expofed to the air, and perhaps had been fo 
long underground, they were not fallen off.
Thefe trunks of ftatues w r ere foon after fent down to Workfop, the feat of his prefent Grace, the 
Duke of Norfolk, in Nottinghamfhire, where they at prefent remain.
There were fome few blocks of a fort of greyifh veined marble, out of which I endeavoured to cut fome 
chimney-pieces, and flabs to lay in my houfe, the Belvedere in Lambeth parifh, over againll York Build- 
ings, but the expence was more than their worth ; however, as they were cut, there were fome of them 
ufed.

The Duchcfs of Norfolk, who had been divorced from the Duke, and who was heirefs of the Peter- 
borough family, and afterwards married Sir George Germain, among other valuable eftates and effefts, 
carried with her that fine colleftion of cameos and intaglios belonging to the Norfolk family, and which

â€œ is faid of him, that he never went to court but when he was obliged to do it by 
<{ his ftation and the places he held.â€f 
On the acceffion of King Charles, he was continued in the office of Earl 
Marfhal, was one of the kingâ€™s fupporters at the royal interment, was made one 
of the commiflioners to determine claims at the coronation, and joint in commil- 
fion with the Earl of Pembroke for creating knights of the Bath.
Soon after he 
fell under the difpleafure of the fovereign, and various caufes are afligned for his 
imprifonment.
Our noble author, to whofe anecdotes it is with pride that we fo 
often refer, fays, â€ Yet fuch was Charlesâ€™s attachment to his favourite and fellow 
* c traveller, the Duke of Buckingham, that he committed the Earl prifoner to the 
tc Tower upon the meeting of parliament, for being concerned in impeaching that 
tf nobleman.â€ â€” On Rufhworthâ€™s authority, we muff beg leave to diffent from the 
caufe here afligned by our noble author; being rather inclined to believe, the fpe- 
cious pretext, (whatever other heart burning might inffigate the meafure in the 
kingâ€™s breaff,) was a feverity of language ufed to the Lord Spencer on our Earlâ€™s 
marriage of his eldeft fon Henry, Lord Malrravers with the Lady Elizabeth Stuart, 
eldeft daughter of the Duke of Lenox, which was contracted without the fove- 
reignâ€™s privity, he having intended to efpoufe her to the Lord Lome.
The Earl 
and his lady were a long time confined in the country, and afterwards removed 
to the Tower, and Lord Maltravers and his lady were confined at Lambeth, under 
the care of Archbifhop Abbot.
On this occafion the Lords fhewed a noble exer- 
tion of their privilege, finding the commitment was unwarrantable, they ffrenu- 
oully infilled on his being releafed ; and perfevered in their refolution with laudable 
fteadinefs, infomucâ€™n, that voting to proceed on no bufinefs till their requilition 
was complied with ; Charles, for once, found himfelf obliged to let his favourite 
prerogative give place to necefiity ; and the Earl was enlarged.
We now again purfue the account given by our noble author.
â€” â€œ The unhappy 
â€œ fate of the favourite, Buckingham, put an end to thefe jealoulies ; and our Earlâ€™s 
<l great virtues and uncommon merit, foon forced the approbation, and of courfe 
ft the favour, even of Charles ; who fent him to condole the Queen of Bohemia 
<c upon her hufbandâ€™s death, and alfo appointed him ambalfador extraordinary to the 
Â« Rates general.
He was alfo ccnftituted chief juffice of the foreff north of Trent; 
Â« and accompanied the king, in the year 163 3, when he vilfted Scotland, his 
<* native country.
He was afterwards, in the year 1636, appointed ambaflador to 
â€œ the Imperial diet, where he difeharged his ccmmiflion with his ufual integrity.
â€œ Though an utter enemy to drefs and the pageantry of courts, yet on this occa- 
Â« lion he let his own inclinations give place to the honour of his country ; the 
Â«* appearance he made being fplendid and magnificent ; equal to that of a fovereign 
Â« prince.â€ In 1638, he was appointed general of the forces fent to quell the in- 
furredtions of the Scots, on account of the book of church difcipl ine impofed on 
them: but a treaty of peace loon after took place.
He found the king out of 
humour with the concelTions made to the Scots, and the courtiers were involved in 
diflentions, infomuch, that he determined to leave the court for a time and retire to

In Augufl, 1640, the Scots having

General fouth of Trent, with commiffion to levy forces and form a fecond army to 
fupport the meafures and aflift the operations of the troops commanded by the 
Earl of Strafford.
On the meeting of the fucceeding parliament, his fon, Sir William Howard,

The bill of attainder againft Lord Strafford, which

** Bacon, he being pointed out by the public as the mod proper perfon in the 
â€œ kingdom for that high office, on account of his virtue, his unblemifhed honour, 
â€œ clear judgment, and great learning.
But Buckingham finding that the Karl, 
â€œ from his dilinrereftednefs and referved conduct, had but few friends in parlia- 
â€œ ment, w hich the miniffer was obliged to court, was drawn off fi om his purpofe, 
â€œ by that pafiion which is ever predominant in a thorough paced courtier.
Thus 
â€œ we fee our Earl appointed to fome of the highed offices of date, and defigned 
â€œ for more, without cringing to power or courting fadion.â€!
He certainly difcerned the dorm w hich w'as gathering in the date, and w'eary 
of the budnefs of a court, determined to make his declining health an excufe for 
leaving the kingdom and retiring to the Spa; he had already withdrawn his grand- 
children, whom he had placed at Utrecht for their education.
The return of the 
Queen, mother of France, from this country, gave him an honourable opportunity 
of departing as efcort ; his countefs accompanied him : but through fome anxieties 
which hung upon him from the love of his country, he could not refid a defire of 
vifiting England, and returned in the winter: â€” The afped of public affairs dill 
grow ing more gloomy, and his power not being equal to his wifhes, he finally' 
withdrew himfelf from his native land in the fucceeding fpring, accompanying the 
Princefs of Orange and the Queen her mother, to Holland.
,f From that time 
<f until his death, he may be looked upon as a voluntary exile, lamenting the fad 
â€œ condition of his king, and the honour, laws, and liberty of his country.â€!
He 
pafled from Holland to Antwerp, w here he took his lad farewell of his lady, for 
travelling from thence to Italy, he never lived to return.
He fudained twm great

w ith a didemper which in its confequences affeded his brain, and his third grand- 
fon, Philip, abfeonded, and profefled himfelf a friar of the Dominician order.
After moving from place to place for four or five years, he repaired to Padua, 
where his elded fon, the Lord Mowbray viffted him : England being then dif- 
traded with the miferies of a civil war.
In the year 1646, he had thoughts of re- 
turning to his native country, but was, during his preparation feized, with a mortal 
difeafe, and expired at Padua, on the 14th of September, having entered into the 
fixty firfi year of his age.

41 It is the caufe of truth, and 1 dont think myfelf lefs at liberty to refeue the memory 
Â« f of my anceftor from calumny, than that of any other man.
From what has been 
â€œ already faid of this nobleman, it appears that his general deportment was referved, 
â€œ and that, being very little folicitous about court preferment, and anxious to 
*' maintain his independence, he never cringed to minifiers, and feldom appeared 
at court, but when his bufinefs called him there.
He was ever ready to accept 
of any employment fuitable to his rank, which his fovereign thought proper to 
â€œ confer upon him ; but never fought to procure it, by abjecftly foliciting for it, 
â€œ nor by fafticn.
It were greatly to be wilhed for the repofe of thefe kingdoms,

<( related to his own family , in which no doubt there had been fome memorable pr.rfons 
(< Thus has this noble hidorian, by fix-ng the fpring of adion to his purpofe, in 
" fome places, and in others aflerting fads from his own authority, in plain con- 
â€œ tradidion to every other writer, endeavoured to deface this lively pidure, and 
â€œ place it in the mod contemptible view.
But this great man fecms to fall floor C 
" here of his uiual precifion and accuracy.
He fhould have tranfmitted to us the 
â€œ unaccountable means, by which this odd compoiirion of pride and ignorance, 
â€œ as he would fet him forth, was, without any kind of felicitation from himfelf, 
" appointed to the fird places in the date, and the moll important commiflions 
u abroad, though he kept the world at fuch a didance, and fcarcely treated his

â€œ minillers with condefcenfion, and even acknowledged them to be their lords and 
** mailers, if they were appointed to thefe offices, that they mud be conferred on 
â€œ a man who was almod illiterate?
Nay, further, he fhould have let us know by 
â€œ what kind of magic this man, unaided by literature, could have difeharged the 
â€œ feveral important offices of Earl Mardial, Conftable, and i.ord High Steward 
,f of England, and ambaflador abroad on the mod intereding concerns, w ith 
â€œ univerfal applaufe to himfelf, and utility to the public.
" I dtall pal's over other trifling cenfures of this noble writer, and come to the 
â€œ grand blow which he levels at our earl in the conclufion of his character.
As 
â€œ the earl was an utter enemy to inflammatory factions and parties, whether re- 
â€¢' ligious or political, fo he never countenanced them.
With refped to the for- 
** mer, 1 fuppofe he thought, as every good man does, that Chridians of every 
" denomination fliould live together with that concord and harmony defigned by 
â€œ the fird bleded Founder, and therefore could not abet any party divilions, with 
,f refpedt to religion, to the didurbance of the peace of his country.
From this 
" Lord Clarendon takes upon him to proclaim to the world, that our eari had 
little or no religion at all.
He was , fays he, rather thought not to be much con- 
â€œ cerncd for religion , than to incline to this or that party ; and he concludes with a 
u coup de grace thus : and he died under the fame doubtful char abler of religion in 
â€œ which he lived.
How much more could be faid of an infidel ?
The bed method 
** I can take to confute this alfertion, is to produce the earlâ€™s lad will, dated at 
â€œ Dover, the 3d of Sept.
1640, to public view ; whereby it will appear, beyond a

In Mungrifdale, and fome

enjoying the fun, produces early crops of barley and oats, almoft the only grain grown there.
In 
Matterdale little but oats ; about Johnby, Grayltock, and Motherby, fome wheat is produced ; the foil 
appears very good for that grain, if fown in proper feafon, and the iand duly prepared by fallowing and 
dreeing.
The farmers are prejudiced againft the growing of wheat, on account of the coldntfs of the 
climate, and becaufe the land lies fo high ; but early fowing, &c.
would obviate thefe objections.
â€” Oats 
and barley are the grains chiefly grown ; but meadow and pafturage are the hulbandmanâ€™s chief objects, 
as the rents are made up from cattle and flieep.

deer; moil of them fallow 7 , fome red, and a few American.
Game.] Groufe abounds on the mountains and commons, â€” partridges in the lower grounds, and in

Housmanâ€™s Notes.
Jofeph, the fon of Jeremiah and Sarah Sowerby, of Murray, in this pariih, was boin in 1721.
Being 
the olded of eight children, his father intended to have brought him up to hufbandry ; but not well 
brooking the drudgery of that kind of 1 fe, he contrived, during the fhort intervals of red from his daily 
labour, to pick up a little Englifh and Latin, together with fome arithmetic, and a tade for the mathe- 
matics, from one Naughlin, a Scotfman, (who, afterwards, by following the example of Origin, in 
emafculating himfelf, as the only remedy, it was fuppofed, for his incontinency, became the fubjedt of 
very general converfation) the curate of Threlkeld.
Thus qualified, he commenced Lhoolmader at the 
neighbouring village of Lamonby : dill continuing to add a little, during his moments of leifure, to his 
little dores of learning, by the inllrudtions of Mr. George Smith, a perfon often mentioned in this work.
His next dep was removing to Penrith, where he taught the ufe of the globes, and other branches of 
adronomy and the mathematics.
From Penrith he went to London : and there, on a larger fcale, commenced teacher in St. Paul'* 
Church-yard.
Here, as a mathematician, he was held very high in the edimation of his cotemporaries ; 
but unfortunately for his memory, he has publilhed no work to fupport that charaCler.
Poderity mull 
be contented therefore with the following account of him, faid to be written by Dr. James Bradley, of 
Oxford : â€” 
â€œ Oft. 12 thy 1749.
â€” On Thurfday lad died at his lodgings in Edmonton, Mr. Joleph Sowerby, a

In the fame year, the pope's legate, Alexander Nevill, Archbifhop of York, con- 
verted this reeftory into a college, and thereof conftituted Gilbert Bowet the firfl 
mafter, and appointed fix canons, to whom he gave the chauntries founded in that 
church, viz.
John Lake, the chauntry of St. Andrew â€” Thomas Chamberlayne, the 
chauntry of St. Mary â€” John Alve, the chauntry of St. John Baptift â€” Richard Car- 
well, the chauntry of St. Catharine â€” Robert Newton, the chauntry of St. Thomas 
the martyr (Becket) and John de Hare, the chauntry of St. Peter.
Soon after the diffolution of religious houfes, it came to be contefted, whether 
this church continued redtorial, or by the dilfolution it became veiled in the 
crown.
The incumbentâ€™s title was regular by due prefentation, admifbon, inlh- 
tution, and induction, it appeared that the king had not joined in the creation 
of the collegiate conftitution, and that it was the foie adt of the pope; and further 
it feemed there had been no ufage of a common feal.
Judgment palled againft 
the crown, and the redtorial and parochial rights of the church were confirmed.
Judge Dyer, in his report of the cafe, 81, fays, the determination was grounded 
on the non-ufageof a common feal; and Lord Coke (4th co.

alfent not being proved, was lufficient caufe for the determination^

the ftyle in which it is built does not proclaim it older than the reign of Edward II.

1383, it became collegiate ; and there are yet remaining in the chancel, flails which have been for the 
members of the college; no remains of the chauntries are now vifible.

In the windows are feveral pieces of painted glafs, fome are entirely filled with it, but fo mutilated a3 
not to be underflood; the labels are chiefly, orate pro anima , of people who have been benefadtors to the

In the chancel, near the altar, is a very grand alabafler tomb of fome of the barons of Grayflock, it 
confifts of two knights, one of an enormous fize, clad in armour, and girt with his fword ; the other a

There are four feveral chapelries within this parifh, viz.
Watermellock, Matter- 
dale, Grifdale, and Threlkeld.
Watermellock, commonly called Newkirk parifh, 
from the church which was confecrated in 1558, by Bifhop Oglethorp.
It hath 
parochial rights of baptilVn and burial, and is endowed with a dwelling houfe 
and out-offices, with about ten acres of land, worth 7I.
a-year, a prefcriptivc- 
payment out of fixty-fix tenements, amounting to 61 .
ns.

out of which is 
paid to the reeftor ot Grayftock 2I.
the furplice fees amount yearly to about 20s.
and the land purchafed at Glenridding, by two allottments of Queen Anneâ€™s 
bounty, bring in about 14I.
a-year.
â€” The extent is about fix miles, and the breadth 
two miies and a half.
It is bounded E.
by Dacre, W, by Matterdale, N.
Hutton 
Soil, S.
Ullfwater; confiftsof one manor and one conftablewick; it contains about 
60 houfes and 335 inhabitants, of whom 1 74 are females, all of the church of 
England, except one Roman Catholic.
â€” The inclofed land, exclufive of Gowbar- 
tow parks, is not more than 2400 ac res, divided into 64 tenements.
It is remarked 
to us, and we apprehend, with the greateft juftice, that the feverility of the cufiomary 
tenure, prevents increafe of population; for, in the period of 20 years, from 1580, 
there were 320 chrifl.
249 bur.
and 86 mar.; and in a like period from 1680, 
there were 172 chrift.
143 bur.
and 28 mar,; and in the laft 20 years, there were 
160 chrift 84 bur.
and 42 mar.
There has been a late augmentation by Queen Anneâ€™s bounty, yet the income 
of the chnpelry docs not now exceed 30I a-year .

Matterdale and Warkffiwaite is holden of the barony of Grayftock.
To this

of Edward Hanfby, B.
D. redlor of Grayfiock, without prejudice to him and his 
fuccclfors, in right to tithes or other ecclefiaflical dues; the parifhioners of the 
chapelry, at their own charge, to provide and maintain a proper minifter, with 
convenient dwelling and maintenance, to be approved by the Bifhop of Carlifle; 
a parifh clerk with a falary, and two wardens, and to keep the chapel in repair.

their wool.
Here is a wide extent of common right, which affords an excellent

little inferior to coal, as fuel.
In fome of thefe moffes, particularly Flafcow, which 
abounds with excellent turbary, and luxuriant herbage, large trees have been 
found, chiefly oak and hazle, with nuts upon the branches.
On the north eaft of the 
chapelry, is a beautiful green conical hill, called Wefter Mellfell, which commands 
anextenfive profpedt, looking over a large expanfe of cultivated country, beauti- 
fully diverfified with hills, vales, woods, rivers, and gentlemenâ€™s feats; the eye

with its lofty cathedral, the fea to the north and weft, the Cheviot hills, and a 
long tract of mountains in Scotland.
The value of this mount will be better 
eftimated, when it is known that the tenants of Matterdale expended one half 
of their eftates, in defending there title to common right upon it, by a fuit with 
Andrew Huddlefton, Efq; Lord of the manor of Hutton John: in the year 
1690, a decree in the Court of Exchequer was obtained in their favour.
There 
is a tradition, that a perfon zealoufly adtive during this protradled fuit, walked on 
foot from Matterdale to London in three days, in a pair of wooden-clog-Jbod boots.
The chapel is a perpetual curacy in the gift of the redtor of Grayftock; the 
prefent building was eredted in 1685.
The original falary was 61 .
now augment- 
ed by Queen Anneâ€™s bounty to 36L The Bible and prayer-book are of the old 
Englifh black letter; the wine is confecrated on the altar in a wooden keg.

The truftees have, of late years, much abufed the founderâ€™s good intentions, by 
the moft rancorous quarrels and oppofitions to each other, in nominating a rnafter, 
whom they have bound under certain reftrhftions, perfectly incompatible with the 
donarâ€™s bequeft, and contrary to the common principles of juftice and equity.
They 
have reduced the ftipend to 81 .

There are many confufed ruins here, among others are thofe of a chapel, with 
a yard adjoining, in the middle of which is a large refervoir fupplied by a fine 
fpring: fome have conceived this was ufed for baprifm, when immerfion was 
pradlifed.
Over the door of this chapel are the arms of Blencowe cut in flone, 
a bend charged with three chaplets of rofes; different blazonings have been 
given, the proper oneÂ§ feems to be azure, the bend argent, gules the chaplets.

The granting of thefe armorial bearings is neceffary to be obferved.
It is gene- 
rally apprehended, that arms were uniformly derived from the fovercign only, 
but the following infiance, the firft that occurs in the courfe of this work, fliews 
that it was in the power of the barons to grant to their dependants, and thofe who 
held lands under their fee, armorial bearings at their will.

immediately following the battle of Poiftiers made him a grant of bis own arms, as Baron of Grayftock, 
to be thenceforth borne on a bend, conjoined with the paternal coat, as a monument to pofterity of the

This helps to explain the analogy that appears in the arms of many ancient families.

borrowed their coat armour from the lords of whom they held their Binds -in fee; others affirmed the

We think the following Journey over Caldbeck, Saddleback, and Soutcr Fells, 
with an account of a remarkable Ignis - ?aiuus t by Mr. Smith, whom we have 
often Quoted, deferving a place here : 
tf One curiofity is apt to excite another; after vifiting Crofs-fells,* my inclina- 
tions led me to examine thofe of Caldbeck, that later detachment of the Britifh 
Alps, which overfpreads great part of Cumberland, diftinguifhed by infuperable 
precipices and towering peaks, and exhibiting landfcapes of a quite different and 
more romantic air than any part of the general ridge, and of nearer affinity to the 
Switzerland Alps.
My intention in this journey w-as to vifit the Wad-Mines, the 
peculiar product of thefe mountains, and no where elfe difeovered on the globe ;f 
but as they are kept clofe fhut up, and the weather was extremely unfavourable, 
I deferred that examination to a more proper time, and contented myfelf with the 
varieties in the neighbourhood of Mofedale; here I found villages in the narrow 
bottoms, that feel no more benefit from the folar rays, for two months, about the 
winter fold ice, than the old Cimmerians, or the Laplanders, who inhabit about 
the north cape of Norw ay.
Svvinffed on Caldew is a ftrong inftance that the property of the artic circle is 
not confined to thofe unhappy regions which lie within tw'enty-three degrees of 
the pole, efpecially with regard to the folar light.
Thefe mountains differ not only in figure, but are very diffimilar in property to 
the main body, being dry, fmooth, and more agreeably verdant, where precipices 
occur not.
The rocks upon which they are built, being of a foffile abforbent na- 
ture, ferving to imbibe the defeending rains, w hich are thrown off from the more 
compadt firata of the general ridge, and take broken and uneven courfes through 
the loofe and fpungy texture of their outward covering, forming fometimes mo- 
raffes, but more frequently rotten bogs, and finuous mires of difficult paffage.
No 
fuch difagreeable objedts interrupt the traveller here ; if he guards againfl: the pre- 
cipices, he has no other danger to encounter.
The mod common plants which I obferved, are, Adianlhum nigrum qfficinarum s 
(of Ray) black maiden hair.
Lujula , acetoja fyhejlris , wood or mountain forrel.
Mujcus fquammofus montanus repens , Jabiiue folio.
* See page 263.

It is a received Cumberland proverb, that the mountains of Caldbeck are 
â€¢worth all England befides; but it has never yet been verified by experience; and, 
if we may be allowed to conjecture from the nature of their Rones found in the 
rivulets and quarries, it may be difficult to fay when they will.* Molt of their 
lapilli are a fluor of the ftaladlite kind, or a fparry talc refcmbling white flint, 
variegated with hexagonal cryflalline fpars, whofe points will cut glafs like the 
adamant; but immediately lofe that property, from their fragil quality.
Others 
are impregnated with the marcafite ol lead, but fo blended with an arfenical ful- 
phur, that they evaporate in the procefs of feparation; and others are of the cop- 
peras kind: all of them contained fuch heterogcncal qualities in their compolition, 
as never to yield a proper gratification for the trial.
Their quarries alfo only 
abound with a fiffile bluiih Rate, ufeful for the covering of their houfes, but very 
remote from the metalline nature: indeed, in Brandlegill beck, and the northern 
defeents, copper has been formerly dug, but the mines are long fince worn out : 
hereabouts the lapis calaminaris is alfo found.
Under mount Skiddaw is the head of the river Caldew ; it iffues through a 
narrow trough, and takes its winding courfe with great rapidity to Mofedale, 
where it turns northward for Carlifle.
Near two miles above that vilhme 
o 
(Mofedale) it receives a fmall rivulet from Boufcale tarn, a lake near a mile in 
circumference, on the fide of a high mountain, fo ftrangely furroumled with a 
more eminent amphitheatrical ridge of quarry rocks, that it is excluded the benefit 
of the fun for at leaf!
three months in the middle of winter ; but this is not its 
only Angularity.

that they frequently fee the liars in it at mid-day ; but, in order to difeover that

Thefe circumflances not occuring at the time I was there, deprived 
me of the pleafure of that fight, and of recommending it to the naturalifls upon 
my own occular evidence., which i regret the want of, as 1 queftion if the like has 
been any where elfe obferved.
The fpecflator mufl be fituated at leafl 200 yards 
above the lake, and as much below the fummit of the femi-ambient ridge; and, 
as there are other high mountains, which, in that pofilion, may break and deaden 
ihe folar rays, l can only give an implicit credit to the power of their agency,

till I am convinced of their effects, and am qualified to fend it better recommend- 
ed to the public.
At Grildale the water turns both ways ; fo that, in a fudden fhower, you may, 
with your foot only, fend the rain-water either to Carlifle or Cockermouth, by 
the channels of Caldew, or Lender-maken.
This laft fprings under Saddleback, 
a ParnalTian eminence, with two prominent peaks; the molt northerly is called 
f>lencarter, a furprifingly high precipice of the quarry kind.
Souter-fell is a difiinguifhed mountain of itfelf, encompaffed quite round with 
a turbinated trough, through which Lender-maken is conveyed.
The weft and 
north fides are barricadoed with rocks ; the eafi is more plain, but withal (deep, 
and feemingly 900 yards in height ; but every where of difficult accefs.
It was 
on this fell that the afionifhing phaenomenon appeared to exhibit itfcdf, which, in 
1735, 1737, and 1745, made fo much noife in the north, that I went on purpofe 
to examine the fpeffators, who afferted the faff, and continue in their affertion 
very pofitively to this day.
On Midfummer eve, 1735, William Lancafierâ€™s fervant related, that he faw the 
eafi fide of Souter-fell, towards the top, covered with a regular marching army 
for above an hour together ; he faid they confifted of diftinff bodies of troops, 
which appeared to proceed from an eminence in the north end, and marched over 
a niche in the top, (marked A and B in the place) but, as no other perfon in 
the neighbourhood had feen the like, he was diferedited and laughed at.
Two 
years after, on Midfummer eve alfo, betwixt the hours of eight and nine, William 
Lancafter himfelf imagined that feveral gentlemen were following their horfes at 
a difiance, as if they had been hunting, and taking them for fuch, he paid no regard 
to it, till about ren minutes after, again turning his head towards the place, they 
appeared to be mounted, and a vaft army following, five in rank, crowding over 
at the fame place where the fervant faid he faw them two years before.
He then 
called his family, who all agreed in the fame opinion ; and, what was moft extra- 
ordinary, he frequently obferved that fome one of the five would quit rank, and 
feem to hand in a fronting pofiurc, as if he was obferving and regulating the 
order of their march, or taking account of their numbers, and, after fome rime, 
appeared to return full gallop to the Ration he had left, which they never failed to 
do as often as they quitted their lines ; and the figure that did fo was generally 
one of the middlemoft men in the rank.
As it grew later, they feemed more re- 
gardlefs of difeipline, and rather had the appearance of people riding from a 
market, than an army ; though they continued crow'ding on, and marching off, fo 
long as they had light to fee them.
This phaenomenon was no more feen till the Midfummer eve which preceded the 
rebellion, when they were determined to call more families to be witnefs of this 
fight, and accordingly went to Wilron-hill and Souter-fell fide, till they convened 
about 26 perfons, who all affirm they then faw the fame appearance, but not con- 
duffed with the ufual regularity as the preceding ones, having the likenefs of 
carriages interfperied; how ever, it did not appear to be lefs real ; for fome of the 
company were fo affVffed w ith it, as, in the morning, to climb the mountain, 
through an idle expectation of fin; ling hoik llioes after fo numerous an army; but 
faw not the vcltige or print of a foot.

William Lancafler, indeed, told me, that he never concluded they were real 
beings, becaufe of the impracticability of a march over the precipices, where they 
feemed to come on; that the night was extremely ferene; that horfe a n d rnan, 
upon ftriCt looking at, appeared to be but one being, rather than two difl'nct ones; 
that they were nothing like any clouds or vapours which he had evei perceived 
elfewhere ; that their number was incredible, for they filled lengthways near half 
a mile, and continued fo in a fwift march for above an hour, and much longer, he 
thinks, if night had kept off.
The whole (lory has fo much the air of a romance, that it feemed fitter for 
Amadis de Gaul , or Glenville' s Syftem of Witches, than the repofitory of the learned ; 
but, as the country was full of it, I only give it verbatim from the original relation 
of a people that could have no end in impoling on their fellow-creatures, and are 
of good repute in the place where they live.
It is my real opinion, that they apprehended they faw fuch appearances ; but 
how an undulating lambent meteor could affect the optics of many people, is dif- 
ficult to fay.
No doubt fancy will extend to miraculous heights in perfons difpofed 
to indulge it ; and whether there might not be a concurrence of that to afTift the 
vapour, I will not difpute, becaufe three difficulties feem to occur worthy of fo- 
iution :f 
iff.
Why a lambent agitated meteor fhould appear to flop at certain intervals, 
and return with augmented velocity to re-afTume the forfaken place.
2d, Why it fhould, for a very long time, preferve fo regular a fyftem, as to ap- 
pear ffill five in a line.
3d, Why one particular evening in the year only exhibited the unufual meteor 
for three times, at fo long intervals.
As thefe are at prefent beyond rny philofophy to explain, it may be an amufe- 
ment to fuch as will give themfelves the trouble of enquiry, having neither added 
nor dirninifhed to the accounts given me.
Thofe who treat it as a mere lllulion, 
or deceptio vifus , fhould affign reafons for fo large a fafeination in above 20 per- 
fons; probably one, indeed, might ferve to aggrandize the fancy of others ; but I 
fhould think they could not be fo univerfally deceived, without fome ftamina of 
the likenefs exhibited on the mountain from a meteor, or fome unknown caufe.
It is fingularly remarkable, that mod of all thefe mountains have their pi bcipices 
fronting the weft aid northweft, which is a flrong collateral proof of the earthâ€™s 
motion, becaufe the diurnal revolution would naturally throw off all the loofe 
ftrata in its fluid ftate to the oppofite quarter, and the concurring fuftrage of tra- 
vellers in the fame properties of foreign mountans, where reafons are not obvious 
for their being otherwife, much ftrengthens the argument.â€ 
Mr. Clarke has corroborated the circumftances of this account, by adding, that 
Daniel Stricket, who fiift obferved the fpe&acle, at the time of Mr. Clarkeâ€™s 
f To this relation we may add, that, in the fpring of the year 1707, early in a ferene ftill morning, 
was obferved, by two perfons, one ot the name of Churchill, who were walking from one village to 
another in Leicefterfhire, a like appearance in an army marching along, till, going behind a great hill, it

THRELKELD.
1 laving croffed the brook at Lamb bridge, near the eleventh mile poll, we 
entered the manor of Threlkeld.
Here is a chapelry under Gray flock, and the 
manor is within that barony.
â€” A family of this name were refident here in the 
time of King Edward I.
who alfo poffefied Yanwath-Hall, a caftellated houfe, near 
to Penrith : the Threikelds fell into female lffue about the beginning of the reign 
of (bueen Elizabeth, and the property was divided to three coheirefTes ;f one 
married Thomas Dudley, and took the Yanwath ellate ; another married James 
Pic kering, and took Crofby Ravenfworth, in Weftmorland; and the third married 
William, the brother of James Pickering, and had Threlkeld.
Tnefe Pickerings 
were fons of Sir James Pickering, of Killmgton, in Weflmorland.
Threlkeld, 
after palling by marriage to the family of Irtons, came to the Speddings, of 
Armathwaite.
The manor was fold to Lord Lonfdaleâ€™s anceftor; who, in June, 
1635, for the fum of 1360I.
relieved the tenants from the diflrefsfui burthen of 
their fervile tenure, a fine arbitrary, accepting a fourpenny fine certain: there were 
then thirty-nine cuflomary tenants and eight cottagers who compounded.

Of the fervices which then remained uncompounded 
for, about thirty years ago feveral of the tenants received a leafe, on payment of 
five guineas each, except the miln fervice, which remains undiffolved.
The fer- 
vices for each tenant were half a draught for one day ploughing, one day mowing, 
one day (hearing, one day clipping, and one day falving flieep ; one carriage load 
once in two years, but not to go above ten miles ; to dig and lead two loads of 
peats every year, the tenants to have their mefs, or, as it is called in the ancient 
fervices of the neighbouring counties, their c rowdy , whilfl they ferved.
The cot- 
tagers were to perform the like fervices, only for half a plough they found a horfe 
with a harrow, a footman inflead of a carriage load.

of his almoll unparalleled eccentricity of character, but for his extraordinary attain-

He wasthe fon of Alexander Nnughley, an epâ€™fcopal clergyman of reputation at Stow, in the Lothian?, 
â€¢where this fon was born, a few years t efore the revolution.
The father was highly refpcftable for his 
learning and piety ; and had been chum with Bifhop Burnet at the univerfity of Glafgow.
But, refuling, 
from confcientious motives, to fign the covenant, and fiding with the Marquis of Montrofe, he was de- 
pofed, and banifhed.
Another brother, and this Alexander, then a mere infant, were put into a pair of 
panniers, and thus conveyed, on a little Scots galloway, to this place : the father and mother performing 
the journey on foot.
The {Upend of l hrelkeld, though too fmali to maintain a refident miniiler, to this

enabled, through rigid fiugality, after having taught this his fon, with great advantage, all that >s ufually 
called fchool learning, to fend him to the univerfity of Edinburgh ; where he {laid till he took his mafterâ€™s 
degree.
At this feminary, he diilinguifhed himfelf, particularly for his proficiency in mathematical 
learning.
Soon after his return to Threlkeld, the father d ed; and contented to fticceed him, the parifhtoners were 
happy to cleft the fon.
Here he remained hfty one years, without ever leeking, or accepting, of any 
other promotion : for, here alone, as he uled to fay, lie was in his element ; becaufe his peculiarities did 
not at all diminifh the refpeCt paid him by his parifhioneis.
For many years, he added fomething, but it 
never could be much to his church revenue of 12I.

SADDLEBACK.
423 
A friend his indulged us with the following defer iption of his view of 
Saddleback, and the curious crater and lake there, where the lava of a volcano is 
unqueftionably to be found in large quantities:* â€” his tour was made in 17 93.
He (peaks with great refped;, in the firft indance, of one Mr. John Graves, 
who gave him the earlied defeription of thofe feenes, and excited his curiofity to 
vifit them ; and of Mr. Thomas Clement, a reddent of the fkirts of the mountain, 
who attended him and his party on the view.
It was remarked to our friend, that 
travellers who made the tour of the lakes generally vidted Skiddavv, and left 
Saddleback unexplored ; whence they might indulge the eye with as extendve and 
pleadng profpedfs, as they could by afeending the fider mountain; beddes the 
curious view of Scales Tarn, which is herein after deferibed.
â€” Lie adds, he had, 
at fomc dillant time, feen Scales Tarn deferibed in fome periodical publication, 
but diligent fearch had not reftored the defeription to him.
â€” He fays Mr. Clement 
lives about a mile and a.
half eaffward of Threlkcld, at the foot of the mountain, 
from whofe houfe the party proceeded about one oâ€™clock, p.
m. â€” That they made 
their palfage in an oblique diredtion up that part which is called Scales-fell: and 
he proceeds in his defeription thus : â€” â€œ When we had afeended about a mile, one 
â€œ of the party, on looking round, was fo aftonifhed with the different appearance 
â€œ of objecls in the valley, fo far beneath us, that he declined proceeding.
We had 
** not gone much further, till the other companion (of the relator), was fuddenly 
â€œ taken ill, and wifhed to lofe blood, and return.
I w-as almoff ready (adds he) to 
â€œ give up my project, which I fhould have done with great reluctance, as the day 
<r was remarkably favourable, and exhibited every feene to the greateff advantage.
â€œ Mr. Clement allured us, if we proceeded a little way, we fhould find a refting 
this way were performed.
His mod ufual fare, was a cruft, of four brown bread, boiled in plain v/ater, 
and fealoned with a little fait : and the only luxuries in diet, on which he was ever known to regale with 
fuperior enjoyment, were meffes of oatmeal.
His drefs was only comparable to bis diet : it was, in ge- 
neral, the meaneft and vvovft in the parifh.
He always wore wooden Ihces, and went without cravat, 
ftock, or handkerchief round his neck : his fiovenlinefs will not bear defeription.
His hearth was feldom 
cleared of the embers ; whilft his whole apartment was ftrewed over with books and papers, intermingled 
with his houfehold implements.
The moll extraordinary circumftance of his life, was, an aft of abfeifion, which he performed under 
fome fad ftate o f mind.
What his real motives were, is not known, he having refilled the moll importu- 
nate inquiries of his friends ; contenting himfelf, in general, on fuch occafions, with a reference to the 
text in St. Matt.

On his being hard preffed, by a man of good abilities, who alfo was as fond 
of ale and argumentation as Naughley himfelf, for the interpretations ufually given to that text, Naughley 
peeviihiy, but figuificantly, replied â€” â€œ Well, at any rate, it is better to be fo, than to go mad.â€ The 
expredion ftruck the hiogtapher, who was prefent, as meaning more than met the ear.
We do not know, that ever the fubjeft of thefe brief memoirs lived to repent of his ralh deed ; fo that 
he could have faid with Atys, to whom Catullus has addrelfed a beautiful poem on this very fubjeft : 
â€œ Jam jam dolet quod egi, jam jamque panitet.â€ 
After this aft of felf-violence, he became fottilh, grovelling, and mean in the extreme ; unftudious, and 
without either ambition or effort to improve his underftanding.
His voice alfo was rendered fo effemi- 
nate, weak, and piping, that his congregation, even when they could hear him at all, no longer heard 
him with pleafure.
He died in 1756, at the age of 76 ; and was fucceeded by the prefent woithy and

* c place, where the fecond defaulter of our party might recover the effedts of his 
tc journey.
After labouring another half hour, we gained the margin of an im- 
u menfe cavity, in the fide of the mountain, the bottom of which formed a wide 
** bafon, and was filled with water, that from our fiarion looked black, though fmooth 
* c as glafs, covering the fpace of feveral acres.
f It is faid to be fo deep, that the 
<( fun never lhâ€™rnes upon it, and that the reflection of the Bars rnay be feen therein 
â€œ at noon-day ; but that was a curiofity we did not enjoy.
From our fiaticn there 
** was a gentle declivity to a fmooth and verdant lawn, feveral yards in breadth, 
** which was the fituation our guide had promifed us ; and the defeent thereto led 
" us about half way to the lake : a like eafy defeent would have led us to the edge of 
â€œ the lake, round which there appeared a broad green walk; but our leader 
<c informing us of the danger of pairing that flippery path, wc did not proceed.
ft We now contemplated the feene with awe-ftruck wonder.
We flood diredtly 
â€œ facing the middle of the mountain, the form of which gives it the name of 
â€œ Saddleback : and to the lake, a perpendicular rocky precipice prefented itfelf, 
extending to the north-eaft fide of the mountain called Foul-cragg.
To the 
** right hand, the fleepnels of the rocks gradually declined ; above us, and on the 
" left, they were flupendous and perpendicular; fo that in one half of the circle 
<f the rocks are lofty and precipitous, whilit in the other half they gradually de- 
â€œ creafed.
My fellow traveller wouly proceed no further, and, with my guide, I 
,c was left to explore the other parts of the mountain.
Winding round, and 
u keeping the cavity on our right, we attained the ridge or fummit of the rock, 
" where we found a paflage three or four yards broad : on the right, the defeent to 
u the lake looked truly awful ; whilfl the fteep rocks on the other fide were lofty, 
u and not to be climbed by human fieps.
This paflage, fome hundred yards in 
" length, may be compared to a bridge covered with grafs.
Having reached the 
â€œ fummit, we went to the point nearefl to Kefwick vale, and there enjoyed a moft 
u delightful profpeft ; from thence we pafied to the next point, being Foul-era ?g t 
,c with Skiddaw on the left ; from whence we looked down into a dreadful a by is, 
tl the bottom of which the eye could not penetrate: fheep frequently perifh in 
â€œ this place, as the number of dead carcafles and fkeletons evinced.
â€” We walked 
r< back by the fide next to the lake, but to look down from thence was fo terrible, I 
â€™*Â« could not endure it a moment.
We perceived from thence, that my companion, 
** whom we had laft left, was laid upon the ground ; I preifed the guide to haften 
** to him, but he refilled, alledging, that a fog was rifing, and it would be very 
â€œ hazardous for me to explore my way alone down the mountain: in a fhort time 
" we were enveloped in a very denfe vapour, fo that we were obliged to keep near 
" to each other ; the fudden change was almoft incredible.
It was with difficulty 
â€œ my guide regained the paflage, or dry-bridge, which we miffed on feveral 
M attempts; and one incautious flep would have plunged us in the horrid abyfs.

â€œ wonderful precipices from their bafe ; and again fafely reached Mr. Clementâ€™s 
â€œ houfe, after a laborious travel of four hours.
â€œ On the lide of the mountain we found feveral large plots of the Lycopodium 
â€œ Clavatum , or club-mofs ; the creeping branches of which were clofely matted 
â€œ and interwoven, and formed a carpet, that feemed to furpafs the workmanfhip 
â€œ of the fineft artifts.â€ 
Our correfpondent adds â€” â€œ On an excurfion laft fummer, I went to view Skiddaw, 
â€œ and that I might have the profpeds in their utmoft grandeur, I reached the 
â€œ higheft point of the mountain at four oâ€™clock in the morning when the fun was 
â€œ riling ; the air was calm and ferene, and I enjoyed the view of the magnificent 
â€œ fcenery around me for near an hour.
â€” So many writers have given defcriptions 
â€œ of their paiTage, and the fcenery around Skiddaw, that I forbear adding thereto : 
â€œ but muft repeat, that Saddleback, in refpedt to curiofity, will afford the traveller 
*â€¢ more fat is fad ion.â€ 
In Mr. Clarkeâ€™s Survey of the Lakes, there is an account of the mountain 
of Saddleback, faid to have been received from a Mr. Crosfield.
â€” Speaking of 
Mr. Greyâ€™s negled of the ftupendous fcenery here, Mr. Clarke makes the follow- 
ing apology â€” â€œ His tender, melancholy, and delicate mufe, delighted to fport in 
â€œ funny vales ; or to recline under the {hade of the fpreading oak.
lifieningto the 
â€œ warbling of the feathered choir over his head, or the tinkling of the ftream that 
â€œ ran purling at his feet.â€ â€” It is related, that the lake before-mentioned had excited 
Mr. Crosfieldâ€™s curiofity, and he determined to examine the adjacent parts, and 
there found â€œ vetrified lumps, refenibling glafs-houfe flags, in fome places lying 
â€œ loofe, in others evidently fitted by fufhion to the crevices and irregularities of 
â€œ the fiones among which they lay.
Likewife many large blocks of ftone, inter- 
â€œ mixed with marcafite, in fuch plenty, as to be inflammable; in other places there 
" was a firatum of matter, a foot or more in thicknefs, which lay upon the rocks, 
â€œ and feemed to have undergone a great degree of heat.â€ Thefe appearances 
induced him to climb the mountain.
His road led obliquely along the fide of Souter-fell , the whole of which rc- 
fembles a mafs of rubbifh ; the top of that fell he reckoned the firfl landing place, 
compofed of loofe fragments of fione, intermixed with detached lumps of quartz 
and thillas.
The top of Scales-fell he calls the fecond landing place : â€œ Here, (he 
â€œ fays) he came to the brink of the firfl of thole hideous chafms which follow the 
â€œ fouthern face of this mountain.â€ â€” â€œ This firfl chafm, though by far the leaft 
â€œ formidable, is inconceivably horrid; its width is about two hundred yards, and 
â€œ its depth at leaf!
fix hundred: after a fieep and painful afcent of about a mile, I 
â€œ came to the brink of the other gulphs.
Here a point of the mountain juts out 
â€œ like the angle of a baflion, between two of thefe horrid abyfles.
I flood upon 
â€œ this, and had on each fide a gulph about two hundred yards wide, and at leafl: 
â€œeight hundred deep; their fides were.
rocky, bare, and rough, fcarcely the 
â€œ appearance of vegetation upon them ; and their bottoms were covered with 
â€œ pointed broken rocks.
Paffing this, I arrived at the fartheft point, where 
â€œ the mountain has every appearance of being fplit ; and at the bottom I faw hills 
â€œ about forty yards high, and a mile in length, which feem to have been raifed

â€œ from the rubbifh that has fallen from the mountain.
From hence I went to the 
â€œ fummit, where I could fee the tarn, which, as I was elevated upwards of two* 
â€œ hundred yards above it, appeared very fmali : here likewife 1 had a moft beau- 
44 tiful view' of the country for many miles round, and could not help obferving, 
44 that the back of this mountain is as remarkably fmooth, as its front is horrid.
â€œ I then defcended towards the tarn, which is an oval piece of water, about two 
â€œ hundred yards from eaff to weft, and about an hundred and fifty from north to 
â€œ foutâ€™n : it is furrounded by rocks, except an opening towards the eaft, where they 
â€œ have been evidently broken down.
Standing near this opening, I difcharged my 
44 gun, when the echo was inconceivable.â€ 
He then proceeds to relate, that he lent the minerals which he then collected to 
Dr. Black, Profeffor of Chemiftry at Edinburgh: and he draws this conclufion, 
that the mountain had formerly been in a volcanic ftate, and that this tarn had been- 
the mouth or crater of the mountain.
Mr. Clarke adds- â€” That on the fouth fide, above a place called High- Row, and 
in fome other parts, trials have been made for minerals, but at what time, and with 
what fuccefs, there is no tradition : he went into one of the levels, and found the 
works had been carried on previous to the ufe of gunpowder, as there were no 
other marks but of picks and wedges.
That at the forge below Felljide , there is- 
a lubterraneous palfage cut through the rock; w here no other means than the 
work of picks and wedges has been ufed.
Camden mentions copper mines

* Jofeph Browne, D D.
late Provoft cf Queenâ€™s College, Oxford, was born at a place called the Tongue, 
in Watermillock, in the year I 700, and was baptized the 19th of December, in that year.
His father, 
George Browe was a reputable yeoman but not of much property as we know only of a fmali tenement, 
he pcfTefTed in the chapelry of Newkirk, in the parilh of Grayitock.
Being induftrious, howevei, and 
frugal, he was enabled to give his for.
a claflical education at Barton fchool ; and after he had laid a good 
foundation of learning there, to fend him to Queenâ€™s College, where he was admitted a member on the 
22d day of March, 1716-7.
It was probably at Barton fchool that he formed an intimacy with the 
late Edward Haffel, Efquire of Dalemain : their friendlhip was conxinued and fixed, by their being af- 
terwards fellow collegians ; and there is a tradition, that he was allifted in the expence of his education 
by the beneficence of the Dalemain family.
At the univerfity, his good behaviour and rapid progrefs in knowledge, procured him many friend* 
that were of great fervice to him.
In due time he was elctled Taberdar upon the foundation ; and having- 
gone through that office with honour, he took the degree of A.
M. Nov. 4th, 1724, and was chofeiv 
one of the chaplains of the cojlege.
Not long after this, he publilhed, from the univerfity prefs, a fplendid.
edition of all the Latin poems of Maphseus Barberinus, or Pope Urban the VIII, with an elegant dedi- 
cation to Edward Haffel, Efq. his great friend and patron.
On the fit ft of April, 1731, he was elefted Fellow, and became an eminent tutor, having feveral young 
noblemen of the firft rank entrufted to his care.
In this ufeful and important ftation he continued many 
years, exercifing ftriÂ£t difeipline, and afiiduonfly ftudying to promote the profperity of the college.
He 
took the degree of D.
D. July the 9th, 1 743, and was prefented by the provoft and fociety to the redlory 
of Bramlhot in Hampfhire, May ift, 1746.
The univeifity conferred upon him the profefforfhip of 
Natural Philofophy in 17+7, which he held till his death, and was fucceeded in it by the late Dr. Ben- 
jamin Wheeler.
At his living at Bramlhot, he refided more than ten years ; during which time he was collated to the 
chancellorlhip of Hereford, and was made a Canon Refidentiary, by the Right Honourable and Right 
Reverend Lord James Beauclerk, Bilhop of that diocefe, who had formerly been his pupil.

Upon the death of Dr. Smith, provoft of Queenâ€™s college, November 23d, 1756, Dr. Browne offered 
himfelf a candidate for the Headfhip, and had for his formidable competitor, the Revered George Fo.
thergill, D.
D. principal of Edmund Hall, who had likewife been Fellow of the college, and an eminent 
tutor, and was a perfon univerfally efteemed.
The eledlion lafted three days, and each candidate having, 
upon every dayâ€™s ferutiny, an equality of votes, both among the fenior and junior Fellows, Dr. Browns 
being the fenior candidate, was (as the ftatute directs) declared duly elefted provoft.
This conteft made 
no difagreement between the two competitors, they lived in the fame harmony and friendfhip as before.
In the year 1759, Dr. Browne was appointed Vice chancellor of the univerfity, which arduous office 
together with that of his Headfhip, he managed with great ability and prudence, till the 25th of March 
1765 ; on the evening of which day, he received a levere ftroke of the palfy, which rendered him utterly 
incapable of bufinefs.
Under that calamity he languilhed till the 1 7th of June, J 767, and then died, leaving behind him the 
charafter of being a well-bred man, a polite as well as a profo md fcholar, an agreeable companion, and 
a ftcady friend.
There was a gravity and authority in his looks and deportment, that reflected dignity 
upon the public offices he fuftained.
He continued Vice Chancellor an unufual length of time, and 
prefided at the memorable Fnccenia when the Earl of Litchfield was inftalled.

Part of Ullfwater lies within this county, terminating where Glencoinf beck 
or rivulet empties ltfelf into the lake.
We have already trefpalfed greatly on the partial rule of confining our hiftory 
rigidly to the limits of the county; having ftepped over the boundary, where we 
apprehended we could procure either amufement or information to our reader#: â€” 
in our further progrefs we ihall prefume to take the fame liberty, when we have 
the like objeds in view.
The road which leads from Amblefide, in Weftmorland, to Ullfwater, is a truly 
alpine pafs, near the fummits of the mountains, dreary and defolate.
Some Hones 
near the road are called Kirkftones :* but they did not appear to us to be the re- 
mains of any druidical work; nor in their figure, or otherwife, to point out any 
particular caufe for their name.Â§ We took a (hort repaft at a little public houfc

to his Grace the Duke of Norfolk) confiding only of three cuftomary tenements, of the annual rent of

a twenty -penny fine on the death of lord or tenant, and a thirty-penny fine on alienation.
The 
wood, with a fifhery, are free, paying an annual quit-rent of two marks.
One Harrifon who poflefled 
Glencoin, wafted it in fruitlefs law fuits, contending with the lord of Grayftock, an Ant/eus in the 
conflict.
It was purchafed by one Graves, who greatly improved it value, and it continues the pofleffion 
of one of his defendants : â€”

â€œ Rough quarries, rocks, and hills, whofe heads touch heaven,

Shakespeareâ€™s Othello,

â€œ Sure thefe grand rocks, from whofe tremendous height 
â€œ I fee the big fwoln clouds below 
â€œ More than a work of chance to reafon ftiow ; 
â€œ For wifdomâ€™s eye muft know,

â€œ Such order, beauty, majefty to flow.
â€œAt whofe but his command 
â€œ Could waters fpread, vales fink, and mountains rife, 
â€œ In forms like thefe, beneath the vaulted ikies ?â€ 
^ From Hartfop Highfield, on the defeent from Kirkftone, is a very grand view, enlivened by the 
palling of the numerous workmen, who are employed in the flate quarries, and who, in a Angular mariner, 
bring down the flates by drawing a fledge ; there is great difficulty in contriving to impede the velocity 
of the fledge, with a load of about 5 cwt.
from over-running its condudlor, and carrying him headlong 
down the precipice.
The hills furrounding this lake are moftly formed of argillaceous ftone ; no calcareous earth or limc- 
ftone being near it, except on Barton-fell.

Though, on the fummit of a hill, near Helvellyn, is a ftratum of flint, the

That regularity of ftrata of different kinds of ftone,

There is one curious fpeftacle often obferved by the flrephera on the fummit of the mountains, which

Beattieâ€™s Minstrel.
As we defeended the narrow vale, a heavy and dark vapour rolled over the fummits of the mountains, 
which were ftupendous, and the funbeanrs painted the diftant valley, thus proceeding 
â€œ Through woods, and mountains wild, we came at laft 
â€œ Into a pleafant vale, that lonely lay 
â€œ Betwixt two hills, whofe high heads overplaced,

Spencer, 
This little river, called Goldrill beck , iffues from a fmall lake, embofomed in mountains, called Broad 
Water, by others Brother Water, from two brothers being drowned in it; â€” and, what is Angular, a 
fimilar accident occurred about feven years ago.

But 
there is no hiftorical foundation for the prefumption that Ulphus had pofiefiions 
here.
The conjecture, that the name is derived from Wolf' s -water, is lomewhat 
more probable, as the afpedt of the environs of the lake every where encourages 
the idea, that this was the refort of wolves for ages.

â– f There are not many perfons, either curates or others, who have parted through a long life, deferving 
cither a more flriking, or a more truly honourable chara&er.
It has been alledgâ€™ed, that this provident

fchool, which brought him in about five pounds a-year ; add to this, that his wife was a Ikilful midwife.
Patterdale is luppofed to take its name from St. Patrick ; and as the church is dedicated to that faint, 
it is reafonable to fuppofe the prefent name is a corruption of St. Patrickâ€™s dale, merely from the 
dedication.
There is no mention made of St. Patrickâ€™s being in Cumberland, or the north of England, on his 
journey fiom Ireland, in the Carta Sand Patricii, which makes a part of the wooden tablet (mentioned 
in page 137.) preferved at Naworth Caftle.
|| Or, it is il ill more probably derived from- the Celtic Ulle, (whence the Latin Ullna ) the bend of the- 
elbow, which is no inaccurate defeription of the form of the lake.

Matterdale , (which poflibly may be derived from the Celtic Mat hair, a' fountain 
and fo import a dale or dell of fprings or Rreams) lies on the boundary of 
Cumberland, and is within the extenfive parifh of Grayfiock, otherw ife written 
Greyfioke.l| In Gowbarrow Park there is a fine waterfall, wholly unafiified by 
art; the ftream breaks from the fummit of a cliff, cloathed wfith wood, and falls 
precipitately through a black rocky gully near eighty perpendicular feet in height, 
and fixteenth in wddth.
By fome it is called Airey Force , which lafi is the com- 
mon and ufual appellation for a fall of water.
When fianding near this and other

The

The prefent Duke of Norfolk has built a pleafant fummer retreat in this part, 
to which he gives the name of Lyulphâ€™s tower.
No hifiory feems to fupport this 
name, and the tradition of Lyulphâ€™s pofTeflions here, who was the dependant of 
Walcher, Bifhopof Durham, feems to be as vague, as fancy could conceive.

There are about 2000 acres within 
the bounds of the park, ftocked with fix or feven hundred head of fallow deer.
Tradition fays, that fome part of the park was formerly doled out to the tenants

fpeaks of an old church which Rood within this park, and that he poflefled an

Gowbarrow-hall, and part of a tenement at Old Church ; that it fpecified that the

He adds, that 
the chapel was deftroyed on an incurfion of the Scots, and a new one was ereded

memorandum in an old Bible) by Bifliop Oglethorp, when on his road to crown 
Queen Elizabeth.

This manor is a member ot the barony of Grayfiock, 
and includes certain lands in Thackth wane, whofe cuftomary fervice is to repair 
the mill race, for which the tenants are to receive from the miller, a pot of ale and 
a penny worth of tobacco ; by an old inquifition it is Rated, that the pot of ale

The north-

At the

â€œ The foreground of the grand view before us, is part of Go vi barrow park,

Among

Be-

â€œ or Place Fell; the fouthern bounoary of the like.â€ â€œ Such was the difpofition 
<f of the objects on the left of the lake; on the right, two woody promontories 
Â«* purfuing each other in perfpedive, made a beautiful contraft, with the fmooth

of Patterdale.
As we left Gowbarrow park, we took our route along the margin of the firft 
Cf of thofe woody promontories on the right.
We were carried by the fide of the 
Cf lake, through clofe lanes and thick groves; yet not fo thick, but that we had 
<f every where, through the openings of the trees, and windings of the road, views in 
" front, and on the right, into woody rcceftes, fome of which w'ere very pleafing : 
<c and on the left, the lake and all its diftineft furniture, broke frequently upon us.
ct After fkirting the firft woody promontory, which carried us about a mile, 
â€œ the road turned fuddenly to the right, and led us round into the fecond, riling 
" a confiderable height above the water.
In this promontory, a new feene open-

(C accompany all lakes, that are circumft ribed by lofty and rocky fkreens.
We

Such a variety of awful founds, mixing, and commixing,

But there is another fpecies of echoes, which are well adapted to the lake,

fo many publications to guide the traveller to favourite points of view, that the 
hiftoric pen mud refer to them, and truft to the deferiptions of thofe gen- 
tlemen who have, perhaps not more lavifiily than truly, fpoken of the varying 
beauties of thefe feenes.
of the water till you gain the fummit, when the view is uncommonly beautiful.
You look down ?t once 
upon the flieet of the lake, which appears pvodigioufly fine.
It is an oblong water, cut by iftauds, three 
miles long, and a mile and a half broad in fotne places, in others a mile.
It is inclofcd within an amphi- 
theatre of hills in front, at the end of the reach, projecting down to the waterâ€™s edge, but retiring from it 
on each fide, fo as to leave a fpace of cultivated inclofures between the feet and the lake.
The hedges 
that divide them are fcattered with trees; and the fields, of both grafs and corn, waving in beautiful floper 
from the water, interfered by hedges in the moll pidlurefque manner.
Upon the right, a bold fwelling hill of turf rifes with a fine air of grandeur.
Another view from oft 
this hill is on a mountainâ€™s fide, which prefents to the eye a fwelling Hope of turf, and over it Saddle- 
back rifes in a noble ftile.
Another view from this hill, is down upon a beautiful vale of cultivated inclo- 
fures; Mr. Haffelâ€™s houfe at Dalemain, in one part almoft encorr.paffed with a plantation.
Here you 
likewife catch fome meanders of the river, through the trees, and hear the roar of a water-fall.
This hill 
is itfelf a very fine objeft, viewed every way; but the fimplicity of its effedl is deftroyed, by being cut by 
a double ftripe of Scotch firs acrofs it, which varies the colour of the verdure, and confequently breaks the.
unity of the view.
Another point cf view, from which this pait of the lake is feen to good advantage, is 
from off Soulby Fell: you look down upon the water, which fpreads very finely to the view, bounded 
to the right by the hills, which rife from the very water; at the other by Dunmanlot hill; in front by a 
fine range of inclofures, rifiag moil beautifully to the view, and the waterâ€™s edge fkirted by trees, in a rr.oft 
pi&urefque manner.
Direftir.g your courfe under the lake, and landing at Swartk Fell, the next bufinefs fhould be to 
mount its height.
The lake winds at your feet like a noble river ; the oppofite banks beautiful inclo- 
fures, exquifitely fringed with trees; and fome narrow flips, like promontories, jet into it in the mofi 
pidlurefque effedl imaginable; and at the fame time you hear the noife of a water-fall beneath, but unfeen.
Taking boat again, and failing with the courfe of the lake, you turn with its bend, and come into a very 
fine fheet of water, which appears like a lake of itfelf.
It is under FJowtown and Hawltkg Fell.
The environs here are very ftriking ; cultivated inclofures on one fide, crowned with the tops of hills, and 
on the other, a woody cr3ggy hill down to the very waterâ€™s edge.
The cffedl fine.
Next you double Hawhng Fell, and come again into a new fheet cf water under Maitindale Fell, 
which is a prodigious fine hill, of a bold, abrupt form ; and between that and Hawling Fell, a little rifing 
wave of cultivated inclofures, fkirted with trees, the fields of the fineft verdure, and the pielurefque appear- 
ance of the whole, moll exquifitely pleafing.
It is a moll delicious fpot, within an amphitheatre of rugged 
hills.
Following the bend of water under New Crag, the views' are more romantic than in any part hitherto 
feen.
New Crag, to the right, rears a bold, abrupt head, in a ilile truly fublime; and palling it a little, 
the oppofite fhore is very' noble.
Maitindale Fell rifes fleep from the waterâ€™s edge, and prefents a bold 
wall of mountain; really glorious.
In front, the hills are craggy, broken, and irregular in fhape (not 
height (like thofe of Kefwick.
They projedl fo boldly to the very water, that the out-let or winding of the 
water, is fhut by them from the eye.
It feems inclofed by r a fhore of fleep hills and crags.
From hence 
to the end of the lake, which is fprinkled by three or four fmall iflands, the views are in the fame ftile, 
very wild and romantic.
It is an exceedingly pleafing entertainment to fail about this fine lake, which is nineteen miles round, 
and prefents to the eye feveral very fine fheets of water; and abounds, for another amufement, with noble 
fifh ; pike to 3olb.
perch to 6lb.
trout to 61b.
befides many other forts.
The water is of a moft 
beautiful colour, and admirably tranfparent.â€ â€” â€” A.

ULLS WATER.
[Leath Ward.
At the foot of the lake, near the fummit of one of the hills of Soulby-Fell, on 
the fouthern declination, is an ancient fort or encampment, called Caer-Tbannock: 
the country people give it the name of Maiden Caflle.
It forms an oblong fquare, 
twenty paces in length, and fifteen in breadth ; this is furrounded with a circular 
mound of earth, eighty paces in diameter, defended by a ditch on the outfide, 
which remains fix paces wide.
We do not find this fortification, or .that on 
Dunmallet, noticed by any of our hiftorians.
Caer-Thannock feems more calcu- 
lated for concealment than defence, being overlooked by two adjoining eminences, 
and lying under a gradual defcent of the hill where it is placed.
The length of this lake, by land, is eight miles and three quarters; by water, 
only eight miles and one quarter, it contains 2563 acres when the water is low, 
which gives the mean breadth to be near half a mile.
At the lowed bend, the 
lake is not above thirty yards in depth ; near Place-Fell and the inlands, it is j 30- 
yards deep.
Mr. Gilpin fays, â€œ There is an appearance on the furfaces of lakes, which wc 
â€œ cannot account for on any principle, either of optics, or of perfpecfrive.
When 
â€œ there is no apparent caufe in the Jky, the water will fometimes appear dappled- 
cc with large fpots of {hade.
It is pofiible thefe patches may have connection with 
â€œ the bottom of the lake; as natural ids fuppofe, the fhining parts of the fea are 
Â« f occafioned by the fpawn of fidi; but this is more probable, that in fome way they 
â€œ are connected with the Iky, as they are generally in the country edcemed to be a 
â‚¬t weather-gage.
The people will often fay, â€œ It will be no hay-day to-day, the lake 
Â« f is full of fhades.â€ â€” I never, myfelf, faw this appearance, or I might be able to 
* f give a better account of it; but I have heard it fo often taken notice of, that I fup- 
â€œ pofe there is at lead fome ground for the obfervation.
Though, after all, I think 
it probable thefe fhades may be owing only to floating clouds.
I have often, 
â€œ fays Mr. Locke, remarked this appearance on the lake of Geneva, without being 
â€œ able to affign a fatisfaftory reafon : and the people of the country, I mean the 
Â« philofophic part of them, are equally at a lofs.
If the fpots were the fliadow of 
â€œ a palling cloud ; a vapour denfe enough to intercept the rays of the fun, would 
** certainly, when fufpended in a clear fky, be vifible, and immediately account 
â€œ for the appearance.
But, perhaps, the effect may be derived from a caufe dia- 
â€œ metrically oppofite to the den/ily of vapour.
Let us fuppofe a partial rarenejs 
** of the vapours diflolved in the atmofphere juft above the fpot ; while every 
â€œ other part of the fky flieds light, by the reverberation of rays on the furface of 
â€œ the lake, that part alone flieds but little, and leaves a correfponding fpot on the 
â€œ water; which, compared with the fplendour of the furrounding parts, appears 
â€œdark.
The date of the Iky may very well be confidered as a weather-gage: 
â€œ becaufe partial rarefactions dedroy the equilibrium of the air.â€ 
Thefe {hades are here called kelds, probably from the Saxon or Britifli word 
held, fignifyinga fpring, or fountain; and the particular fpots which are longed 
in freezing over are thus denominated.
We have generally obferved the fhades 
in a morning, fometimes fucceeded by rain, and always by wind from a fouth- 
erly point: there is a flight current of air, a gentle fwelling of the furface, yet the 
â€¢water not ruffled, butâ€œ crifped over with a gentle breeze,â€ the held appears dark, 
while

while the other parts are more filvery ; at a diflance, though the fun be obfeured, 
the appearance continues invariably the fame.
It looks as if oil had been poured 
on the water ; and prifmatic colours are vifible on the forface of the held, which 
varies in diameter in various places, and at different times, from 60 to 200 yards : 
is fometimes nearly circular, at others angular.
A little oil poured upon the lake 
from a point of land, will extend and calm the furface to a much greater diflance 
than would at firft be imagined.
We fpeak as to the effect, and leave it to others 
to develope the caufe.
The water is fometimes violently agitated, when there is little or no wind by 
the fhore : this is called a bottom-wind ; it is frequent in lakes in mountainous 
countries.
We have fome w'here feen it remarked, that while the lake of Geneva 
is thus affeded, there is quite a fform on the lake of Canjiance , and vice verfa.
The 
effed here is not in any greater degree than may, perhaps, be accounted for by 
the windâ€™s eddying round the hills.
Something of this kind feems to have given 
Spencer an idea wâ€™hich he introduces in his Idle Lake : â€” 
The waves come rolling, and the billows roar 
Outrageoufly, as they engaged wâ€™ere.
But not one puff of wind there did appear.â€ 
Early on a calm funny morning, the bottom may be feen at the depth of about 
twelve yards, and the fifhes may be difeovered as they play in flioals.
Something like a glory, or faint halo, with a flight mixture of prifmatic colours, 
may be obferved round the head of a perfon, when the exhalation is great, on a 
hot funny day, particularly if leaning over the fide of rhe boat.
In fummer, the fhowers of rain followâ€™ the hills in a fingular manner ; fome- 
times falling upon the hills on each fide of the lake, though not at all upon it; 
at others chiefly upon the lake, and not upon the hills.
Loud thunder, from the 
various reverberations, produces an aflonifhing effed.
You fcarce know on which 
fide the thunder cloud is, nor wâ€™hen the clap has ceafed.
A circumflance refpeding this lake, though by no means peculiar to it, we can- 
not pafs over in filence.
lnftind leads the cattle conftantly to the water during 
the hotter hours of the day; where, being more free from flies, and inhaling the 
coolnefs of that element, fome Handing belly deep, others only to the middle of 
the leg, they folace themfelves from about ten in the morning till four in the 
afternoon, and then return to their feeding.
During this great proportion of the 
day, they drop much dung, in which infeds neflle, and fo fupply food for the fifh, 
which would, perhaps, be poorly fubfifled, but from this contigency.
Thus 
Nature, who is a great oeconomift, converts the recreation of one animal to the 
fupport of another !

Dr. Brown has recommended a view of Derwent lake by moon-lighr.

notes in 
NATURAL HISTORY.
Animals deferving notice in this part, are the following : â€” 
Clafs 'Mammalia.
Suckle their young.
Order Ferae.
Upper fore-teeth Ax, fomewhat fharp and conic ; canine teeth 
two in each jaw, longer than the reft.
Genus Canis.
Fore-teeth in each jaw fix, grinders fix or feven, canine teeth 
curved, lateral fore-teeth longer, and diftant from the reft, the intermediate ones 
lobbed : five toes before, four behind.
Cams Vulpes , Fox. Tail a brufb, not bent, and tipt with white, lips white, fore- 
feet black.
Berkenhout.
â€” Upon the head of the Fox a price is fet: he is purfued 
with great ardour by the fhepherds, who keep hounds for the protection of their 
flocks.
Moft men are fportfmen by conftitution, and there is fuch an inherent 
fpirit for hunting in human nature, as fcarce any inhibitions or difficulties can re- 
ftrain.
The peaceful and hardy inhabitants here frequently indulge in the pleafures 
of the chace.
With the affiftance of a pike-flick , or long pole , they make fuch leaps 
in the purfuit, as would appear impoffible to men unaccuftomed to fuch hardy 
amufement.
Genus Felis.
Fore-teeth equal, grinders fix in each jaw, tongue rough, claws 
retracftile.
Felis Cahusy Ferus, Wild Cat. Tail long, annulled, body marked with fpiral, 
and three longitudinal ftripes.
Berken.
â€” It is frequently met with, and when 
hard preffed is very fierce.
She has been called the Britijh Tyger.
â€” WildUats were 
formerly reckoned amongft the beafts of chace, as appears by the charter of King 
Richard 11.
to the Abbot of Peterborough, giving him leave to hunt the hare, 
fox, and wild cat.
The fur was ufed in lining of robes : but was not efteemed 
of the moft elegant kind ; for it was ordained â€” " That no abbefs or nun fhould 
ufe more coftly apparel, than fuch as is made of Iambsâ€™ or catsâ€™ {kins.â€ 
Genus Mujlela.
Fore-teeth in each jaw fix, thofe of the under jaw clofe, obtufe, 
with two interior ones : body long and ftender, legs {hort, five toes on each foot.

Mujlela Lutra , Otter.
Colour dark brown, with two white fpots on each fide 
the nofe, length three feet three inches, tail comprelTed and taper, eyes fmall, ears 
fhort, long whifkers, feet webbed.
Berkenhout.
The Otterâ€™s ufual haunts are fought for amongft the recks and loofe Bones by 
the fide of the lake : dogs are trained up to the purfuit.
The Otterâ€™s bolting , or 
ruffling out of his retreat into the lake, is watched by the hunter, who endeavours 
to ftrike him with his otter-grains, or bearded fpear.
This is feldom done at firft, 
as he darts out with great velocity.
He dives eighty or a hundred yards, whslft 
every eye is upon the watch, to fee where the water breaks, by his pufhingup his 
nofe to take breath ; as foon as obferved, the boat puts off, and the dogs want no 
encouragement to fwim after, or leap into the boat.
The fecond time he comes 
up for breath, rather fooner than on his firft diving, and thus is purfued, till fome 
one is fortunate enough to ftrike him.
Frequently when a dog feizes him, if he 
has been much harraffed, he will lay hold of the dog, and plunge to the bottom 
with him, and there hold him till he is drowned.
A chace of this kind will laft 
four or five hours.
â€” The fkin of this animal bears a high price.
About thirty years ago, two Otters, caught when very young, were fo far tamed 
by Mr. Wane, of Scarnefs, near Baflenthwaite, that they would come out of the 
water from their fiftiing when he whiftled for them.
The female died, and the 
male vifited all the places about Scarnefs which they had frequented together, 
uttering doleful moans for the lofs of his partner.
Mufiela Martes , Martin.
Colour dark brown, with two white fpots on each fide 
of the nofe, length two feet and a half, canine teeth large, fkin and excrement fmell 
like mufk, nofe {harp.
Berkenhout.
â€” It is called the Clean Mart , (in oppofition 
probably to Foulmart t or koumart, the Weafel) occafionally affords good fport to 
the hunters in the woods and about the rocks.
â€” Its fkin is in high eftimation.
Order Glares.
Fore-teeth two in each jaw, remote from the grinders; no canine 
teeth.
Genus Sciurus .
Upper fore-teeth like wedges, lower compreffed.
Sciurus Vulgaris , Squirrel.
Colour red-brown, breaft and belly white, ears tufted, 
tail a brufh.
Berkenhout.
â€” Is in great plenty in Dunmallet, and there called 
Conn.
Boys frequently nurfe this beautiful and aeftive animal under Cats.
â€œ There 
Â«< are three creatures, the Squirrel , the Vield-moufe , and the bird called the Nuthatch, 
Â« which live much on hazel nuts; and yet they open them each in a different way.
<Â« The firft, after rafping off the fmall end, fplits the fhell into two v irh his long 
â€œ fore-teeth, as a man does with his knife; the fecond nibbles a hole with his 
<( teeth, fo regular as if drilled with a wimble, and yet fo fmall, that one would

A pair of the Golden Eagles had an aerie in Martindale two fucceffive years ; the 
firff year the female was fhot, and the male, after an abfence of about three weeks, 
returned with another female.
The next year, 1789, the male was killed, after 
which the female difappeared.
One of this fpecies was fhot by a perfon with 
duck fhot, only one cf w hich went through his head ; hemeafured eight feet three

Smith, in his Hiftory of Kerry, relates, that a poor man 
of that country got a comfortable fubfiftence for his family, during a w hole fum- 
mer of famine, out of an eagleâ€™s neft, by robbing the eaglets of the food brought 
by the old ones ; whofe attendance he protracted, by clipping the W'ings, and re- 
tarding the flight of the young.
In order to extirpate thefe pernicious birds, there 
is a law in the Orkney Ifles, which entitles every perfon that kills an eagle, to a 
hen out of every houfe in the parifli where it was killed.
Eagles are remarkable 
for their longevity, and for their power of fuflaininga long abffinence from food.

dred and four years.
And one, through the neglect of fervants, endured hunger

England breeds more of this kind of birds than any other country in Europe.
In the 24th of Henry VIII.
they were grown fo numerous, and thought to be fo 
prejudicial to the farmer, that they were confidered as an evil worthy of parlia-

Choughs were included.
Every hamlet was to provide crow-nets for ten years; 
and all the inhabitants were obliged, at certain times, during that fpace, to affemble 
and confult on the proper means for extirpating them.
But though the Crow 
abounds thus in Britain, it is fo rare in Sweden, that Linnaeus fpeaks of it only as 
a bird that he once knew killed there.

They marched in regular order, in a column of three or four 
hundred yards in breadth; neither rocks nor water were any obftruCtion.
At

Concerning thefe birds, we have the

V. pref.
xxv.
â€” " The late Mr. Robinfon, ReCtor of Oufby, in Cumberland, fays, "that birds 
â€ are natural planters of all forts of wood and trees.
They diffeminate the kernels 
" upon the earth, which, like nurferies, bring them forth, till they grow to their 
" natural ftrength and perfection.â€ He fays â€” â€œ About 25 years ago, coming 
" from Rofe-Caftle early in the morning, 1 obferved a great number of crows 
â€œ very bufy at their work, upon a declining ground, of a moffy furface; I went 
â€œ out of my way purpofely to view their labour, and I found they were planting 
" a grove of oaks.
The manner of their planting was thus ; they firft made little 
â€œ holes in the earth with their bills, going about and about till the holes were deep 
â€œ enough, and then dropped in the acron, and covered it with earth and mofs.
" The feafon was at the latter end of autumn, when all feeds are full ripe.
Mr.
â€œ Robinfon feems to think that Providence had given the crows this inftinCt 
" folely for the propagating of trees; but I imagine it was given them principally

Their young ones, as 
< f foon as hatched, are naturally led by them into creeks and ponds ; and this 
â€¢* (he imagines) gave rife to the old vulgar error, that geefe fpring from barnacles.

At Cockermouth the Sahno Fario is difiinguifiied from the White Frout> or Salmon

Five or 
fix ounces is a common weight ; the largeft are commonly the belt for the table,

In the winter months, great quantities 
are potted, along with the Charre, and fent to London, &c.
The angler, on a 
favourable day, here enjoys his diverfion in higher perfection than in mod places.
A Trout occafionally ftrays out of the Eamont into the lake, and vice verfa, out of 
the lake into the river.
They are eafily diftinguifhed by their fpots; and it is 
obferved, that a filli taken from its ufual place is not in fo good a condition as 
one of equal length taken on its own ground ; hence it is probable, that they do 
not emigrate, except when difeafed or fpawning.

months are Charre.
They are moft plentiful in the upper part of the lake, which 
is the deepeft.
The only time when this filh is to be had in any confiderable 
quantity, is when they frequent the fhallow part of the lake, in order to depofit 
their fpawn, which they do in the fhallower water in the months of November and 
December.
They are then out of feafon, a few excepted, which have not fpawned, 
and which will not fpawn till the next feafon.
Thefe, by the fifhermen, are called 
geldfijb.
We have received the following account from F.
Mafcall, of Cockermouth, 
Efq.
(from whom we have received much information in natural hiftory) â€” f Â« The 
â€œ Red Charre is in .Ennerdale lake.
About the 7th or 8th of November, but 
â€œ feldom before, they leave the lake, and enter the river Lifla, where they flay 
â€œ about three weeks ; and are moft abundant after rain.
They are chiefly found 
â€œ about 300 yards above the lake, near a wooden bridge ; and fome go about 400 
" yards further up the river to depofit their fpawn.
Though rarely caught by 
â€œ angling in the lake, yet, when in the river, they may be taken, by a bait of 
Â« f Salmon roe, a piece of the orange-coloured belly, or an orange-coloured fin of 
â€œ the male Charre, a holly-berry, a piece of red cloth, or a piece of carrot.
When 
<f in great abundance, they may be driven up the river, by fplafhing in the ftream, 
,f between them and the lake : this treatment does not deter them from taking 
u the bait of an angler.
The variety here differs from the Charre of Cromack

â€œ entirely.
They are commonly about nine inches in length.â€

â€œ This fifh is an inhabitant of feveral of the lakes of the alpine parts of Europe.
It is found in thofe of Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy; of Norway, Sweden, Lapland, 
(where, Schaeffer fays, they are caught of the weight of idb.
or 12 lb.) and 
Scotland ; in thofe of Ireland, and of Cumberland, and in Wales, in that of 
Llyntegid, near Bala, in Merionethfhire.
** It is the fame with the Ferra of the lake of Geneva, the Schelley of Ullfwater, 
the Pollen of Lough Neagh, and the Vangis and Juvangis of Lochmaben.
The 
Scotch have a tradition, that it was firft introduced there by their queen, the 
unfortunate Mary Stuart : and, as in her time the Scotch court much affedted the 
French, itfcems likely that the name was derived from the French Vendoife > a Dace; 
to which a flight obferver might be tempted to compare it, from the whitenefs of 
its fcales.
The Britifh name Gwiniad , or Whiting, was bellowed on it for the fame 
reafon.
â€˜ c It is a gregarious fifh, and approaches the fliore in vaft flioals in fpringand in 
fummer, which prove, in fome places, a bleffed relief to the poor of inland 
countries, in the fame degree as the annual return of the Herring is to thofe who 
inhabit thecoaft.

was allured by an Ullfwater filherman, that laft fummer he took between 7 and 
8000 at one draught !
â€œ The Gwiniad is a fifh of an infipid tafte, and mud be eaten foon, for it will not 
keep long : thofe that choofe to preferve them do it with fait.
They die very 
foon after they are taken.
Their fpawning feafon in Llyntegid is in December.
" The largeft Gwiniad we ever heard of, weighed between 31b.
and 41b.: we 
have a Ferra we brought with us out of Switzerland, that is 15 inches long; but 
thefe are uncommon lizes : the filh which we deferibe was 1 1 inches long, its 
greateft depth 3 inches.
â€œ The head final], fmooth, and of a dulky hue; the eyes very large, the pupil 
of a deep blue; the nofe blunt at the end ; the jaws of equal length; the mouth 
fmall and toothlefs ; the branchiroftegous rays 9 ; the covers of the gills filvery, 
powdered with black.
â€œ The back is a little arched, and flightly carinated ; the colour, as far as the 
lateral line, glolfed with deep blue and purple, but, towards the lines, affumes a 
filvery caft, tinged with gold, beneath which thofe colours entirely prevail.
" The fide line is quite firait, and confifts of a feries of diftind fpots of a dufky 
hue ; the belly is a little prominent, and quite flat on the bottom.
The firft dorfal 
fin is placed almoft in the middle, and confifts of 14 branched rays: the fecond 
is thin, tranfparent, and not diftant from the tail.
The pecftoral fins had 1 8 rays, 
the firft the largeft ; the others gradually fhortening : the ventral fins were com- 
pofed of 12, and the anal of 1 5, all branched at their ends ; the ventral fins are in 
fome of a fine fky blue, in others as if powdered with blue Ipecks ; the ends of the 
lower fins are tinged with the fame colour.â€ So far Mr. Pennant.
Here they go in Ihoals in the fummer months, from June till November, which 
may be' oblerved at a confiderable diftance, by the rippling they make on the 
furface of the water.
As they traverfe the lake in all directions at the fame time, 
and do not fwim at any great diftance till they return to the main group, they 
feldom rife wholly out of the water, but will approach clofe to a boat, and are 
frequently overturned with the oars.
They all fwim near the furface, as is evi- 
dent from the depth which they are caught in the net.
Ten thoufand are lome- 
times drawn out at a fingle haul.* They retire into the deep water to fpawn in 
February, and then are but rarely taken.
In the autumnal months, a larger fpecies, 
weighing from feven to twenty ounces, is taken (but in fmaller quantities) along 
with the Trout, &c.
Thefe are of a much fuperior quality, and are denominated 
Harveji Schelley.
The country people lay a little fait upon them, and fmoke-dry 
the fmaller fort, which weigh from 4 to 8 ounces each, and they make excellent 
â– winter provifion.
We have obferved fome flight variations from the defeription 
of Mr. Pennant; one weighing 7^ ounces was 11 inches long, and 7^ round at 
the breaft; the pedoral fins confifted of 16 rays on the right fide, and of 17 on 
the left.
This we have oblerved to vary in fome, finding an equal number of rays 
* â€œ They weigh about 5 ounces each, and 800 are commonly reckoned as many as one horfc can 
â€œ draw ; they are at thefe times extremely cheap, generally a penny per pound, â€” but I have feen two

They do not rife at a fly, or take any bait prepa-

We are favoured with the following curious genealogical table of the Dacre 
family, which was taken by Lord William Howard, from armorial bearings, with 
infcripcions around them on painted glafs, in the hall at Kirkofwald caftle.
â€” 
Some parts of the glafs, with the infcriptions, were placed by Philip Howard, 
Efq. of Corby, in the windows of Wetheral church, where they remain, other 
parts are in Mr. Howardâ€™s poffefiion.
The paper from whence our copy was 
taken, is in Lord Williamâ€™s hand-writing.
â€” The words in Italic, are notes of his 
lordfhipâ€™s, as w'ell as the number which precede the names.
It is believed, that Thomas the VI.
or his fucceffor, was the perfon who had 
the glafs painted, and put up at Kirkofwald.

Randolf the II.
(who is the 9th Lord of Dacre, in the account taken from the 
glafs windows of Kirkofwald cattle) was pofiellbr of the cattle and the mefnc 
manors of Dacre and Soulby, and fome land in Newbiggin; two fealings in Aller- 
dale, Mofedale, Grecnrig, Caldbeck, and Dunwalloghr, in the county of Cum- 
berland ; of the manors of Keller, Hefham, Halton, Fifhwick and Euletton, in 
Lancathire; and the manor of Holbech in the county of Lincoln.
He married 
the heirefs of Thomas of Multon, towards the end of the reign of Henry III.
who 
brought him all the pofleflions of that family.
The patrimonial ettate of the 
Multons, was the cattle and manor of Multon, and the town and manor of Spald- 
ing, in the county of Lincoln; but Thomas of Multon, by marrying the heirefs 
of Hugh de Morville, (one of the knights who afiaflinated Thomas of Beeket) had 
added the barony of Burgh on Sands, the charge and property of hereditary foretter 
of the foreft of Inglewood, the manor of Lazonby, and the manor and cattle of 
Kirkofwald, which Hugh de Morville had built and obtained a market for, with 
the cattle and manor of Knarefborough in Yorkfhire.
Thomas, the fon of the 
Paid Thomas de Multon, then married Maud, the heirefs of Hubert de Vailibus, 
the laft Lord of Gilttand of that name, who brought to him the whole barony of 
Gilfland with its dependant manors, with the hamlets of Brakenhill, Eckefby, 
Melverton, and Northw'ood ; the manors of Aikton, Rowcliffc, and Glaffonby, 
in Cumberland; of Barton Addelathes, and the moiety of the town of Overton, 
or Orton in Weftmorland ; the manor of Hatton in Norfolk, and other pofleflions 
in Suffolk, Somerfetttiire and Dorfetfhire; and the manor of Nether Traylins in 
Scotland.
The whole of which pottettions, added to his own patrimony, became 
the property of the aforefaid Randolf de Dacre, by his marriage with Matilda de 
Multon.
Part of this property became the portion of a daughter, and founded the 
family of the Lord Dacres of the fouth; but this fhare was trifling, in comparifon 
with what remained to the male branch, and the lofs of it was moft amply com- 
penfaced, by the fubfequent marriage of Thomas the 6th, to Elizabeth, the heirefs 
of Ralph the latt Lord of Grayttock, who brought unto the Dacre family, the cattle 
and barony of Grayttock, with all its mefne manors, and dependancies in Cum- 
berland; the cattle and manor of Morpeth, wflth Hippifcotes, Traneweil, Stanyng- 
ton, Horfley, Benton, Killingworth, Angerton, Heddon on the Wall, StifFord, and 
Wigham, in the county of Northumberland; the manors of ConnifclifFe, Nefham, 
and Brereton, with other lands in the county of Durham : the manor of Wybolfion, 
in Bedfordfhire; the manors of Brun or Brunum, of Grimthorpe, Beilby, Seton, 
Litilethorpe,, Spaldington, Alram, Etton, Dringhowy Milington, and Wel'cury, 
Butterwick, with its appurtenances; Sherborne, Boythorpe, Fiixron, Falketon,

Thorpebattet, Shakelthorpe, le Holme, in Ofmundery, Morion upon Swale, 
Thrinetoft, Croflthwaite, Thornton upon the moor, and Nidde, in the county of 
York; the manors of Dutton, Aykefcough, Flafcough, Brampton Mill, Halettede, 
and Hindring in the county of Wettmorland; the manors of Thingden in North-

The church of Dacrcf was reefhor ial , and is dedicated to St. Andrew.
Some 
have fuppofed it was appropriated to the old monaftery, which religious houfe was, 
perhaps, deflroyed on fome incurfion of the Scots ; afterwards it was annexed to 
the college of Kirkofwald, as before noted.
It is a neat edifice, and if we credit 
tradition, was built out of the ruins of the monaftery, and in lieu of a mean ere&ion 
which flood at about the diftance of half a mile.
In Dacre church-yard are four remarkable monuments, being the figures of 
bears, about five feet in height, fitting on their haunches, and clafping a rude 
pillar, or ragged ftaff, on which two of the figures reft their heads ; the other two 
carry on their backs the figure of a lynx, one is in the attitude of attempting to 
rid himfelf of the animal on his fhoulders, with his head twilled, and paw caft 
behind him.
They are placed on a fquare, two to the eaft of the church, and 
two to the well.

Here 
ny thereto ; and, though laborious and exercifing travel, became inftrumental in the firft planting thereof, 
about the city of Norwich and parts adjacent.
Having been conduced through a long courfe of years, 
unfpotted to his concluiion, for the encouragement of all who may read this account, the following ex- 
tract from the tellimony of Devonfliire-houfe monthly meeting, concerning him (of which he was a very 
ferviceable member for above 50 years) is thought worthy a place in thefe memoirs; â€” 
He was born at Sunbigg, in the parifh of Orton, in the county of Weftmorland, about the year 1636, 
and was educated at the free fchool of Blencowe in Cumberland, where he made a confiderable profici- 
ency in the learned languages.
â€œ At, or about the 17th year of his age, when friends, by the migdity power of God, were gatheredâ€™ 
44 to be a people, the Lord was pleafed to vifit him ; and by the teftirnony of truth, he was reached unto, 
â€œ and convinced of the necelfity of an inward and fpiritual work, to be known and wrought upon the 
44 fouls of men ; and of the emptinefs of outward (hew and formality in religion.
In the year 1654, 
â€œ and the 1 8th year of his age, the Lord fent him forth to preach the everlafting gofpel in life and 
44 power ; and having paffed through York, Lincoln, and Cambridge, travelling on foot, he came into 
44 Norfolk and Suffolk, where he vifited fome few meetings of fiiends and fober profefiors ; at one of 
44 which, near the whole meeting was convinced, by the mighty power of God, through his lively and 
** piercing teftirnony and prayer.
â€œ He continued fome months in Norfolk, and about Norwich ; where, having meetings, he preached 
44 the everlafting gofpel, and thereby turned many from darknefs to light, and from the power of fin and 
44 Satan unto God and his power ; that people might not continue in empty forms and (hadows, but 
44 come to the life and fubftance of true religion, and know Chrift their true teacher and leader ; greac 
â€œ was his fervice, labour, and trial in thofe counties, whereby many were reached unto, convinced of, 
44 and eftablifhed in the bleffed truth ; and fome railed up to bear a public tellimony thereunto ; he 
â€œ differed great oppofition, hardfnips, long and fore imprisonments, and fevere whipping, for his tefti- 
44 mony to the truth, in thofe his tender years as by his journal of more than 600 pages, wherein 
many of his fervices and travels throughout mod parts of this nation are largely related, will appear.
â€œ He was one whom the Lord had fitly qualified and prepared, by his divine power and holy Spirit, 
44 for the wotk whereunto he was called ; and whereby he was made an able minifter of the gofpel ; he 
44 had large experience of the work of God, and deep myfieries of the heavenly kingdom, and was tre- 
41 quently opened in meetings to declare of, and unfold the fame, in the clear demonftration of the Spirit 
â€œ and power, dividing the word aright, to the opening and' convincing the underftandings of many who 
14 were unacquainted with the way and work of truth ; and to the comforting, confirming and efta- 
44 blifliing of the children of the Lord in their journey and travel Zion-wavd.
4 â€˜ He was not only a zealous contender for, and affertor of the true faith, and dodlrine of our Lord 
41 and Saviour Jefus Chrift, in a found and intelligible teftirnony, but alfo was valiant and fttllful in the 
44 defence thereof, 3 gainft adverfaries and oppofers of the fame ; and one, who, through a long courfe of 
44 many days, was careful to adorn the doftrine of our holy profefiion, by a circumfpeft life, and godly 
44 converfation, wherein the fruits of the Spirit, in love, joy, peace, long fuffering, gentlenefs, goodnefs, 
44 faith, meeknefs, and temperance, did eminently (liine forth through him, to the praife and glory of God.
44 Being thus qualified, he was had in good efteem amongft mod forts of people that were acquainted 
44 with him ; which tended much to the opening his way in his public fervice for truth, and frequent 
44 folicitations of the king and parliament, bilhops and great men in his time, for the relief and releafe 
44 of his fuffering friends and brethren, under fore peTfecutions and hard imprifonments, and for liberty 
44 of confcience, and alfo for relief.in cafe of oaths ; in which labour of love and eminent fervices, among

Here are the remains of an old tower, part of the manerial houfe (to which was

fettled here in the reign of King Edward III.
â€” Of this family, particular mention 
was made when we treated of Littie Blencowe, in the parifh of Grayftock.
Stainton is a pleafant neat village, remarkable for the longevity of its inhabi- 
tants : it is a member of the barony of Grayftock, the manor of a mixed tenure,

In this parifh, has an extenfive view from its-fummir, upon which was eredfed a 
fquare building by George Thompfon, a native of this parifh, and in whofe family 
this property has been for a long time.
This building he intends for a 
fummer-houfe.f 
44 way for him in the hearts of the rulers ; fo that his faithful labour was often crowned with fuccefs, to 
44 the comforting and rejoicing of the hearts of many fuffering brethren.
â€œ He was a good example to the flock, in his diligent attendance of fi rfh and week-day meetings for 
â€œ public worfhip, and other meetings for the fervice of truth, fo long as his ability of body remained : 
44 willing to take all opportunities for publiflfing and promoting the truth ; zealous to fupport good or- 
44 der and difeipline in the church of Chrift ?
and as he was not fuddenly for taking hold of any, fo he 
44 was as examplary in not being forward to call any off, in whom there appeared any thing that was 
44 good ; being always defirous to encourage the good in all, condefcending to the weak, but admonifh- 
44 ing the faulty in the fpirit of meeknefs and wifdom, that they might be preferved in love to truth, and > 
44 come into the unity of the one Spirit, which is the bond of peace.
54 He was a tender father in the church, fympathizmg with the afflidted, whether in body or mind ; 
44 a diligent vifitor of the Tick, and labouring to comfort the mourning foul ; careful to prevent, and di- 
u ligent in compofing differences.
â€œ It pleafed the Lord to vifit him with fome feverc pains and weaknefs of body, fo that he was dif-' 
44 abled for fome weeks from getting to meetings ; but he often expreffed his dtfires for the welfare of 
the church of Chrift, and that friends might live in love and unity.
44 He continued in a patient, refigned frame of mind to the will of God, waiting for his great change, 
44 rather defiring to be diffolved and be with Chrift, faying, â€œ the fting of death was taken away,â€ 
â€œ He expreffed a little before his departure, that he had a renewed fight or remembiance of his labours, 
44 and travels, that he had gone through from his fir ft convincemcnt ; he looked upon them with abun- 
* 4 dance of comfort and fatisfaction, and admired how the prefence of the Lord had attended and carried 
44 him through them all.
44 He departed this life in great peace and quiet, the 8tn of the firft month, 1722-3, about the 87th 
14 year of his age, having been a minifter about 68 years, and was buried the 1 3th of the fame, in Friends

It is very likely this

fo that if the ftory be true, that a boat or two loaden with ftones were funk at fea, a great many of

Mr. Horfley was of opinion that this Ration was the Bremetenracum of the 
Romans,^ its fituation is clofe to the grand Roman road, leading to the wall, and 
whofe remains, before it was interrupted and covered by the turnpike road, were 
very vifible.
It was that learned Antiquaryâ€™s determination, that Carlide was the 
lugctvallium ad vallum, but abandoned before the writing of the Notitia, except 
which, that there never had been any Ration on this way nearer to the Wall, than

The readiug of the third line is according to the conjecture in Camden, though I cannot fay it is fa- 
tisfa&ory; nor can I well tell how to mend it.
Mr. Ward thinks it may be read in the following 
manner: â€œ I donâ€™t doubt but the three firft lines after D M fhould be read, FI.

So 
** that this Martius had been a fenator and treafurer, or chamberlain, among thefe Carvetii , whoever

the office he bore, and all the two former lines contain his name or his country.

The remains of this Ration are very diftindt, the vallum in every part 
perfectly to be traced, as alfo the ditch on three lidcs; bcfides thefe, the out- 
buildings are obfervable, fcattered over the adjoining ground, on the banks of 
Petrill.
The ground within the Ration has been level, and contains about three 
acres, 
counfels and defigns; as we are told by Lampridius in his life of this emperor.
â€œ Alexander, the 
â€œ fon of Marnmea , was from his childhood trained up in good arts, both civil and military, and did 
<â€˜ every thing according to his motherâ€™s advice.â€ The words numini ejus donâ€™t feem at firft fight to 
fuit well with what the fame writer fays of him elfewhere, â€œ that he would not be called lord;â€ nor 
his being joined to the deae matres with his favouring Chrijlianity fo much, as he plainly infinuates.
I 
believe this is the only inlcription in Britian where this emperorâ€™s name occurs, And the profound 
lilence of ancient hiftory with refped to the tranfaftions here during his reign, makes it impoflible to 
afiign the particular occaiion of the infcription.
But the greatcft curiofity of it, lies in its being confe- 
crated to the deae matt es tramarlnee , or tranfmarina.
We have the matt es dome fie re upon an altar now 
at Scaleby cajlls , which feem to be diftinguifhed from thefe mattes tranfmarina, and the two char afters 
may ferve to explain each other.
And by this we may be helped to corredf the reading of another in- 
fcription, from which the learned Dr. Gale endeavours to draw an argument with refpedt to Bremenium .
DEABVS MATRIBVS 
TRAMAL.
VEX.
CERMA 
The doctor would have the fir ft word in the fecond line to be Bratnae for Bramenium ; but it is evi- 
dent from this other infcription, that it ought to be read tramar for tramarinis.
The deae matres , as 
the doftor obferves, were much worfhipped in Germany s and thefe matres tranfmarinae feem to be 
either the fame with them, or the matres Gallicae mentioned in an infcription found in Spain.
So that 
fuch inferiptions as thefe may probably have been erefted by fome of the Gallic or German auxiliaries.
That implication in the fecond line, wherein the I of Julia is joined to the ET, that goes before, is not 
common though we have fome others as remarkable.
There is a fingle E at the end of the word divi- 
nae.
For the AE at the end of the line, I take to be the firft letters in aeterna or aeternaeque , ano- 
ther grand compliment to the imperial family.
It is not certain by whom this infcription was eredled, 
though the remains of the imperfeft letters look like vexillatio militum Romanorum, which appeared 
more evident to me upon a fecond infpeftion.
And perhaps vexillatio militum Romanorum may be op- 
pofed to a vexillation of the auxiliaries, fuch as vexillatio Germanorttm , or Vardulorum.
Was it not for 
a part of the under oblique ftroke of the laft letter, I (hould take it for a P, and read without much 
fcruple vexillatio militum pofuit.
And perhaps the word fecit or pofiit followed in a line below.
The 
Jlratum below TOTI was gone, and under the line had begun further in, but how much is uncertain.
The Hone is not in the form o f an altar, but an honorary monument, though it be inferibed to the deae 
matres , as well as to the emperor; of which there are parallel inftances.
Thus in Montfauccn there is 
an infcription to the deae matres , as well as to the honour of the divine houfe, and yet the Hone upon 
which it is cut is not upon an altar.
Perhaps it has been on the wall of a temple erefted to the deae matres, 
and in this refpect like that at Chichejler.
The people told me, they knew by the nature of the ftone it 
came fiom Lazonby quarry.

becaufe that was in thefe parts; of which there is no other evidence concerning the fecond.
But colors

The infcrip-

I am much of opinion that this cohort afterwards might be the ettneus armaturarum,

Heron was the name of a Grecian orator, and fo perhaps it may have been of this prefeft.
We meet 
with it in Gru/er, hut with a point after it, as if the termination was wanting, io that every one may 
read it here as he pleafes.
The firft I in Domitius does not appear, but that may be included in the 
next letter on either fide, which is not uncommon.

FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGIA.
Mr. Gough on the De;e Matres, 9th Jan. 1772.
Among the unknown gods which feem to have been introduced at Rome, or worfhipped in her pro- 
vinces, and occur in inferiptions in the later periods of the empire, the De<e Matres have given no fmall 
trouble to antiquaries.
The firft who took notice of them, I believe was Span, who, in his Mifcellana Eruditce Antiquitatis, 
p. 105, takes them for â€œ deified women, who, while living, were thought to have the gift of prophecy ,â€ 
fuch as are mentioned by Cafar(a) and Tacitus, (b) and fuch feem to have been among the Britons at 
that time:(r) Keyfier, in a diflfertation on this fubjedf, is of the fame opinion.
(d) Profejfor Ward, in 
Horfleyâ€™s Brit.
Rom. p.
201, adds, â€œ afer their death they feem to have been worfi 'ripped as a fast of genii , 
or tutelar deities oj the places where they refided, itfe.â€ Mr. Horfiey obferves, that Co; far calls thefe women 
matres familias.
Now it appears to me, that our learned profefTor miftook the fenfe of Tacitus, who fays of thefe wo- 
men, that the Germans venerati funt eas nec adulatione nec tanquam facerunt deas ; which is juft the 
contrary of deification, and implies a veneration between human refpedf and divine worfhip ; fo that thefe 
prophetefles have not the leaft claim to the rank of Dene Matres ; nor will Keyfier 1 % interpretation of facere 
deas, as if it meant making deities, whofe divinity the very worfhippers doubted of, at all avail.
Menetrier in his Hijlorie du ville de Lyons, fo.
1 096, p.

Charier in his Reckerches fur les Antiquities de Vienne, p.
135, feems to have formed the beft con- 
jectures about thefe deities ; that, about the time of Pertinax and Severus, a notion prevailed among the 
Romans, that each province, emperor, and particular perfon, was undet the patronage of certain nymphs, 
to whom they gave the name of matres ; or, as they, by a barbarous pronunciation, called it matree ; 
but thefe deities having been introduced from the villages, retained the names given them by the country- 
people ; whence we find in infciiptions, Matribus Ga/licis,(g ) dis Matribus , Matribus Augujliis, itfe.
Thofe fuppofed to protect the emperor and his houfe, were called Matres AuguJhje, mere des Augujles.

Dr. Gale, in his Commentary on Antoninusâ€™s Itinerary , p.

Here from Germany.
That they were deities of barbarous nations, is plain, both from the additional names given them, and 
from the people who dedicated the altars to them.
Thus two altars in Horlley, Scol.

it is to thefe people we are probably indebted for the introduftion of thefe deities among us ; the inferip- 
tions to their honour in Germany, being found along the banks of the Rhine , which was the northern 
boundary of their territories.
A cohort of them came over before the time of M.
Aurelius , and conti- 
nued here until the lateft period of the empire.
Of the feven inferiptions in Menetrier , three or four are dedicated by foreigners, the others by Romans^ 
All thefe want the epithet Dea. Three in Horlley have it.
Five in Menetrier have Augujliis , the 
other two matronis aufaniis, and auf ambus, (which two epithets are undoubtedly the fame) and ma- 
tribus Pannoniorum and Dalmatorum, perhaps matt is in four of thefe is an abbrevation of matronis , the 
llroke above being overlooked, and then we avoid the imputation of barbarifm.
The campejires are joined with the alatervx in Horlley.
In Spoil, de diis ignotis, they accompany the 
Salavae .
In this laft-mentioned author, we have an infeription, tnatris Geraditiabus found near Geronne 
in Spain; alfo others Vediantii Mopatibus and Galiabus.
The firft of thefe, found at Nice in Provence* 
belongs to the Vediantii, an alpine nation; the fecond of Mineguen palles the Ikill even of Keyjler to 
explain.
The laft is on a (lone found near Cologne , and is alfo given to Juno.
Menetrier derives Ah- 
fania from the German Ojfen, q.
d. Court, as if they were deities of the emperorâ€™s houfehold: Keyfier, much 
more probably, from the two northern words, fan, god, and air, a valley.
The Gallaicet belong to Spain ,

Rumanticim, in the duchy of Juliers.
Thefe, and many other inftances that might be adduced, at the fame time that they prove thefe matres 
to be local deities, prote&oreffes of certain towns or villages, demonftrate them to have been obje&s of 
devotion to the Gauls and Germans, from whom they palled into Britain : where, on two inferiptions, 
they are exprefsly ftiled Tranfmara.
Keyfer, from the authority of Mairabus, in two inferiptions, which 
certainly is a miftake for matrabus, if not for matribus, gives them a Celtic, or Scandinavian, etymology, and 
thence immediately concludes in favour of the prophetelfcs.
It is fomewhat remarkable, that, of the thirty 
inferiptions ere&ed to the honour of thefe deities in different parts of Europe, Britain has the next greatell 
Bumbcr to France, where there are fourteen ;â€¢ we have nine, and Germany has fix.
The matrons are 
plainly diftinguilhed from the matres on the infeription at Lyons,.
ere&ed to both by Pompeianus.
The Abhe Banier, who inclines a little to the notion of their being deified women, finds the origin of 
thefe goddeffes.

Trojan war to Engnia, a city in Sicily, built by his countryman, under Minos.
According to Diodorus

for their good office, were tranflated into the liars that form the great bear .

each hand by turrets ;Â§ the figure of the foundations and ruins being circular, the 
other entrances retain no diftin<5t figure.
From this obfervation, we fubmit it to 
the learned in antiquities, whether any towers of Roman work, of which there are 
yet diftinft remains in Britain, were circular; and we would draw this inference, 
that the form and remains of fuch turrets, and the name of Caftle-Steads imply, 
IVeJfellengius indeed is for diftinguilhing the Cretan and Sicilian matres from thofe of the continent ; 
and I mull confefs myfelf fo far of this opinion, as to believe, at lead, that the matres were not worlhip- 
ped on the continent by the Romans till about the time afligntd by Cborier.
The Abbe Banier fuppofes â€œ thefe to be rural deities, from the offerings made to them conffing of fruits 
sind flowers ; and, on the infeription to the Suleize, a hog appears going to be facrificed, which was the vittim 
of Bacchus and Ceres.â€ The fame offerings will fuit them, confidered under the notion of Genii : fruits, 
flowers, milk, and fuch Ample things, being offered to the Genius of Rome, who was like thefe goddeffes, 
the Cornucopia and Patera, for libations.
The Abbe adds, â€” â€œ 7 hat the Gauls , who had a particular veneration for thefe goddeffes, erected to them 
little chapels, called Cancelli, as appears by the ancient capitularies .â€ Such, perhaps, was the temple fup- 
pefed to belong to their images in Northumberland, and the three in Menetrier, and that in Kcyfler , 
which are the niches in which the three figures were feated.
Such may have been the vault re-opened 
at Elenborough, 1769, of which an account was then read to this fociety, and in which were actually 
found three figures like the Deae Matres before exijling in England.
What this learned author means by the Deae Matres exifting in England, we do not comprehend; but 
it appears to us, that this deification took place in the lower empire, after the manners of the people were 
contaminated with evil modes, and the grofieft adulation was grown into acceptation : the inftances of 
impious flattery paid to the moft wicked wretches who affumed the imperial purple, are too numerous 
to require a quotation ; then it was that altars were confecrated to the Deae Matres ; it was not enough 
to addrefs living perfonages with thefe adulative dedications, but the genius of the emperor, and the 
emperorâ€™s anceffors, were to be honoured with votive altars.
It occurs to us, that all the epithets, 
auguj}, & c.
fuit well with this idea: and particularly with Cafarâ€™s appellation of matres familiar .
Nothing 
could be conceived a greater compliment to the mother of Alexander, than the dedication before us ; it 
was an aflurance, that, after her deceafe, fhe fhould be claffed with the divinities, as that infeription fhewed, 
the matres would be adored by thofe who made their prayers for them then reigning.
The emperorâ€™* 
mother , the parent of the reigning family, feems to be the perfonage chiefly addreffed in thefe dedications; 
and hy inferibing them in the plural number, all the matres of the imperial family were invoked.

$ *â€¢ The generality of the old Rations in Britain, feem to have been originally conftrufted without 
11 turrets at the angles, or even in the intermediate fpaces of the walls.
Thefe flankers are, however* 
44 met with now and then, chiefly in places fituated towards the fouth part of the ifland, which the Rp- 
44 mans were longefl in poffeflion of.
Hence it is natural to fuppofe, that the greater part of them were 
â€œ added by way of improvements to their fortifications, in the fubfequent reparations they underwent.
44 The author remembers not to have feen more than two ftations of the fquare or oblong fort with tower* 
44 at the angles, though polfibly there may be others which have efcaped his notice.
The firft inftance 
4< is at Lincoln ( Lindtim Colonise ) were in that part called Newport, which is evidently a proceffrium t 
44 or addition to the original ftation, there are two towers at the angles towards the north ; the military- 
â€œ way leading to the Humber, and likewife fending a branch over the Trent, iffuing from between them.
â€œ The fecond is Borough Caftle, near Yarmouth, the Gariononum of the Notitia, where the Stablefian 
44 horfe were quartered, under the count of the Saxon Ihore ; and which confequently mult have been 
44 one of the laft places they occupied in Britain.
This ftation is fortified with turrets at the angles, a* 
â€œ well as on each fide of the gate.
Cafor, near Norwich, which certainly is the Vent a Icenorum , hath 
44 towers at a little diftance from the gate, on that fide which lies next the river, but none at the angles.
44 The fame is the cafe at Caerwent Monmouthlhire, the Venta Silurum.
One fide of Colchefter, Ca-

â– that, after the Ration had been evacuated by the Romans, it was fortified and 
maintained by their fuccefiors, with works of a figure different from thofe ufed 
by the Romans, and peculiar to their fuccefiors.
There were fome infiances in 
the difcoveries at Caftle-Steads before treated of, which induce a belief that a tower 
had been eredted there after the departure of the Romans.
But, to leave this ob- 
fervation, the Pratorium alfo appears, but of a confufed figure, it having been 
much fearched and dug in for Rones : it lies near to the north rampart.
The

horfe ; and from the fhape of the G, and other circumffances of the infcription, 
â€œ it may probably be gathered, that this was in the low empire, and that the 
Ration was lately poffefied by the Romans, and fo the more likely to be a Notitia 
Â«* Ration.
Should it be fuppofed that the equefirian cohort was both a part of 
u the Ala Pelriana , and at the fame time itfelf the Cuneus Armaturarum, there 
* s might, perhaps, be nothing inconliflent in the fuppolition.
Camden fuppofed 
** Brampton , in Cumberland, to be the Bremetenracum , from the affinity of names ; 
<f and it muff be owned, that the fituation of Brampton, in one refpe<R, would do 
â– ** very well, that is, with relation to that part of the wall, which w'c muff fuppofe 
â€œ was to be relieved upon any emergency by the garrifon here : but in other 
Â« refpe&s it does not anfwer fo well, it is too near the wall, and too much out 
Â«.* of the line of the other Rations : befides, there is no good evidence that ever 
u there has been a Ration at Brampton: it is true, that the ruins of a Ration might 
â€œ foon be buried in fo large a town ; and there are, indeed, befides Brampton mote, 
'** fome trenches not far from the town; but 1 cannot fay they appeared to me like 
â€œ a Roman camp of any kind.
I muff add further, that there is a military-way, 
though now much ruined, which goes out from Old Perith towards Kefwick , but 
** not quite fo far weff.
This, I take for granted, has joined the other way that 
â€œ pafies from Elenborough , by Papcaftle , to Amblefule ; and that a branch has gone 
â€œ off from the latter to More] by.â€ 
It is very remarkable, that neither the editors of Camden, or Mr. Horfiey, have 
noticed the fine fepulchral infcription given in the Latin edition before us, fet up 
by Limiftus for his wife and daughter.

Extratf of a Letter from Mr. Richard Goodman, dated July 22 d, 1728.
Sir, 
The infcription inclofed was found in a very fine and large Roman fort upon 
the ftrect between this and Penrith, called by the country people Old Perith.
The 
flag is about two inches thick, the other dimenfions you have on the edges : there 
are two cracks on the ftone which divide it, and, at the letter R, the furface is 
broke, fo that the letters between I and D are loft : at the other crack, between 
O A, I believe there was a perpendicular ftroke, which made the letter an N, but, 
falling into the crack, it is out; and I wont fend you more than I find, not doubt- 
ing but you will foon difeover what is wanting: half the letters are wanting: 
what remains you have exadtly.
It now remains at Great Salkeld .* 
No. 6.
The other fmall altar was found at the fame place, and is now in the wall 
of a houfe : there is alfo another in a houfe hard by, which was formerly publifhed 
by Dr. Nic'nolfon, our late biftiop.

â€œ which I always took to be the Voreda of Antoninus , and not the modern town

It is the more to be valued, becaufe it explains another inferip- 
â€œ tion, in fome meafure, that the great Selden, in his book De Oils Syris, defpairs 
M of interpreting.
It is reprinted in my edition of Antoninus , with a very wrong

Extrafi of a Letter from the Rev. Mr.

â€œ I received yours, for which, and your friendlhip, I fhall full have a due re- 
gard.
I have lent you the infcription at Old Perith , which is exacftly thus :

Titus Donutius Heron Domo Nicomedienfis prafefius.
â€” I need 
not comment upon it, only Gallorum Equitum are too clofely

the letters are fair, htrt the Oâ€™s are fmaifer than the other 
letters.
Since I was there before, the farmer at the place 
where the Romans had had a large camp, dug up the pe- 
deftal of a large altar, the bafe being 4 feet 7 inches fquare.
with a fair moulding, which he has fplit into three pieces, to fet up betwixt the 
cows; on one fide of the fquare is a cornucopia ; but if there was any infcription 
f It was placed in the garden by Dr. Fleming, but is now entirely loft.â€” â€”T he Editors.

on the other (ides, is entirely defaced, by the ftoneâ€™s being broken in pieces.
There is on the end of the houfe another altar, but fmaller than I have ever feen, 
being but a foot broad, and 16 inches high, with fome obfcure letters upon it, 
which I do not underftand.
â€œ About three or four years ago, as Dr. Fleming, Dean of Carlifie, was parting 
by, the people were digging here, and found a ftone with an infcriprion, which he 
bought of them, and carried away with him.
â€œ I meafured the Roman caufeway, which goes clofe by Old Perith, at five feÂ« 
veral places, and find it anfwer 2 1 feet.
The old caftle, as the country people call 
it, is 130 yards in front, a vifible entry exaCtly in the middle, with a large forte on 
all fides.
This is all I can obferve, or acquaint you with at preftnt; only, as I 
returned home, I ftudied to trace the Roman way through the heath, and found 
that it runs through Perith fields to Broughton, where there has been a ftation ; 
and at two places, hard by the caufeway, I obferved two tumuli, one of 
them with two circles of ftones, and the other upon a raifed fquare piece of ground.
We have feveral tumuli, which I did believe to be Danifh, for I have feen in 
Denmark fome of the fame fafhion with thefe, and the like number of ftones, viz.
24 fet in two circles ; and what confirms my opinion, is, that, very near my houfe, 
there is a large one, by the neighbours called Harnefby Hill, but, in the writings 
which the gentleman has to whom it belongs, it is written Haroldâ€™s Hill ; fo I 
prefume fome Dane or Saxon has been buried there.
" As for Dr. Toddâ€™s Hiftory of Cumberland, I have this account of it from one 
that perufed it ; that there are feveral good remarks and obfervations in it upon 
the Roman remains in Cumberland and Weftmorland ; but he has intermixed the 
affairs of the country, families, and antiquities of churches, with the Scotch incur- 
fions, with a defign to engage the gentry and clergy here to come into fubfcrip- 
tions.â€â€” â€” Penrith, Jan. 30 tb, 1730-1.

Another Letter from Mr. Horsley.
Â«Â« I have received from a friend near Old Perith, another copy of the infeription 
lately difeovered there, but the letters are much the fame as before : 
There are feveral things which feem to be curious in the 
infeription, which I need not fuggeft to you.
The only 
difficulty in this reading is the third letter in the fecond 
line.
Both copies make it C, but fomewhat obfeure.
â€” I 
take it rather to have been a G, the genius of a perfon or 
place, I find is frequently conjoined with Jupiter optimus 
maximus in ancient inferiptions.
The cohort which eredted 
the altar, was probably the fecond equeftrian cohort of the Gauls; for it is men- 
tioned in another infeription found at this place.
â€œ After I had wrote this, I received yours, for which I thank you ; it was a 
great fatisfaeftion to me, to find you agreeing with my conjectures about the read- 
ing of the fecond line.
I fhould willingly have read it Geniis in the plural, but the 
Angle G feems to be decifive againft it.
Â«Â« As for the other infeription at Old Perith, both the copy I firft got of it, and 
my own, on feeing the original, make the laft letter in line penultima a D ; though 
I fee my engraver has made it too good and too diftineft on the plate.
I humbly 
think your reading, De Neeomedia, is fufficiently juftified by two parallel inftances 
at Old Carlifle, de murfa et de tufdra / both the inferiptions are in Camden.â€™'

I was told of a ftone, lately found at Plumpton, with 
an infeription ; thither I went, and heard that a prefbyterian minifter, employed by 
Mr. Horfley, had been there to view it; but I found he had not taken care to cleam 
it, fo as to make any judgment of the letters.
I wafhed and cleaned it with a

It is fubmitted that this infcription 
fhews us, that Belatucader, a name, perhaps, given to Apollo, was addrdfed as a 
diftind divinity from Mars, and was not a name applicable to any attribute of that 
deity; the conjundive following the word Belatucadro, induces us to apprehend 
that the dedication of this altar was to three diftind objeds of worihip.
We (hall 
not prefs the argument further on the judicious reader, to whom fo perfed a copy 
is prelented.* 
Plumpton 
* This altar was publiflied in the ninth volume of the Archsologia, communicated by Hayman 
Rooke, Efq. with the following obfervations: â€œ The altar, a PI.
17, was found about five years ago, in 
â€œ the Roman fort called Cajlle Steads , at Old Perith.
In Antoninusâ€™s Itinerary, it is called V ore da, and 
â€œ Mr. Horfley takes it to be Bremetenracum .
As this gentleman has given a plan of the fort, I fhall 
tf only mention the inclofed fpot where it was found.
It appears to have been an oblong fquare, 20 yards 
,s by 9 : the foundation of the wall is now vifible on the eaft fide of the fort, near the vallum, on which 
there are two tumuli ; thefe are not in Mr. Horfleyâ€™s plan.
The altar was dtfcovered by fome labour- 
t( ers.
in digging for ftoncs, about one foot under ground.
The infcription appeats legible, though the 
five or fix letters at the beginning of the fixth line, feem to be doubtful ; Auttorius may be defigned 
â€œ for the name or names of the prarfedt who eredled the altar.
The following letters I fhould think 
â€œ may be read, Libcntiffimc vovit pius praf edits ; but the Society will be the beft judges of this.â€

H. on the fubjeft, from 
his learned correfpondent.

TUNSTALL, Esq^ late of Wycliff, in the County of Tork, to W.

Dear Sir, 
I have confidered, with no fmall attention, the drawing of the curious altar dedicated to Bela- 
tucader, which you was fo kind as to fend me ; the arguments by B.
Lyttleton, and many others, againfl 
the opinion, that Belatucader was an appellation or cognomen of Mars, but rather of Apollo, or fome 
local divinity, are certainly ingenious and plaufible ; particularly, becaufe, before this, there was only one 
found in which the name of Mars occurs with Belatucader ; yet own, notwithftanaing fo many refpe< 9 > 
able authorities, and although you feem to be of that opinion, to which I pay no fmall deference, I 
cannot, as yet, remove my difficulties in that regard, nor think this new altar can determine the matter : 
perhaps you may not have perufed Mr. Peggeâ€™s difcourfe on Belatucader in the 3d vol.
of the Archaeologia, 
where, I think, his arguments are very ftrong in favour of its being an appellation of Mars ; in the new 
altar, by the drawing, the Deo Marti , being on what they call the capital of the altar, feems rather 
detached from the word Belatucader ; but, as there is no particular flop, or an et, intervening, it may ftill 
be judged a cognomen of Mars ; had there been an et between the two words, as fome fufpedted, though: 
without much foundation, had it once been in the former infcription, or the name of any other deity be- 
tween, the decifion would have been evident ; or even, had there not been an et before Numnibus Au - 
gujhis, it would have appeared more favourable to Biffiop Lyttletonâ€™s opinion; but to me, as it now Hands, 
it feems rather a confirmation of its being a cognomen of Mars than otherwife, as that appellation is 
once more joined to it without an et, which feems to take away the probability of that conjuudlion 
having once been in the former.
â€” The quotation from Richard of Cirencefter, in Mr. Peggeâ€™s difcourfe* 
who fays, that Mars had the appellation of Vitricadris, has no little weight with me.
I am fure you 
are too liberal to be any way offended at my differing in opinion from you in thefe matters.
The pre- 
fumption is greatly againfl; me, and, I dare fay, will prove fo, but I only fay how it ftrikesme ; the word 
Belatucader, according to Gale and Baxter, may be as applicable to Mars, from Britifli elyrriology, as 
to Apollo from the Greek or BeAo;, or the Hebrew Baal.
â€” I fend the 3d volume of the : Arcliseolo-

W. 
Dear Sir, 
I am but juft returned from Newcaftle, and till to-day, have had no time to examine Mr. H.â€™sin- 
feription, and now that I have time, can make nothing of it : in the hafty fcrawl I wrote by your fervant, 
I juft took notice, that I thought the characters like ACIOR, could be nothing from ACIES ; for, 
that I thought ACIES a bad word: that is no ftationary term, and never ufed by good writers, to de- 
feribe any particular part of the army when in garrifon, but either an army in general, or the front 
thereof in battle array.
For thoâ€™ unclaffical words are now and then found in fome Roman inferiptions, 
yet great care was taken to have the inferiptions correCl, on altars ere&ed by public authority, or by 
xnen in high ftations in the military fervice.
I do not remember any fuch, that a four critic can find 
fault with, till the time of Gordian.
It was from particular parts of the army, that the officers had 
their rank and title, as it is with us to this day.
Is it not poffible the latter part of AVGVSTALIS 
may be ALxE and ACIE ASTOR, that is Ale AJiorum ?
fuch a body cf men were ftationed on the

ftaff-officer and give him imperial command, and read AVGVSTALIS ACIERW or ACIE, in which 
cafe ACIES would be the bed word that could be chofen : but this is all guefs work.
If Mr. H.
will 
Inform me, by a line, where this altar is, and in whofe poffeffion, I will write to a clergyman not far from 
Penrith who, 1 think, is able to give the true reading.
I think Mr. H.
in his letter to you, mentioned an infeription in Reedfdale, to the god Mogon.
I 
thought his godjhip had been peculiar to the Brigantes ; but if he was worfhipped in Reedfdale, the 
Ottaduni had him too.
There was formerly at Nethevby, an infeription, which Smith, or Pocock, 01 
fomebody lead Deo Mogonti vita rejlaurat .
When I was there, juft before Mr. Graham began to build 
I could not find it, but was told that fuch an infeription was on the plinth of a fmall pillar, on which 
was placed a dcvilifhugly Gothic head.
The head I faw, but nothing elfe ; the workmanffiip of which 
was fuch as convinced me, the ftatuary was a moft religious obferver of the fecond commandment.

As we defeended to Armathwaite Caftle, fituated on the river Eden, we viewed 
TARN WADALYNE,

It covers about one hundred acres of land, and breeds fome of the

This lake is in a remarkable firuation, bordering 
upon a declivity which defeends towards the river for near a mile, and lies about 
fix hundred perpendicular feet above the level of Eden, capable of being drained

It is noted in antiquity for its 
vicinity to fome ancient fortrefs, and is celebrated by the following old hiftorical 
ballad in Percyâ€™s collection: 
u King Arthure lives in merry Carleile, 
â€œ And femely is to fee; 
â€œ And there with him Queen Gucnever, 
â€œ That bride foe bright of blee.
****** 
** The king a royale Chriftmafle kept,

Â«Â« And when they were to dinner fere, 
" And cups went freely round, 
â€œ Before them came a fair damfelle, 
â€œ And knelt upon the ground.
â€œ A boone, a boone, O King Arthure,

" Avenge me of a carlifh knighte,

â€œ And when I told him, King Arthure 
â€œ As lyttle ihould him fpare;

The date of this ballad is fuppofed to be before the days of Chaucer.
â€” In thefe 
early ages, hiftorical fads were couched in fuch allegories as this poem prefents; 
inchanted caftles, virgins mourning under fpells and forcery, and other ftrange 
images and conceits, fuited to the ignorance of dark times.
All that we can 
gather from the poem is, that here ftood the fortrefs of a powerful baron, whofe 
arms were, for fometime, irrefiftible; and who, by alliance in marriage, at length 
became the aflociate and triend of the reigning monarch.
Flow far this con- 
ftrudion may be fupported by hiftorical fails, or probable circumftances, we 
fubmit to the reader.
On the crown of a lofty eminence, towards the north-eaft of the lake, anti 
adjoining Aketgate, are the remains of a very ftrong building, which has 
contifted of feveral apartments, ftrengthened without-works and long extended 
trenches.
The dimenfions of the building are 233 feet by 147; befides a fmaller one at 
one corner 49 feet fquare.
The foundations (till appear, faced with large ftones' 
of athler-work, in fome ^places eight feet in thicknefs.
At what time this for- 
trefs was creded, or to whom it belonged, we find few traces in ancient authors.
Jt is called, by the neighbouring inhabitants, Gajlle Hezvin; and the neighbouring 
tenants pay to the lord of the manor a yearly rent, which is called Cajlle Hezvin 
rent.
Tradition reports it to have been one of the fortreftes and ftrongholds of 
King Ewaine.

Penrith, faid to belong to Ewaine Caefarius ; and we read, that Ewaine, King of 
Cumberland, joined with the Scots and Welfh againft Athelftan, before the time 
of the congrefs at Maybrough or Dacre.

ARMATH WAITE CASTLE 
Is feated in a very deep vale, and built on a rock, wafhed by the river Eden.
The houfe has a modern, elegant front of hewn (lone, with a new wing, confiding 
of offices.
It faces to the weft and fouth, the front windows have but a narrow 
profped, as they look upon the adjacent eminences, which are beautifully clothed 
with wood; but this is amply compenfated by the fouthern view, which, though 
not extenfive, is at once romantic and elegant.
From the fituation of the houfe 
on the brink of the river, you have a view up the ftreams for more than half a 
mile, in one direct line; forming a fpacious living canal, margined with rocks, 
and flanked on each fide by wooded banks.
To the eaft, is the beautiful terrace, 
belonging to the family of Richardfons, before defcribcd, with its hanging woods.
To the weft, favannnhs and rich meadows, clofely {hut in by lofty hills, gently 
inclining to rhe vale, and clothed with a variety of ftately foreft trees.
The 
canal is terminated by a cafcade at the falmon lock, before defcribed, falling in a 
fhcet of broken water from the dam.
In the wood to the weft of the houfe, is an 
agreeble winding walk, leading to the cafcade; in a recefs at the further end, a 
feat is placed in a well chofen fpot, where, in the feafon, you view the ineffedhial

ARMATHWAITE CASTLE, 
[Leatb Wari>..
The antiquity of the caftle of Armathwaite has not been ascertained.
The 
eonfufion before noted, when we defcribed Nunnery, is not to be reduced by any 
thing that appears, in the peculiar hiftory of this place.
The name itfelf has been 
deduced to us, from the compound of Ermet-mons-thwaite; and in old deeds I 
have feen it written Ermonthwaite ; from whence it has been conjectured, that in 
fome very difrant period, there was fome hermitage here; but no traces of any 
fuch place are now to be found.
We are rather led to conjecture, that the name 
(which is not unfrequent in the north) is formed of the Britilh ylr, a field; and.
the Saxon thwaitc , an high ground, qn which wood formerly grew.
The firll family we find refident here, was that of the Skeltons, but we have 
met with no record that fhews they were pofTeffed of Armathwaite before the 
35th King Henry VIII.
when, by an inquifition then taken, it is recorded, that 
John Skelton held the capital mefiuage of Armathwaite, in the foreft of Ingle- 
wood, by purpreflure of the king in capite.
paying 36s.
free rent, by the hands 
of the Sheriff of Cumberland.

Nunclofe is an appendage + to Armathwaite edate, but is faid to be a feparatc 
manor.
It lies within the parifh of Helket, and was granted by King William 
Rufus, in the fecond year of his reign, to the priorels and nuns of Emithwaite, 
in the following form : â€œ Ducentas et fexdecim acras terra?, cxidentes infra 
â€œ Re&or of Difs in Norfolk ; where, and in the diocefe, he was efteemed more fit for the flage than the 
â€œ pew or pulpit.
â€œ For his buffooneries in the pulpit, and his fatirical ballads againft the Mendicants, we are told, that 
â€œ he fell under the fevere cenfures of his diocefan and Wood, with all his ufual bluntnefs, adds, â€œHe 
â€œ was alfo punifhed by the Bifhop, for having been guilty of certain crimes , as mojl poets are." At length 
daring to vent his ridicule on Cardinal Wolfey, he was clofely purfued by the officers of that powerful 
miniftcr; and taking fhelter in the fanftuary of Weftminfter Abbey, was kindly entertained, and pro- 
tedled by Abbot Iflip, to the day of his death.
He died, and was buried in the chancel of the neigh- 
bouring church of St. Margaret, in 1529, and this infcription put over his grave, â€” â€œ Johannes Skeltonus,

To find a Church-yard in a church porch.
The late Mr. Warton, in his â€œ Hiftory of Englifh poetry,â€ with but too much reafon, taxes our poet 
with being â€œ coarfe, obfeene, and fcurrilous.â€ Puttenham, the author Gf â€œ the Art of Englifh poefie,â€ 
published in 1589.
and therefore, almoft a cotemporary, calls him, â€œ a rude ralying timer.â€ His cha- 
ra&eriflical vein of humour is, indeed, too often grotefque.
If his whimfical extravagancies fometimes 
move our laughter, they at the fame time fhock our fenfibility ; and on the whole, his genius feems to 
have been better adapted to low butlefque, than to liberal and manly fatire.

" defirc it as a particular favour; for the people in thofe days were ambitious, 
â€œ and fometimes gave large donations to be interred amongft thofe holy brethren.
** Dr, Todd relates a tradition, that the brft eredion of a chapel here, was about 
" the 
We beg leave to prefent to our readers, in this place, the following oLfervations upon agriculture, 
which were delivered to the tenants upon the eftates of Edward Conftable, Efq. in Holdernel's, Yorkfhire, 
by a very experienced gentleman, employed to view the fame ; and which rules have been adopted there, 
and are now received and adopted by the tenants upon his extenlive eftates in Richmondfhire : 
â€œ The general cuftom of the Holdernefs farmers, is to have one-third of their land in tillage, and to 
take two, three, and fometimes even four crops of corn, before a fummer tilt or fallow is given, whereby 
the lands become foul and impoverifhed ; and, if laid down to grafs in that ftate, will not become good 
fward for many years, which is the reafon why they are permitted to have only one-third in tillage.
â€œ As agriculture is a fcience that has of late years undergone confiderable improvements, it will not be 
amifs to point out the fyfttm of hufbandry that has, from repeated experience, been found to be the beft, 
and which is every day coming more and more into ufe among good farmers.
â€œ For example, â€” Suppofe a farm of 150 acres ; the method of cropping it according to the improved 
ftheme, is as follows ; 
[N.
B. The fame proportion will hold good in farms of any other fize.] 
â€œ Tifty acres, in old meadow or pafture, the latter to confift of the ftrongeft land, or where the clay 
lays neareft the furface, that kind of foil being leaft adapted for tillage.
â€œ Twenty-five acres in wheat, fown after clover, fummer vetches, rape, potatoes, peas or beans.
â€œ Twenty- five acres turnips or winter vetches, town after wheat ; if turnips, to be well manured and 
twice hoed; if vetches, to be mown or eat off green.
This is the fallow crop, for which the land fhould 
be well manured.
A compoft of lime and frefh earth from the banks, or rotten muck and earth mixed, 
and lain 12 or 18 months, and turned over in the time, is peferablc to either lime or muck alone.
â€œ Twenty-five acres barley or oats, fown after turnips or winter vetches.
Thefe to be fown with red 
clover, unlefs part fhould be intended- for potatoes, or for rape, fummer vetches, beans or peas.
â€œTwenty-five acres red clover, fummer vetches, rape, potatoes, beans or peas, fown after barley cr 
oats.
The clover to be mowed once, for, if paftured the whole fummer, the land will become foul ; a 
part may be fed at fpring, and mowed late ; but, if any weeds appear, they fhould be cut before it is laid 
up.
The potatoes to be well manured, and twice hoed.
Summer vetches to be cut green, or fed off.
Rape or rye to be fed off.
Beans or peas to be fet or drilled, and twice hoed.
Any of the above will 
be abetter preparation for a wheat feaion, than a fummerâ€™s tilt or fallow.
â€œ By the above fyftem, one-third of the farm will always be in corn, and from not having two fuccefilve 
crops of ccrn, the land can never be worn out or impoverifhed, but will always be in good heart and con-

Housmanâ€™j Notes.
The Editors apologize to Mr. Young for the differences which appear in this contrail; conceiving that a paflengcr 
in the country receives his information without any certainty of the flcill or knowledge of the informer; whereas Mr.
Hodman, who furnifhed the agricultural notes for this work, is a native of the county, was brought up in country em- 
ployments, in which he has gained much experience, and was engaged by the Editors to vifit every parifh, and there 
make his obfervations ; and, by a fufficient refidence in each place, to obtain the fullefl information.
We were induced to 
adopt that expenfive mode of receiving proper deferiptions, from an impreflien, that, in an arra when agriculture was fo 
much attended to in general, when the fcience had made fuch aflonifhing progrefs in the neighbouring county of Nor- 
thumberland, and was ad' ncing progreflively in Cumberland, it was their 'mdifpet fable duty, by a juft reprefentation of the 
ftate of this county, to excite to emulation, thefe who love their native country, and to urge them forward in the im- 
provement of their lands, which is fo great a national as well as local concern : and they flatter themfelves, that any pro- 
lixity on the fubje&, either here or elfewhere, will be pardoned, in confideration of the goodnefs of their motives.

The other one-third in tillage, confiding of turnips, clover, vetches, rape, &c, as above, will 
produce more feed, and fupport more (lock, than the fame quantity of land in grafs will do, and be par- 
ticularly ferviceablc to the farmer for fpring feed.
â€œ All manures, except lime, produce weeds; it is therefore recommended, that the manures be.
always 
laid upon the lands that are cropped with turnips, potatoes, peas or beans, as the hoeing thefe crops 
checks the weeds, and keeps the lands clean.
â€œ Particular care fhould be taken to lay and keep the lands dry, by opening and fcouring the ditches and 
drains ; with gripes and under-drains, where neceffarry.
Lands cannot lay too dry in the winter (whether 
they are cropped or not) as the drier they are at that time, the better the vegetation will be, if iu grafs, 
and the kinder will they work, if in tillage, in the fpring.
â€œ Thefe are the general outlines of that improved fyftem of hufbandry, which, if purfued, will tend 
greatly to the benefit of both landlord and tenant.
Time and fpace will not admit of here entering into 
the minutiae of the bufinefs, neither is it necelfary: when the general fyftem is once underftood, the farm-

There being feveral quarries of Gypfum in this neighbourhood, we have taken fome pains to colleA 
proofs of its virtues as au univerfal manure ; but, from feveral late experiments, made at our inftance, it 
has net come out to what we were led to expeft, we ftiall only infert the following experiments on 
gypfum, by R._Pro6lor Anderfcn, of Henlade, Somerfetfture, (from Youngâ€™s Annals of Agriculture) 
â€œ Henlade, December 28 tb, 1791.
".Laft fpring I procured two hundred weight of alabafter, or gypfum, from a rock at Hurcatt, near 
Somerton, in this county, at 2s.
6d.
per hundred weight at the quarry, which I got beaten to powder 
with hammers, and ran it through a fine hair iieve, or cleanfmg range, and then through a malt mill, 
which was not injured by the operation ; but, to pulverife it on a large fcale in this manner, would be too 
expenfive for the farmerâ€™s practice, if it were to be much ufed for a manure.
. 
â€œ The two hundred weight produced about ten pecks in powder; a peck of powder weighed twenty- 
one pounds ten ounces.
At the rate of fix buftiels to an acre, it would be one and five-eights to a fquare 
yard ; at that rate, five hundred weight is fufficient for an acre, and forty-one pounds allowed for waftc.

per acre ; but there are rocks againft the fea coail near 
Sydmouth, and mod likely on the fea coail in moft parts of the ifiand, which may probably be come at on 
more eafy terms,- The difficulty will be to reduce it to powder at a fmall expence, if it fhould be found 
anfwerable.
â€œ In April and May laft, at different times, in gentle rains, on five different places-, on a clayey foil, 
on a pafture laid down more than twenty years ago with rye-grafs, 1 fowed, in each place, one peck of 
the powder; alfo one peck on lanfoin in its fifth yearâ€™s growth ; or.e peck on young oats ; and one 
peck on fpring vetches or tares 5 all at the rate of fix buftiels per acre, and it has had no apparent effeft 
on either of thefe places.
â€œ But, on the fame day on which I fowed four pecks of the above experiments, viz.
April 1 3th, I fowed 
one and three-fourths of an ounce of this flour of gypfum on a fquare yird of grafs ground where no ftock 
goes, which was laid down 16 years ago, partly with Dutch clover feed.
There (the foil an heavy loam) 
from the middle of May to the end of June, when it was mown, the grafs was greener than that around 
it.
In the beginning of July, flight rains falling, it appeared greener, and, by the end of Auguft, the 
grafs on that fpot was not only greener, but thicker and higher, and the leaves of the Dutch clover 
Broader than on the outfides of it.
Auguft the 31ft, it was mowed again, and the fame appearances 
enfued, and continued until the 10th of November, when it was mowed again.
It is obfervable, that, at 
the time of lowing the gypfum powder, the wind blew S.

<c would endeavour to prevail with the bifhop of the diocefe, to have a chapel 
â€œ built and confecrated there, which would be of perpetual ufe to them and their 
pofterity.â€ " The dean and chapter of Carlifle, as fucceffors of the prior and

This 
the line, and from peg to peg, the powder was blown towards the N.

From hence I conclude, fo 
â€” â€œ That on many plants, gvpfum powder will have no efleft ; but that it has an effect on old clover 
In a loamy foil.
; and that a greater effedt may be reafonably expedled from it, when applied to younger 
plants of the fame fort or nature.
â€œ I forgot to remark, that, trying to boil a final' portion of the powder over a wood lire, to prove its 
goodnefs, it got into a flate of fufion, and admitted a flraw to be thruft to the bottom of an iron pot (in 
which brimftone ufed to be melted) which it would not admit of before it was put over the fire.
It was 
then removed, and put over a ilronger coal fire; the appearance and the fubftance continued as nearly 
the fame as could be ; the veflel in which it was put became red hot.
I have about a peck of the powder 
left, which I fhall make ready to try in the fprmg, in any manner you may recommend.
Pray do yotl 
know any thing of the truth of the experiment of applying this powder to feed oata, lleeped in water, by 
a farmer near Epping, laft fpring, of which there was an account in the public prints ?â€” -I am not inform- 
ed of any fuch experiment.
The experimentâ€™ to be recommended, is for common broad clover.â€ 
Arthur Young, Efq.
(fecretary to the board of agriculture) in a letter to his correfpondent here, in 
1793, fays, â€œ Experiments now feem wâ€™ell to afeertain, that the value of it as a manure is very great 
in a wet feafon, for clover j but for corn or turnips, in general, or for clover in a dry feafon, it has no

[Leath Ward.
This parifh is wholly included within the foreft of Inglewood.
The tenants 
hold by copy of court-roll, under the Duke of Devonfliire.^ There are two ham- 
lets, called Braithwaite and Middlefkeugh, in Leath Ward, and adjoining to Hefket 
on the weft, which are deemed part of the parifh of St. Mary, Carlifle ; conlift- 
ing of about 25 tenements, of which Braithwaite pays a yearly quit-rent to Henry 
Brougham, Elq. of Brougham, in Weftmorland, amounting to 1 61 .
3s.
4^.$ 
and the tenants of Middlefkeugh hold of Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane, Bart.
Adjoining to Hefket church-yard there is a fchooi, which had an endowment 
of 40I.
only, the intereft of which the mafter poftefled, before the revenue was 
augmented by the donation of 200I.
from Mr. Brown.
The moft lingular circumftance that relates to this parifh is, that, yearly, on 
the day of St. Barnabas, the court for the foreft of Inglewood is held there.
The 
fuitors are aflembled in the open air by the highway fide, at the accuftomed place, 
now no otherwife marked than by an ancient thorn;* here attend the inhabitants of 
above twenty inefne manors, from whom, according to the ancient foreft court, 
a jury for the w hole jurifdidlion is balloted and fworn.
Here are paid the annual 
dues to the lord of the foreft, compofitions for improvements, purpreftures, agift- 
ments, and puture of the forefters.

On the moor, on the right hand of the road to Carlifle, are four fmall tumuli, 
fet in a fquare figure ; fome of them have been opened.* 
* We laid it down as a rule to ourfelves, when we fir ft refolved to add to our hiflory, the biography 
of our county, to give an account of thofe perfons only, who had diftinguifhed themfelves, either in fome 
uncommon and extraordinary way, or by fome literary production.
This lias occafioned our pafling, 
without notice, many perfons of great worth and refpe&ability ; and we fhould have done fo in the pre- 
fent inllance, had we not thought an epitaph, written by fo noted a man%s the late Sir John Fielding, 
rather uncommon ; and as fuch deferving our notice.
Thomas Skelton was born in this parifh, and got his education at Queenâ€™s College, Oxon.
He 
was the officiating clergyman, for fome time, in the churches of Newnham, Maplederam, Odiham, and 
Sutton, in the county of Hants ; and during the lall fixteen years of his life, was Vicar of Wakefield, in 
the county of Berks, and mafter of an academy there ; he was uncle to the Rev. William Kirkbride, the 
prefent clergyman of this parifh.
Near this fpot and in the midfl of his family 
is depofited 
the body of the Rev. Thomas Skelton 
late Vicar of this parifh 
' Who died Aug. the 6th 1767 
Aged 72.
During near forty years of his life 
he kept a grammar fchool of the firlt reputation 
in this and the neighbouring 
county 
the duties of which employment 
equally difficult and laborious 
He difeharged with the greateft honour to himfelf 
and 
advantage to others.
He had the rare but happy art 
of fecuring affeftion, even while he infliCled punifhment, 
yet his example 
conveyed more important knowledge 
than his precepts 
His whole life was one great inflruCtion 
how to live 
His integrity was inflexible, his piety examplary 
and though his fpirit was generous 
his induftry was indefatigable.
That being dead he may yet fpeak 
His virtues are here commemorated

who gratefully remember the benefit*

that the fadts which gave birth to the ballad, appear from hiltory, to have taken place between the years

PARISH OF HUTTON.
The manor of Hoton , as it is written in old writings, (which may feem to imply, 
that it was fo called from its having been built on a bow or hill) was anciently 
held of the king in capite, by the fervice of maintaining the paling or fences of the 
kingâ€™s foreft of Plumpton ; and by holding the royal flirrup whilft the fovereign 
mounted his horfe in the callle of Carlifle, and paying yearly into the kingâ€™s 
exchequer at Carlifle 33s.

by the hands of the fheriff.f The refident family 
continued a long time in poffeffion of this manor, and affumed a local name of 
Hutton in horcjla ; for in the reign of King Edward I.
we find one Thomas de 
Hoton in Forrjla , granting lands there.
In the 16th year of King Edward III.
one 
Thomas de Hoton , for his fervices in the Scotch war, was reftored to the bailiwick 
and office of keeping the kingâ€™s land at Plumpton.
In the 1 6th year of King 
Richard II.
William de Hoton held that office, then ftiled Fcrejlarius Regis de Landa

and attainments.
By improving the advantages of a long refidence in France and Italy, he became per- 
fect mailer of the languages of thofe countries, and as well read in their bell authors.
Colle&ing thus, 
a copious treafure of general information, he applied himfelf to the lludy of ihe particular laws of his own

Extent.] About four miles from N.
to S and one mile and a half from E.
to W.
Soil and Produce.] The foil in general is upon a clay, the.
rifing grounds' are of a lighter quality.
Not much wheat is fown in this parifh; partly from an ancient prejudice of the proprietors, but chiefly 
from the lands lying in narrow doles in common fields, where (keep are wintered; oats and barley, the 
chief produce.
The lands are naturally fertile in grafs.
Sheep and Cattle.] About 300 fheep are kept at prefent in this parifn, part of which are fummered 
on La7.onby-fell, and wintered' here.
Horses and Cattle.] Are fomewhat fmalleThere than at Skelton.
â€” About tyo head of deer are 
kept in Sir F- Fletcher Vaneâ€™s park.
BuiLDrNGs.] Not good, mo(l of the houfes thatched.
Commons'.] Good, but not extenfive; the land is low and level, but being wet, does not fuit fheep.
â€” In the late wet years, nearly half of them died of the rot.
â€” It is good for horfes and cattle, being green 
and clear of heath.
Rent-] In the fouthern part the average is about 20s.
per acre, in the northern parts, about Morton, 
14s.
per acre.
AspttT and General Appearance.] The fituation at the fouth end of the parifh, elevated and 
undulating ; at the north end, low and level; and inclining to the E.
and W: There are many beautiful 
plantations about the manfion-houfe, which is well fheltered to the N.
and W.
There is an opening in 
the wood to the call, where the gate way is, by a vifto, which terminates at the deer park, and commands 
a diltunt view of the euftern mountains.
The fouth point is open, but the view not extenfive.

Antiquities.] At Upper Row, on Hutton Common, are the veftiges of Collinfon Cattle, an ancient 
fquare fortification, each fide about ico yards.
The remaining trench is about four feet deep, and 30 
wide.
Near it is an excellent fpring, ftill called Collinfonâ€™ / Well.
No tradition remains concerning the 
eredtion, the demolition, or the intention of this building, except that it was a place of refuge in perilous 
times.
Here has been found feveral hand mill (tones, 13 or i + inches diameter.
There is a tradition, 
that King Charles marched his army by this road, and drank at this well.
Population.
â€” This parilh, in the year 1 756, confided of 65 houfes: in the year 17S1, of 54, which 
contained 248 inhabitants, from a calculation made of the deaths, on an average of ten years, viz.
from 
1771 to 1780, inclulive, it appears, that one in 82 and two thirds of all the inhabitants died annually.
ELFA HILLS.
A range of hills, which, except a few inches at the furface, are compofed entirely of gravel of an ex- 
cellent quality for roads, of which thoufands of cart loads are annually led away.
Here are many vifible 
marks of trenches.
Thefe hills are Angular and detached, extending two furlongs in length, and lefs 
than a fourth of that breadth, and about 25 yards high They are furrounded by low and fvvampy 
ground, and appear artificial ; though that feems improbable.
A human Skeleton was found about 
14 years ago, on the top of thefe hills, which fell to dull in the air.
On the common adjoining, are alfo plain marks of trenches, and very large human bones have been 
accidentally difeovered in the memory of perfons now living, upon Thomas Clofe green.
It is tradi- 
tion whether well or ill founded, that there was an encampment on thefe hills, and that the faid green 
ivas a burying-place for the foldiers, It is not eafy (confidering how imperfect our accouuts of them are) 
to fay, to what people thefe bones could belong.
The Roman ftation, Petriana (Plumpton) is not 
more than three miles diftant ; but as the bones were not burnt, it might be rafh to fuppofe they were 
Roman.
At blencowe-bank, in Hutton common fields, a burying-place was difeovered, out of which were dug, 
about 10 years fince, two urns filled with afhes, but which were not preferved.
This parilh has, in like manner with Skelton, decreafed confiderably in population within the laft 40 
years.

â€œ had iffue Adam, father to Walter the younger, and w ho fold it to Walter

It appears that the Dacres of Gilfland claimed the manerial rights, for in the 
7th Queen Elizabeth, we find Thomas and Elizabeth his wife, granted over the 
manor with the advowfon and retftory to one Daws, &c.
for the life of Elizabeth.
But there is great confuhon in the evidences touching this manor; for the Earl 
of Burlington having title in one fixth part, in right of Elizabeth his wife, heirefs 
of Henry Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, it feems to have defcended by that line 
to the Devonftfire family; and 3I.

of one 13th part was given to the church, in extindlion of tithes for the common.

feaft, which might be transferred under the injunctions of Henry VIII.
from the fummer feafon to Michaelmas.
â€” But 
the circumftance of the chauntry being dedicated to St. Mary, gives the probability the other way; and that is ftrengthened.
by the dedication of the bells, one being infcribed Ave Maria gratia plena , the other SanEle Miclael ora pro nobis; with- 
out we conceive the dedication was to St. Michael and St. Mary jointly.
In 1786, there were 135 families in this parifh, 678 inhabitants.
In 179a, there were 126 families and 631 inhabitants, all of the eftablifhed church.
The decreafe of population may 
be attributed to two recent caufes, the inclofurc of the common lands, which occafioned many cottagers to quit the country, 
who followed an idle or wandering life, and increafed the number of ftrollers and vagrants; and the uncommon progrefs ofc 
manufactories, which induced multitudes to engage their children therein.
It muft reft in the events of time to fhew which 
was the greater evil; and to decide, whether the cultivation of wafte lands and the enlarging of farms will really prove a 
national advantage.
â€” The harvefts on the new inclofed lands here are generally very late, in 1792, 2Tft OCtober, much 
of the corn remained uncut.
The land is cold and wet, and perhaps rather too near the weftern mountains.
Our valuable 
correfpondent, the Rev. S.
Lewthwaite, to whom we owe much information, makes this judicious remark, â€” .â€¢ It is a 
â€œ queftion, whether fuch ground is not rather marked out by the hand of nature, as a pajlure for flocks, than arable land.â€

This is a manor of the Duke of Devonfhire,

death of the tenant, or on his alienation ; but nothing is paid on the death or 
change of lord.
The land-holders alfo have the wood growing on the premifes.
The lands defcend to the heir male, and in failure of fuch iffue, to the females as 
parceners ; and the widow is dowable in one third of all the lands of which her 
hufband was feized after marriage; of which intereft fhe cannot dived: herfelf,

Soil and Produce.] Clay prevails moil.
â€” The northern part of the parifti is more loamy, and moll 
fertile ; the fouthern parts moft expofed, wet, cold, and barren.
The produce, wheat, barley, oats and 
peas ; no turnips, few potatoes, and little clover.
â€” Corn is late in ripening ; but there are, notwithftand- 
ing, good crops, and it is the chief dependence of the farmer.
A great trail of cultivated common land* 
inclofed about 26yeatsago, when firft broken up, produced luxuriant crops, which continued for feveral 
years ; at length it became remarkably barren, being exhaufted, as the farmers imagine from conftant lim- 
ing, in too long a courfe of tillage.
But, as the idea of effete, or worn-out lands, is perfectly unphilofa- 
phical, a little more attention and experience will drew them how their prefent erroneous fyftem of ex- 
ceflive ploughing and liming may eafily be remedied.

[Leath Ward.
In the village of Southernby, is the feat of J.
Fallowfield (author of various 
mifcellaneous eflays and poems) fnuated on the weft fide of Hewinhill.
The 
buildings and gardens ftand on a part of what was called the Town-green, be- 
fore the commons were inclofed, and are laid out on inclining ground, fo as to 
command a beautiful profpecft.
The fruit-trees, fhrubs &c.
are well chofen for 
the climate, and are in a very flourifhing ftate.
This is an example of what 
great improvement the lands are capable, when under the hands of a judicious 
cultivator.
Raughton-head Chapel (or Roe-town-head, fo called, mod probably, from 
the fmall river Raw, or Rowe that runs near it) in this parifh, after lying long in 
ruins, was rebuilt in 1678, and confecrated by Bifhop Rainbow.
It was a fecond 
time rebuilt, at the expence of the inhabitants in 1760, in order to render it com- 
Antiquities.] On Caftle-hill are the remains of an old fortrefs.
Aspect and General Appearance.] The fituation elevated, the lands incline to the eaft and 
north.
â€” A heavy foil.
â€” Quickfet hedges, and oak wood in hedge rows, &c.â€” Wood abounds molt in 
the northern part, where alinoft every hedge is, planted, fo that at a diftance, the country looks like a 
park or for eft.
Housmanâ€™s Notes.
Antiquities.] In the diftrift of How-Bound, is a lofty hill called the Caftle-hill, from whence 
Sowerby has moft probably taken the name of Cajile Sowerby.
On the top, the rock has been dug into, 
and tradition fays, it was fortified with a pallifado, or out-works of wood: on the north and weft fides, 
fpacious ways have been cut in the rock, leading to the fummit: and at a few yards diftance, there is a 
circular cavity formed in the rock, about 18 yards in diameter, the entrance about three feet in width ; 
there were iron crooks, which ftiew that it was ftiut up in times of danger, perhaps to fecure the cattle 
againft the borderers.
This hill, is part of one of the ten principal eftates in the parilh, formerly called Red- fpears ; the 
owners of thefe lands, did their lingular fervice by riding through the town of Penrith on Whitfun- 
, Tuefday brandifhing their fpears.
Thefe were of the order of Red-knights, mentioned in our law-books: 
a name derived from the Saxon Rad Equitatus and Cynt minifter , who held their lands, by ferving the 
lord on horfeback.

In times of peace, it is prefumed they held 
the annual fervice above noted, to challenge the enemies of their country, or thofe who might difpute the 
title of the lord, iimilar to the parade of the champion of England.
The fpears were about nine feet in 
length, and till within this century, fome of them remained in the proprietors houfes, where they were 
ufually depofited.
Thefe Red-Spsarj were fureties to the fheriff for the peaceable behaviour of the reft 
of the inhabitants.
The ancient owners of the eftate now particular)â€™ noted, (and the prefent owner, Mr.
James Ellwood, of Wharton houfe) annually l'erved a* jurors at the forelt court, held near Helket, on St.
Barnabas day, by which they were exempted from all parilh offices.
Sowerby common anciently abounded in oak wood ; on breaking up of the land, a great number of 
pit-fteads were found, where the wood had been reduced to charcoal: Iimilar appearances have been dis- 
covered in Broadfield common.
There were two ftone erodes on the common, which in many places are called Corps Croffes, where 
the corps was refted, on its being borne to the church, and according to the ancient formulary, a ffiort 
prayer was offered up.
How-hill, which, it may be prefumed, gave name to the diftrift, called from thence How-Bound, bears 
fome remarkable traces of diftant antiquity.
On the crown of this hill, is a circular inclofure, mounded 
with ftone and earth about 21 yards in diameter, with an opening, or entrance, on the fouth lide; large 
oaks have grown tlnough the mound.
We may give a fuller account of the antiquities of this parilh, 
and deferibe them, when we treat of the largeft monumi nt of this kind in the county, fituated on 
Carrock-fell, in the parifh of Caldbeck.

Bifhop Ofbaldifion ufurped the power of nominating, in the inftance 
of Mr. Bew'ley, but that pretended right has been relinquifhed.
It is reported to 
us, that few places of public worfhip, are better attended than this: part of which 
laudable exercife of duty, we hope, may be duly attributed to the propriety 6f the 
minifter.
The fuccefiion 6f chaplains, reported to us, is as follows: Jo. Sharpies â€” Rich.

There is one manor within this chapelry belonging to William Blamir.e, Efq.
of Oaks, in the parifh of Dalfion.
There are no common lands within the chapelry, and the efiates are not large; 
few above tool, a-year, and many only iol.
a year.
The fituation of Raughton-head is admirable.
The fouthern profpcdt from 
thence, contains a beautiful fcene of cultivated lands, bounded by Carrick and 
Caldbeck fells.
To the weft, you have a view of the bifhopâ€™s palace of Rofe, and 
the banks of the river Caldew, To the north, is a fine cultivated tradt, graced 
with Holme-hill: and to the eaft looking upon Inglewood foreft, you have the

Adjoining to the chapel-yard, a fchool-houfe was eredted in 1744, by Mr. John 
Head of Foxley-henning ; the patronage of the fchool, is in the before-mentioned 
twelve truftees.
An endowment of 20L was left by will, in 1762, by Mr. Sevith-

tained 198 inhabitants.
From a calculation made of the deaths, on an average of ten years, viz.
from 
1771 to 1780 inclufive it appears that one in 28 2-7ths of all the inhabitants of this paridi dies annually.
It mud here be remarked, that Hutton and Newton are adjoining parilhes, and both very fmall, yet the 
former during the period of ten years, from 1771 to 1780, appears to have been the mod healthy of 
all the parilhes in the county, which I have examined, and the latter the mod unhealthy, At fird I 
imagined fome error might have happened in tranferibing the regiders.
They were re-examined, but no 
error appeared.
Both regiders feemed alfo to be perfedt and regular.
It then occured to me, that it 
was poffible, fome fatal epidemic, or the fmall pox, might have raged in Newton, which Hutton had 
efcaped.
This, however was not the cafe, nor does it appear that any of the inhabitants of Hutton 
had been buried in Newton, during the pariod alluded to.
How, therefore, to account for this remark- 
able difference in the falubrity of the two parifhes, I know not.
â€” Upon an average, each houfe in Leatlv 
Ward, contains 4 3'4ths perfons; and upon an average, one perfon in 56 2-3ds, dies annually.
For the fake of connexion in the further profecution of this work, we proceed 
to the Parish of Millum.

THE PARISH OF MILLUMf 
(in allerdale ward above derwlnt) 
C OMPREHENDS the whole of the peninfula formed by an arm of the fea 
breaking up the channel of the river Dudden, which is the boundary of the 
county on the fouth, as the ocean is on the weft.
Great part of this parifn lies on a fiat, and is expofed to a torrent of air that 
rulhes up the gulph, from the Irifh channel; fo that the lands are diftrcffed with 
two natural evils, beating rains, and, in dry weather, driving and overwhelming 
fands, which are carried by the winds to an amazing diftance; both which are 
great enemies to cultivation, and hurt the ordinary vegetation.
The Castle of Milium has been ncgle&ed for many ages; it has chiefly con- 
lifted cf one large fquare tower, embrazured, and guarded with corner turrets ; 
the whole defended by a curtain wall and deep foffe.
The outworks are not now 
to be traced, as ftables and out-houfes for the farmholds are placed round the 
tower ; the caftle being occupied by the farmer of the lands .
â€” â€œ Amongft the 
manors pertaining to the barony of Egremont, the lordfhip or feigniory of Milium , 
(in the fouth-weft corner of the faid barony) is the firft, and of greateft liberties, 
containing alfo in itfelf divers manors, which are holden of Milium, (as Milium, 
is of Egremont) immediately, with fome difference of fervice.
â€œ This manor reacheth from the river of Dudden into Elk, ten long miles in 
length, and from the weft fea up into the mountains above the manor of Thwaites 
about fix miles in breadth, in form triangular.
It is moft inhabited along the 
rivers of Dudden and Efk, and on the fea coaft: the reft is foreft ground, hills 
and great mountains, beft fitting for fheep pafture.
â€œ Milium Caftle, the ancient feat and capital manfion of this manor, is placed 
at the foot of the river Dudden, and through length of time threatens ruin.
Howbeit the lords thereof make it ftill their dwelling place and abode, holding 
themfelves content, that the old manner of rtrong building there, with the goodly 
demefnes and commodities which both land and fea afford them, and the ftately 
parks full of huge oaks and timber woods, and fallow deer, do better witnefstheir 
ancient and prefent greatnefs and worth, than the painted vanities of our times 
do grace our new upftarts.
â€œ This great manor, in the time of king Henry I.
was given by William 
Mefchines, Lord of Egremont, to***** de Boyvill, father to Godard de Boyvill, 
(named in ancient evidences Godardus Dapifer) who, being of Milium, did give 
unto the abbot and monks of Furnefs a carucate of land there, with the appurte- 
nances, called yet to this day Monk torce , which Arthur, the fon of Godard, con- 
firmed unto the abbey, and after him, in like fort, his fon and heir, Henry, the 
fon of Arthur, referving only the harts and hinds, wild boars and their kinds, and 
all aries of hawks.

And for a recognition of the grant made to the Boyvills, Arthur, and Henry his 
fon, by Dame Cicely, the Countefs, they paid to King Henry II.
for a poft fine, 
one hundred pounds, and five couple of hounds, the records terming them, decern 
fugatores.
And an old tradition makes thefe Boyvills to have been very near of 
kin to the Lords of Egremont, and gives us an account of the occafion upon which 
Milium was transferred to the faid Boyvills, which is faid to be thus ; the Baron 
of Egremont being taken prifoner beyond the feas by the infidels, could not be 
redeemed without a great ranfom, and being for England, entered his brother 
or kinfman for his furety, promifing, with all poftible'fpeed, to fend him money to 
fet him free; but upon his return home to Egremont, he changed his mind, and 
moft unnaturally and unthankfully fuffered his brother to lie in prifon, in great 
diftrefs and extremity, until the hair was grown to an unufual length, like to a 
womanâ€™s hair.
The Pagans being out of hopes of the ranfom, in great rage 
moft cruelly hanged up their pledge, binding the long hair of his head to a beam 
in the prifon, and tied his hands fo behind him, that he could not reach to the 
top where the knot was faftned to loofe himfelf: during his imprifonment, the 
Paynimâ€™s daughter became enamoured of him, and fought all good means for his 
deliverance, but could not enlarge him : (he underftanding of this laft cruelty by 
means made to his keeper, entered the prifon, and taking her knife to cut the hair, 
being haftened, fhe cut the fkin of his head, fe as, with the weight of his body, he 
rent away the reft, and fell down to the earth half dead ; but fhe prefently took 
him up, caufing furgeons to attend himfecretly, till he recovered his former health 
beauty, and ftrength, and fo entreated her father for him, that he fet him at liberty.
Then, defirous to revenge his brotherâ€™s ingratitude, he got leave to depart to his 
country, and took home with him the hatterell of his hair, rent off as aforefaid, 
and a bugle-horn, which he commonly ufed to carry about him, when he was in 
England, where he fhortly arrived, and coming towards Egremont Caftle about 
noontide of the day, where his brother was at dinner, he blew his bugle-horn, 
which (fays the tradition) his brother the baron prefently acknowledged, and 
thereby conjeeftured his brotherâ€™s return ; and then fending his friends and fervants 
to learn his brotherâ€™s mind to him, and how he had efcaped, they brought back the 
report of all the miferable torment which he had endured for his unfaithful 
brother the baron, which fo aftonifhed the baron (half dead before with the 
fhameful remembrance of his own difloyalry and breach of promife) that he 
abandoned all company, and would not look on his brother till his juft: wrath was 
pacified by diligent entreaty of the friends.
And to be fure of his brotherâ€™s

Where-

â€œ But whatever the occafion of the grant was, the Boyvills were from the place 
called de Milium, and have anciently held the fame with great liberties, and had 
Jura Rcpaha there.

â€œ The firft Boyvill gave to his fecond fon, William Boyvill, the manor of

â€” but Seaton is 
now the inheritance of John Pennington, Gentleman.
<f The dead of feofment, made by the faid Henry F'itz Arthur to Goynhild

This feigniory anciently held extenfive privileges, being of very great confe-

bited, and fo much negleded, that it is difufed.
Though the lordfhip is thus 
feated on an ifihmus, and almoft furrounded with water, yet there is no port or 
creek for fhips within its extenfive limits.
We faw three or four hulks laying 
ftranded in the channel of Dudden, which are employed in carrying lime and fea 
ware, and bringing up coals for the inhabitants.
The family of Boyvills, like mofi of the great ones of this county, terminated in 
a female heir, by whofe intermarriage with Sir John Huddleflon, Knight, the 
ancient feigniory of Milium was transferred to that family, in the time of King 
Edward I.
Sir John was a native of the fame feigniory, being a defeendant of 
the Lords of Anneys, in Milium, whofe anceRors arc traced in lineal fucceflion to 
a much higher antiquity than the conqueft.
This family alfo determined in female iffue, having pofTeffed Milium, to within 
a few years pad, when Elizabeth the daughter and heirefs of William Huddleflon, 
Efq. by her marriage with Sir Hedworth Williamfon, of the county of Durham, 
Baronet, transferred this extenfive territory to a new family.
Sir Hedworth and 
her ladyfhip, about the year 1774, fold theefiates to the prefent Earl of Lonfdale, 
for upwards of 20,0001.
We were informed of a projed Lord Lonfdale entertained of banking againft 
the fea on the extenfive fands of Milium.
It is an undertaking well fuited to his 
opulence; is very pradicable, and W'ould gain him a large trad of land: the tide, 
on thefe long extended lhoals, does not ruih forward with the impetuofity of the 
eaflern or German ocean, but dies languidly on the fands.
When there is a florm 
in the Irilh channel, it chiefly follows a current which afteds that fea, and does 
not burft upon the fhores, as is experienced on the eaflern fide of this ifland.
In 
men of fuch extenfive fortunes, a tafle for fuch improvements proves a great 
blefling to the people; by employing the induflrious poor, and alfo adding to the 
opulence of the country w here the work is performed, as well as to the Rate at 
large.
There is one confiderable advantage this ancient eRate of Milium would 
derive from fuch a work : by fencing and planting, it would in a great meafure 
prevent thofe vaR volumes of dry fand, being fnatched up by tempeRs, which 
overwhelm the adjacent fields, and impoverifh the foil.
By experience, it has 
been proved, that fuch fands as thofe of Milium, -when kept from the vraihing of 
the fea, foon gain a furface fit for vegetation, by the efTeds of fummer funs and 
winter frofis; and under a peculiar mode of hufbandry, are brought to afford 
delicious paflurage.
But the chief advantage to be derived to the ancient eRate, 
would be confining the channel of the river, fo as to gain fafe riding for fmall 
veffels, to carry on fome degree of traffic.
In the neighbourhood or Milium, at a place called S , voivfide i in the eRate of 
William Lewihwaite, Efq. of Whitehaven, is a fmall but beautiful druidical 
monument; it is circular, about twenty yards in diameter; the Rones of which 
it is compofed are from fix to eight feet high, all fiandingand complete.
A little 
to the fouth, is another of larger dimenfions, but not in fo perfed a Rate: the 
neighbouring people call thofe places by the emphatical names of Sunken Kirks.
At a place called Kirkjanton , is a fmall tumulus, on the fummit of which arc

â€” An Account of a Cataftrophe on pafiing Cartmel Sands.
â€œAn old fiftierman mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of palling thefe fands) told 
me, in his dialeft, a moving llory; how a brother of the tiade, a cockier as he {filed him, driving a 
â€œ little cart with his two daughters, women grown, in it, and his wife on horfeback following, fet out 
â€œ one day to pafs the feven mile fands, as they had frequently been ufed to do ; for no body in the vil- 
â€œ lage knew them better than the old man did ; when they were about half way ovei, a thick fog rofe,

â€œ puzzled; â€” he flopped, and fa id, he would go a little way, and find fome mark he was acquainted with ; 
â€œ they flaid a while for him, but in vain; â€” they called aloud, but no reply: â€” at laft the young women 
â€œ preffed their mother to think where they were and go on: â€” fhe would not leave the place; â€” file wan-

Weil, in his hiftory of Furnefs Abbey, informs us, that.
â€œ In the month of 
u March, 1771, the labourers, in forming the new road, uncovered about eight 
â€œ roods of the Roman road : it ran clofe by the fence, oppofite to Mountbarrow 
â€œ hou.fe, where it lay concealed under what had been thrown afide, in clearing 
,f or repairing the road.
It was a regular pavement, conftrudted with coble 
Hones, fet in gravel, and the outfide fupported and bound by large boulders.
u Under Bardfey-park-wall, another inconsiderable part of the pavement, hath 
ct been fince difcovered.â€ â€œ The account of Agricolaâ€™s fecond campaign, the 
** Roman road pointing at Dalton, the tumulus at Mountbarrow houfe, the Ro- 
** man brafs veflel, found laft fummer at Urfwick, and the nature of the fituation 
â€œ of the fort at Dalton, ate circumftances which warrant a fuppofiton, that 
â€œ Agricola had vifited and reduced Furnefs, in the fummer of his fecond cam- 
â€œ paign, 7^ ; and that he, or fome fuccelfor, had eredted a Cafteilum at Dalton.â€ 
From its fituation, Furnefs was excellently calculated for beacons, to alarm the 
Lancafhire coaft, and to communicate fignals received from the heights in Cum- 
berland, which fhould give notice of an enemyâ€™s approach by fea or land.
In 
confequence, the places of feveral ancient beacons are fhewn at this day.
The 
antiquity of the cuftom is not doubted; and that the Romans, in this part of Bri- 
tain, ufed them; nothing could be more important to the ftation at Lancafter, 
than a beacon on the foreland of Furnefs.
Although it has been infilled on, by feveral writers, that Dalton w'as a fmall 
Roman fort; yet no coins, infcriptions, or other Roman remains have been dis- 
covered to determine the fadt: on the eaft fide of the church yard, are the traces 
of a ditch and rampart, but little can be determined from thence.
The Romans 
were, no doubt, well acquainted with Furnefs.

was wrought in the quarries at Dalton.
The Saxons did not, for fome time, after the departure of the Romans, poffefs 
this fequeftered tradt.
Camden fays here, â€œ The Britons lived fecurely for a long 
time, relying upon thefe fortifications, wherewith nature had guarded them, but 
nothing proved impregnable to the Saxon conqueror : for that the Britons lived 
here in the 228th year of the coming of the Saxons, is plain from hence, that 
at that time, Egfrid, king of the Northumbrians, gave to St. Cuthbert, the lands 
called Cartmel, and all the Britons in it, for fo it is related in his life.
If in 
Ptolemy, one might read Jetantiorum aimnh (a lake) as fome books have it ; and

ULVERSTON 
Is a neat little market-town, fituated on the declivity of a hill towards the fouth.
Weft, in his peculiar language, calls this place the Emporium, the London, the

ficence, the mod of them being habitations of men of trade, whofe bufinefs is 
chiefly confined to the produce of this little diftrieft.
The ftreets are well paved 
and kept clean.
In the 9 th year of King Edward 1.
Ulverfton had a grant of a 
weekly market on Thurfday, and an annual fair: but thefe were little ufed, 
* c whilft the Abbey of F'urnefs fubfifted.â€ The Abbey occafioned the chief 
concourfe of people; trade was then almoft infignificant to the inhabitant, who 
either wafted his life in the indolence of a monaftery, or in vaflalage to the reli- 
gious community.
Thofe who had dealings with the monaftery, chofe to refide 
rear it; and Dalton, from its vicinity, was the more commodious place for hold- 
ing a market.
Thefe coafts knew little trade or navigation, before the diflolution 
of abbeys: from that period, the minds of men took another turn, but the ad- 
vancement was flow ; and the cultivation of lands, for a confiderable time, con- 
tinued at a very low ebb.
At length, when trade became an object with the 
inhabitants of Furnefs, Ulverfton grew into importance ; Dalton, in confequence, 
declined.
The revenue, which was yearly diftipated by the religious, and the 
money w hich travellers expended, who vifited the Abbey, were channels of wealth 
which were done away by the dilfolution of the houfe; Dalton, of confequence, 
loft its importance.

Compofts of lime and foil are much ufed.
A great part of the land here feems very proper for producing turnips, but the farmers are very ignorant

What ftruck me mod, was their large unweildly ploughs, ufed with a wheel fixed to the beam, upon 
all grounds indifcriminately, and drawn by four ftout horfes, which neceflarily employs a driver.
This, 
I find, is generally the praftice, not only on ftiff grounds, but alio fallows.
It is retnaikable, that this 
old cuftom is ftill followed; one would conceive, that the expciice of keeping two additional horfes, and 
maintaining a driver foi every plough, would foon make the people weary of a fooliih cuftom.
The only 
reafon alfigned by the farmers for uiing four horfes in a plough, is the number of ftones and ftitfnefs of the 
foil, fuppofing that two horfes are unequal to the labour; but this, in general, is a molt egregious mif- 
take, and the mere efteft of prejudice and inexperience.
Minerals.] Iron ore is got in large quantities, alfo blue flate.
In Low Furnefs limeftone abounds.
Trade and Manufactures.] A canal is now cutting from the fand to Ulverfton, which is expefted

1. â€¢ 3 Z Furnefs 
FURNESS ABBEY, 
Furnefs, ought certainly to be eftimated in another manner; whilfr it was the 
feat of fecular powers, exercifed by an eccleftaftic; whilft its honours or confe- 
quence depended on the profufion of the religious houfe ; and whilft it fuffered 
all the ignominious fervilities of thofe unhappy ages, in which the feudal tenures 
prevailed, and other degrees of vaflalage, which it mull have experienced, from 
its unpropitious vicinage, it might literally be ftiled the Jhame of Furnefs: but now, 
whilft this loathfome prifon finks in ruins, when trade and agricultuje, proceeding 
from the hands of liberty, enrich the furrounding country ; and whilft Dalton lifts 
its head from the eminence, to be feen from afar, by an opulent and unreftrained 
people, it has a right to a better denomination, though not entitled to the eminent 
one of the pride of Furnefs.
But Mr. Weft and we formed different eftimates, 
from different prejudices.
The lands on every hand, are rich and well cultivated : yet, a new fyftem in 
theif tenures would enable the occupier to bring them to a higher ftate of per- 
fection; of which idea we cannot further infift in this place, than from the general 
eftimate, that all lands which are intercommon, and open doled fields, are cer- 
tainly, to a degree, in a ftate of wafte, and far from being brought to the utmoft 
profit.;}: 
After travelling about a mile from Dalton, we approached the vale where the 
ABBEY ftands.
After crofting a brook, whofe waters flow through the inclofed 
area of the monaftery, we entered a narrow dell, pent in, on each hand, by hills 
of a confiderable height; along which, lies the approach to the facred pile from 
the north.
The vale is marftiy, and the whole fituation is confined and gloomy.
When the country was more wooded, and the roads traded by fewer carriages, 
f â€œ One general obftacle to the improvement of Furnefs, and the advancement of agriculture in it, is 
the mixed lands, or townfhip fields.
Every whole tenement, befides the cuftomary annual rent, was 
charged with the obligation of having in readinefs a man completely armed for the kingâ€™s fervice, on the 
border or elfewhere.
Of thefe there were 60 in Plain Furnefs.
When the abbot of Furnefs franchifed 
his villains, and raifed them to the dignity of cuftomary tenants, the lands they had cultivated for their 
lord were divided into whole tenements, which were again fubdivided into four equal parts: each villain had 
one, and the party tenant contributed his fhare in fupporting the man at arm9, and other burthens.
Thefe divifions were not properly diftinguifhed; the land remained mixed: each tenant had a fhare 
through all the arable and meadow land, and common of pafture over all the waftes, was deemed a prin- 
cipal tenant, and paid a fine upon his admittance.
Thefe fubtenements were judged fufficient for the fup- 
port of fo many families, and no further divifion was permitted.
Thefe divifions and fubdivifions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated; the land 
fo parcelled out, was of neccifity more attended to, and the induftry greater where more perfons were to 
be fupported by the produce of it: the frontier of this kingdom (within which Furnefs was confidered) 
was in a conftant ftate of attack or defence, more hands were therefore neceffary to guard the coaft, repel 
an invafion from Scotland, or make reprifals on the hoftile neighbour.
The dividing the lands in fuch 
manner as has been fhewn, increafed the number of inhabitants, and kept them at home till called for: 
and the land being mixed, and feveral tenants united in equipping a plough, the abfence of the fourth 
man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which was commmitted to the care of three.
And

fliut in by dangerous (bores and (hifting fands, this was a fecure feat for a religi- 
ous community.
About the middle of this narrow dell, the abbey is placed; it is 
enlarged, and opens more to the fouth, but is every where darkfome and folernn, 
with little of the romantic.
The natural produce of the foil was nightfhade, which gave it the name of Be- 
kanâ€™s Gill;* in modern language, rendered more harmonious to the ear, now called 
The Vale of Nightshade.
The edifice occupies almoff the whole breadth of 
the vale; the Bone, of which the buildings are conffruCted, feems to have been 
gotten from the wefiern banks, which, at the diftance of a very few yards, overlook 
the whole abbey and its offices.
There is very little ornament difplayed here; 
and it is to be remarked, that other houfcs of Ciffercians, founded at or near the 
fame aera, are not marked with much embellifhment ; but there is a grave and 
fimple tafie, and plain order, runs through the whole.
The affertion, that the eaB 
end of the church feems to have been an additional part, intended for a belfrey, 
to eafe the main tower,Â§ is certainly an error of the prefs, and in no wife corre- 
fponds with the prefent Bate of the ruins.
In regard to the magnitude of this 
edifice, it was the fecond in England of that order of religious, and next to Foun- 
tains for revenue.
We entered by the gateway of the porterâ€™s lodge; a circular arch, with fev?
members, of heavy architecture.
The manor houfe Bands upon the north wall of 
the abbey-yard, near to this gateway ; and fome parts of it appear to have been 
cotemporary with the abbey ; and probably it was occupied by the fecular fervants 
of the monaBery.
We palled immediately to the eaB front of the church, and, 
by climbing the adjacent hill, gained as general a view of the remains, as we could 
poflibly obtain.
From this Bation, we looked into the chancel and nave, and faw the open arches 
of the tranfept, with the fine remains of the chapter-houfe to the left.
The church 
is, in length, 287 feet v.â€™ithin; the choir is 28 feet wide, and 63 feet long; and the 
great eaB window is about 23 feet wide and 36 feet high, to the fpring of the 
arch, which is broken down, but its remaining members denote, that the arch was 
lancet or pointed ; the moulding confiBs of a few members, with a roll about a foot 
diBant, whofe points terminate at two buBs in relief, well executed; the one 
crowned, the other bearing a coronet: one of the figures, we prefume, reprefents 
King Henry I.
in whofe reign the houfe was founded ; and the other the founder, 
Stephen, Earl of Morton and Bulloign, afterwards King of England : WeB ap- 
prehended they were the bufls of Stephen, and Maud his Queen.
Â£ Thefe are the 
only Batuary fculptures we obferved about the building.
The eaB end of the 
church is fupported by buttrefles, diminifhing in tiers ; the greateB projection of 
which does not exceed five feet.
The high altar Bood detached from the win- 
dow, a fufficient diBance to allow (pace for a circumambulatory neceflary for the

wall, to the fouth, are five flails or niches in elegant flone-work ; that nearefl to 
the altar the mod fpacious, having a nich on each hand, feparated from the flail 
by light pilaflers, where the ciflern for the priefls was fixed.
In the other flails, 
the officiating priefls fat, at intervals, to refl.
The crowns of t'nefe flails are richly 
canopied, embelhfhed with interfering groins and rofe-knots; and the whole is 
finifhed above with light and well-executed pinnacles, in tabernacle-work.
Befides 
the great window to the eafl, the choir was lighted by two large windows to the 
north, of pointed arches, furnifhed with fmall pilaflers ; and two leffer windows, on 
the oppofite fide, above the flails.
The pavement of the floor appears to have been 
broken up, the whole being grown over with grafs and weeds.
The mutilated effi- 
gy of a man in armour, wfiha fhield not blazoned, cut in blue marble, lies in the 
middle of the choir; the perfonage interred not known.
Perhaps this was the tomb 
of Sir Michael le Fleming, the fecond benefactor of the houfe, who was interred 
here; or William de Lancafter, one of the barons of Kendal, who alfo lies in 
this place.
The pijcina , or ciflern, where the priefls wafhed before fervice, was 
placed in the larger flail, as before obferved.
The manulergium hung over the 
fmall nich on each fide of the ciflern, for receiving the purificatores.
Behind thefe 
flails was the reveftry, which w r as entered from the chapels on the eafl front of the 
tranfept.
There were five altars in the church, befides the high altar, each pla- 
ced in a diftindt chapel or apartment, feparate from the main body of the church.
The tranfept is 130 feet in length, and 27 feet wide within; the arches are low, 
and pointed with few members of moulding, rifing from fhort cluflered pillars, 
whofe capitals are compofed of two plain, but feparated, rolls.
The whole eaflern 
front contained chapels ; thofe on the north end were entered by three arches 
pointed, having feveral fmall mouldings ; thofe on the fouth end, by two arches 
circular, having feveral mouldings: confequently thofe chapels were lighted with 
an equal number of windows.
The chapels are now totally pulled down, and the 
pillars and arches of the tranfept are open to view.
The walls of the vellry-room 
are alfo levelled with the ground, and the plot is grown with fhrubs.
In the 
corners of the north end of the tranfept, were the winding flairs which led up in- 
to the galleries.
The great entrance, at the north end of the tranfept, is by a 
circular arch, with many mouldings, the gateway remarkably low ; and, inflead of 
being placed immediately under the great window there, it hands beneath one 
jamb of it: the fancy of the architect, in this matter, was as unaccountable, as the 
crooked appearance is difagreeable.
The centre tower, which now is levelled 
with the fide walls, has been fupported on four pillars, with pointed arches: the 
arch above the entrance into the choir lliil remaining, of beautiful form and pro- 
portion, hanging together by its jullnefs of workmanfhip, without any fuperftruc- 
ture.
Three of thele pillars are cluflered, but very light; the fourth is fquare and 
heavy, the fides cut into dices.
From the fouth weft corner of the tranfept, is a 
door- way, under a pointed arch, which led from the dormitory, for the conveni- 
ent admittance of the religious to matins.
There is no other remains of the nave, 
but part of the fouth wall : the north wall, and the columns which formed the fide 
ailes, are all down; but, from the pilaflers on the fouth wall, one may compute 
the number of pillars which formed theailcs; and, from their diftances, on a given 
fquare.

fquare, calculate the width of the ailes.
The groined roofs of the ailes and nave, 
have been fupported on eight pillars, and two terminating pilafters on each fide; 
thence we conceive, that the ailes were about 16 feet wide, the whole width being 
feventy feet: the wall is about 54 feet high.
What was the form of the pillars 
of the nave, or whether they were uniform, we could not trace; but, from the 
pilafiers, are induced to believe, they were cluttered, with capitals, like thofe in the 
tranfept.
The belfrey ftands at the weft end of the church, a detached tower, 
very ttrong and heavy, the buttreftes projecting about eleven feet; the weft wall 
is ten feet in thicknefs.
There is an unaccountable variation in the dimenfions of 
the walls of this church ; in fome parts they are five feet thick, in others fix, and 
in others only four feet.
At the fouth eaft corner of the nave, an arched door leads into the area, which 
is a parallelogram, in length 334 feet, and in width 102; exclufive of a cloifter on 
the weft fide, which was 31 feet and upwards in width; now totally ruined: there 
was alfo a fhed round this court for proceflions.
Adjoining to the fouth end of the tranfept, ftand the remains of the chapter houfe, 
fixty feet in length, and forty five feet fix inches in w'idth.
â€” â€œ The vaulted roof, 
" formed of twelve ribbed arches, was fupported by fix pillars, in two row's, at 
,c thirteen feet diftance from each other, and the fide walls ; fuppofing each pillar 
,f two feet diameter, which divided the room into three alleys, or paflages, of 
â€œ thirteen feet wide.
At the entrance, the middle only could be feen, lighted 
â€œ by a pair of tall pointed windows at the upper end of the room; the com- 
â€œ pany in the fide paflage would be concealed by the pillars, and the vaulted roof, 
â€œ that groined from thofe pillars would have a true Gothic difproportioned ap- 
â€œ pearance, of fixty feet by thirteen.
The two fide alleys were lighted each by 
â€œ a pair of fimilar lights, befides a pair on each fide at the upper end, at pre- 
â€œ fent entire, and illuftrate w hat is here faid.
Thus, whilft the upper end of the 
â€œ room had a profufion of light, the lower end would be in the fhade.
The no- 
** ble roof of this fingular edifice did but lately fall in; the entrance or porch is 
â€œ ftill up, a fine circular arch, beautified with a deep cornice, as alfo a portico on 
** each fide.â€* The roof, which is described above, had fallen in before w T e vifit- 
ecl the remains.
Above the chapter houfe were the library and feriptorium.
By 
the porch, and entrance into this part of the edifice from the court, and the porticoes 
cn each fide, one niay prefume the infide w j as once highly finifhed; for tfiefe are era- 
bellifhed with a bold cornice, and pilarters of marble.
The eaft front is divided into 
fix windows, in couples, which are feparated only by a mullion, moulded with the 
fame members as the arch of the wâ€™indow ; each couple is feparated from the other 
by a pillar, in the front of which is a femi-odagonal buttrefs, terminating a little 
above the height of the w indows in a point.
The mafonry of this front has been 
excellent.
Two window's, of the fame form, open on the north and fouth fides.
To the fouth of the chapter houfe, and equal to the length of that fide of the 
court, flood the kitchen and other offices ; immediately under the centre of which, a 
branch of the rivulet is brought by a wide arched conduit, that formed an excellent 
common fhore to the houfe.
Over thefe, according to Weftâ€™s account,, were the

lodgings for fome of the fecular fervants of the monaftery.
Immediately to the 
fouth of the chapter houfe, and adjoining thereto, was the refedory, a large and 
commodious apartment, covered with a roof of groined arches ; and near to it 
were the locutorium, calefactory, and converfation room.
The ufe of the converfa- 
tion room, was one of the great indulgences and relaxations of the monks of 
this order; â€œ for thofe who attended the church fervice, were confined to ftrid 
filence, and ftrait inclofure: the times for converfation were after dinner, in the 
* c locutorium or converfation room, and on fome paticular days, when they had 
fC liberty to walk abroad in company, for exercife and relaxation ; they being but 
â€œ fcldom permitted to receive or return vifits.â€Â§ 
At the fouth end of thefe buildings, and out of the inclofure of the area, is ano- 
ther building, the vaulted roof of which remains, of excellent mafonry; formed by 
interfering groins, fpringing from pilafiers in the fide walls; the arching, within 
the groin, is compofed of thin flate ftones, like the roof of many ancient churches, 
and particularly of the choir of Mailrofs abbey; but the groins there are rather 
lighter than at Furnefs.
This is fuppofed to be the fchool-houfe, where the chil- 
dren of the abbeytenants were educated : one of the pillars, on the fouth-eaft 
corner, fhevvs breaks and marks, as if a pulpit for the teacher had been fixed to 
it : a ftone bench is formed all round the room.
Above the pafiage to this place, 
there were feveral fmall apartments.
A vvater-courfe, arched over, v/as brought from the weft fide of the area, under 
the fchool-houfe, and delivered into the brook on the eaft, near to the place where 
the ruins of the mill and bakehoufe are.
Nothing could be more excellent for 
cleanlinefs, pleafure, and health, than thefe aquaduds,- by the arched coverings of 
which, all dampth was prevented affeding the fuperftrudures.
Having deferibed the remains of this religious houfe in their prefent ftate, we 
muft detain the reader, to attend to a fhort account of the order of the monks who 
were placed here, and their manner of life; and alfo to the foundation of the houfe, 
and the feveral donations thereto.
The monks who fettled here, came from the monaftery of Savigny, with 
EwanuSy their chief or leader; they took up their firft refidence at Tulket, near 
Prefton, in this county, in the month of July 1 124, where they eleded him their 
abbot.* They refted in that fituation for three years; and in the fame month, 
A. D.
1 127, the abbey of Furnefs being founded, they removed to this new fta- 
tion.
When they emigrated, they were of the order of Savigny, and benedidines, 
and fo continued for a confiderable time; their habit was grey: but afterwards 
they became Ciftercians, whofe habit was white.
The monaftery of Savigny was 
little advanced beyond its infancy, when this colony was lent forth ; for it was not 
fenior to Furnefs above 15 years : fo that their eftablilhment had only taken place 
12 years; and the order of Ciftercian monks was not above 14 years date when

the houfe of Savigny was founded.
The monaftery of Furnefs continued bene- 
dieftines for fome time after Savigny had embraced the Ciftercian order ; it was 
not till the time of their fifth abbot, that they followed the example of the parent 
motiaftery, and reformed after the Ciftercian rule : which appears to have been ef- 
fected by fome fecret influence; for their former abbot refufed the reformation, 
and travelled to Rome to plead an exemption for his houfe.
Being interfepted 
by the way, by emifl'aries of Savigny, he was held in durance, and, at length forced 
to that monastery, w'here he was Itript of his abbacy, and by compulfion, had the 
rules of the Ciftercian order impofed on him.
After the deprivation, the vacancy 
was filled up in Furnefs, by the election of Richard de Baioces ; under whom this 
fociety made the change in their order.
It cannot be conceived this deviation 
from the maxims and refolutions made in full chapter, before their former abbot 
departed for Rome, could be brought about without fome powerful means, above 
which corruption the deprived abbot appeared; or, otherwife, we mult neceflarily 
conclude, that the religious fociety permitted their principles and determinations 
to be diflipated like vapours, by the breath of a new ruler.
This change in the 
order of the fociety of Furnefs, f ftrikes us with reflections which draw forth a 
figh for religion.
Let us revert to the words of Weft on this occafion, who, if 
an excufe could have been prelfed forth at an extremity, would, from his parti- 
cular partiality, have given it a birth.
tf The monks of Furnefs, being well fa- 
â€œ tisfied wfith the benediCtine rule, declined the matriculation, and Peter de Ebo- 
â€œ racco their abbot, according to a refolution taken in full chapter, was difpatched 
" to Rome to plead an exemption, and apply for the Popeâ€™s permifllon, that they 
Â«* might live according to the rule which they had at firft embraced, notwith- 
â€œ ftanding the tranfmigration of the Savigny monks.â€ Now let us fee the caufe 
of the reformation : â€œ Richard de Baioces, being himfelf a Norman, entered readily 
** into the views of the Savigny monks; and, having once declared his intention 
" of a filiation with Claraval, the monks joined him in compliment to St. Bernardâ€.
It feems feems to require no comment.
This order, in its origin, held a ftrieft obfervance of the praEiice of penance t 
afjiduous contemplation , and finding the divine praifes ; it did not admit of the ordi- 
nary relaxations, which are partaken by other orders of religious.
St. Bernard, 
who was himfelf a man of learning, well knew' how far reading was neceflary to im- 
prove the mind, even of a reclufe; he therefore took care to furnifh all his monks 
w ith good libraries ; fuch of them as were beft qualified, were employed in taking 
copies of books in every branch of literature; many of which, beautifully written 
on vellum, and elegantly illuminated, are at this time to be feen in the public re- 
pofitories.
Weft mentions one preferved on Conifhead, being i( a plan of education 
for kings and princes .â€ Its utility is difeovered in its title.
f The drefs of the monks was, a white caffock, with a caul and fcapulary of the fame; 
The choir drefs was a white or grey caffock, with caul and fcapulary of the fame, and a girdle of 
black wool ; over that a mozel or hood, and a rocket, the front part of which defeended to the girdle, 
where it ended in 3 round, and the back part reached down to the middle ol the leg behind.
When thefe monks appeared abroad, they wore a caul, and a full black hood.
Every houfe had fome- 
thir.g peculiar to itfelf.

â€œ The Ciftercian monks ufed neither furs nor linen, and never eat any fiefh, 
** except in time of dangerous ficknefs : they abftained even from eggs, butter, 
â€œ milk, and cheefe, unlefs upon extraordinary occafions, and when given to them 
â€œ in alms.
They had, belonging to them, certain religious lay brethren, whofe 
â€˜j office was to cultivate their lands and attend to their fecular affairs: thefe lived 
â€œat their grainges and farms, and were treated in like manner with the monks, 
â€œ but were never indulged with the ufe of wine.
The monks who attended the 
â€œ choir flept in their habits upon ffravv ; they rofe at midnight, and fpent the reft 
â€œ of the night in finging the divine offices.
After prime and the firft mafs, hav- 
â€œ ing accufed themfelves of their faults in full chapter, the reft of the day was 
â€œ fpent in a variety of fpiritual exercifes, with uninterrupted filence.
From the

court held two days journey diftant from their monaftery.
Their houfes could 
only be vifited by their refpeftive abbots.
Their benefadtors, friends, and fer- 
vants, were exempted from all excommunications.^ 
The foundation charter of this houfe, in the year 1126, was to the following 
purport : â€œ In the name of the bleffed Trinity, and in honour of St. Mary of Fur- 
â€œ nefs, I Stephen, Earl of Bologne and Moreton, confulting God, &c.
in the

VVe only viewed Peel Castle at a diftance ; the paftage not being very agree- 
able ; and we happened to be in fight of it, at or near high-water, it is a gloomy 
fortrefs without any ornament, the bulwark of the monaftery, and chief place of 
.defence againft an enemy, to which all the valuables and ornaments of the abbey 
were removed in times of invalion and public danger.
It has a noble and folemn 
appearance, juft emerging from the ocean ; but was a miferable place for a garri- 
fon to be locked up in under a clofe blockade ^ its conftrucftion was adapted to 
thofe rules of warfaring which were pradiifed at the time of its erection, when the 
chief mode of aftaulr, was by ftorm and efcalade ; but againft ordnance it would 
abide no Ihock.
It is remarkable that Weft, who in his elaborate work, has en- 
numerated the articles of greatnefs, power, and authority vefted in the Abbot of 
Furnefs, has taken no notice of this caftle, which was built by the Abbot of Fur- 
nefs, (ft King Edward III.* 
We pafled within fight of Gleafton caftle, which is thus mentioned by Camden 
and his editor.
â€œ It has been very large and firm, having four ftrong towers of 
â€œ a great height, befides many other buildings, with very thick walls.
This was 
â€œ the ancient eftate of the family of Harringtons, to whom it came from the 
â€œ Flemings by the Cancefields ; and whefe inheritance went by a daughter to 
â€œ William Bonvill, and by him at laft to the Greyâ€™s Marquiftes of Dorfet.â€ The 
conftrudtion of this caftle was lingular, being compofed of timber and mortar, 
pointed and plaiftered outwardly wdth lime; and this more remarkable, as it is 
fo near Dalton ; one is led to conceive from thefe circumftances, that Gleafton 
Cafile was of more diftant antiquity, than the abbey of Furnefs: at leaft there is 
no apparent reafon, why it fhould have been conftruCled of fuch materials, if ftone 
was ufed fe generally in its neighbourhood.
Â£ 
* The natural curiofities mentioned by Mr. Weft, are as follows: â€” â€œ The Leven frequently changes 
â€œ its courfe by the drifting of the fands, and the weight of the freftres, and making fer itfelf a deep chan- 
â€œ nel, in fome places difeovers ftratum, fuper ftratum of marie and foil, laced with fibres of vegetables.
â€œ A fpecies cf Bclemnites, reprefenting Shrimps without heads, and other teftacious concretions, to- 
â€œ gether with the Ammonite of St. Hylda, arealfo found in Furnefs.
In the ifland of Fulney, are great 
â€œ quantities of ftones, fo perforated, as to be almoft as light as fcork wood.
â€œ The Tophacea Abba of Pliny, is found near Dalton.
There is abundance of litneftone, and marine 
(hells, in many places.
The Lucargillon and Capnumargos have been difeovered in the parifh of Alding- 
â€œ ham, in great quantities.
Many trunks of very large trees, lay in the bed of the river Leven in different 
â€œ dire&ions, as high up as the tide could force them.â€ Many are cut out in the peat modes.
J To the light you have a view of the ruins of Gleafton-Gaflle, the feat of the Flemings foon after 
the conqueft; and by a fucceflion of marriages, it went to Cancefield, then to Harrington, who enjoyed 
it fix defeents; after that to Bonville, and laftly to Gray, and was forfeited by Henry Gray, Duke of 
Suffolk, A.

four of the moft fubfiantial inhabitants, who were to be approved by the Bifhop 
of Chefter, for the time being.
In 1772 it was certified, that an alms houfe was

Parkeâ€™s money, which then brought a revenue of 24!.

Whicham.
A vein of peat-mofs, containing, in fome places near one fifth of the

In 
* The Angularity of the character of Richard Nicholfon, will it is hoped, apologize for the placing of 
fome account of his life here.
In 1791, he was 77 years of age : was a natural child, born near Mul- 
cader houfe, and like many others in that unhappy date, was left to depend folely on his own indudry 
forfuppoit &c.
At the age of twenty-one, there was fcarce a man in the county, who duril contend 
with him at the ordinary rural diverfions, of running, leaping, wreltling, and playing at foot-ball.
About 
the age of twenty-five, he engaged to enter into the marriage Hate, with a young woman of his neigh- 
bourhood, who proved unfaithful.
His pafiion for her was fo powerful, as to induce him to make a vow, 
that he would never afterwards go to church or market.
In his twenty-fixth year, he became a fervant, 
or rather (liepherd, in this pariih, and lived many years with the late Edmund Gibfon, Efq. and after- 
wards with Mr. Parke.
He not only proved himfelf, during thofe fervices, a Ikilful (liepherd, but gave 
uncommon teftimonies of fidelity and honedy in his dation.
Richard has occafionally ferved other farmers, 
and yeomen, and during the whole fucceffion of fifty years, has literally kept his vow ; has been fo far 
from frequenting the church, than when a (heep, at any time, was caught in briars in the church-yard , 
(which (lands in Mr. Parkes eftate) he hired fome neighbour to fetch it out : he has been equally as te- 
nacious of the other part of his vow.
A pair of leather (hoes being prepared againd his intended marriage, he thenceforth totally denied him- 
felf the ufe of fuch; and (though his bufinefs has been, chiefly twice a-day, to mount the lofty and craggy 
tops of the Elack Combe) has ever fince dragged about a pair of huge clogs (wooden (hoes) fluid with 
iron, nearly two pounds weight a-piece.
His hat tied clofe over his ears, is not permitted to be taken 
off, nnlefs, perhaps, fometimes in private.
His beard has never been (haved fince his twenty-fixth year; 
but when it grows to an inconvenient length, is (hortened with his (beep (heers.
He was conftantly poflc(Ted of a cow, a few (heep, a dog, a cat, and a parcel of hens, all which were 
maintained as his wages, by the perfon whomfoever he ferved; and as there are a few uninhabited cottages 
in the panfli, he was always in poflefiion of fuch of them, as his capricious humour inclined him to inhabit.
Milk and bread form bis principal diet; the former of which lie takes from his cow, as the equal repait 
of his dog, his cat, and himfelf: the benevolent wife of fome cottager, bakes his bread and wa(hes his 
(hiit.
At Chriftinas he always has a (heep killed to make fweet pies, part of which he fuperllitioufly 
keeps till candlemas.
As he was difappointed of a partner in life, fo he refufes the ufe of a bed, lying 
conftantly upon draw.
As the hand of time now prefles heavily upon him, he fubmits to take relief from the parifh, and pof- 
feiTes one of the appointments to the hofpital, which enables him to retain his cow, his dog, his cat, and 
his hens.
He continues, however, to deep in a neighbouring cot, to which he has long been accuftomed 
and where, mod probably, he will end bis days.
Notwithdanding thefe Angularities, perhaps, there is 
no illiterate perfon to be met with, more honed, more faithful, orpoffefled of greater gratitude.
To the 
people who have contributed towards his fupport, he yet will render any fervice in his power: both in 
his partialities and enmities he is extremely warm, fo that there are only fome houfes into which he will 
enter, which he does with Angular ceremony, by previoufiy turning round, and putting the right foot 
firft within the threfhold.

PARISH OF WHITBECK.
In this parifh arc many curiofities worthy of the travellerâ€™s attention.
There 
is a cavity on the mountain Black Combe, which appears to be an entire and ca- 
pacious crater of a volcano; out of a lower corner flows a rivulet into Whic- 
ham, which fprings from the center of the crater ; the depth and diameter of the 
cavity is feveral hundred yards ; the fragments on the margin, are of vitrified 
matter, with fome chryflalizations.
There is a fimilar crater or cavity, at a place 
called the Old Man , at the head of Coniflon Water in Lancafhire, and another at 
Helvellyn near Kefwick in this county ; but thefe differ fo far, that they have each 
a lake at the mouth of the cavities.
Upon the fea fhore, near the centre of the parifh, is a medicinal fpring; when 
the family of Parkes lived at Whitbeck, it was much frequented, and was held to 
be a fovereign remedy for the feurvy and gravel.
In the peat earth and morafs, are found trunks of trees, both oak and fir, of a 
great fize: a few years ago an entire tree, with its roots, &c.
was dug up, feven 
or eight yards in length, and above two feet in diameter, fo found that it was fawn 
into planks for ufe.
Nuts and acrons are frequently found at a great depth.
In the efiate of R.
Gibfon, Efq. at Barfield is a lake or tarn, about 600 yards 
in circumference, where a boat is kept for the pleafure of the neighbouring gen- 
tlemen on fifhing parties; the lake abounds in bafs and trout.
Here, and in the 
ad joining morafles, is much of that inflammable air, which forms the lucid vapour, 
vulgarly called iVill with the JVtfp , frequently feen in the fummer evenings.
On the well; fide of Black Combe, is a fine calcade.
About a quarter of a mile, 
on the rifing ground above the church, is a flate quarry.
This mine has been 
little fearchtd into ; if the quality of the flate in the under feams fliould prove 
good, the working of the quarry would not only be of great fervice in the adjacent 
country, but it is iituated fo near the fea, that it might become a valuable export.
A little below the low water mark, near Guttei by-bay is a very large rock, called 
Blacklegs , in calm weather vilible from the fhore: many veflels have been w'recked 
there from the lailors ignorance of its fituation, as it has not been marked in any 
chart: it fliould be pointed out by fome boom or other diflinguifhing object, to 
preferve thofe who are unfortunately driven too near the fhore.
The fea has gained upon the land in many places in this parifii, and old roads 
and hedges are vifible a confiderabe way beyond water mark.
When the wind blows from the eaft over Black Combe, the inhabitants of the 
During life lie has been remarkably hardy, after being wet, he dries his cloaths upon his back, and yet, 
from cuftom and a good conllitution, takes no harm ; though growing lame, and overtaken by old age, 
yet his native intrepidity remains, and he is yet audacious enough to meet a goring bull in the open field, 
in which bravado he always took an indifereet pride.
As he has had little education, his ideas, of courfe, are confined; but upon any fubjeft, within the 
fphere of his obfervation, his argument is ftrong and rational.
He interefts himfelf about nothing fo 
much, as the fubjeft of courting ; when he is informed that any perfon to whom he wifhes well, has got 
a fweetheart, his firft bufinefs is to acquaint himfelf with the merits or demerits of the parties, after which 
he endeavours, as much as poffible, to impede or promote the match accordingly, by his importunate ex- 
hortation or diffuafion.
Though a non-attendance at church be the chief error that his well-wifhing 
neighbours lay to his charge, yet he has frequently been overheard repeating portions of the church liturgy,

In a field belonging to MY.
W. Pearfon, near Gutrerby, is a monument, com- 
pofed of 30 ftones, called Kirkjlones.
They form parts of two circles, an interior

The interior range 
has two (ides, very entire, oppofite to each other.
The Hones are larger, and the 
circles have been more extenfive, than thofe before defcribed, lying in this parifh.
About 200 yards fouth of the laft mentioned monument, in the middle of a 
ploughed field, is a large cairn of ftones, about 15 yards in diameter, furrounded

Mr. Gough, in his additions to Camden, fays, â€œ At Swinefhcad, near a very high hill, between 
â€œ Bowfell in this county, and Broughton 'in Furnefs, in Lancaflrire, four miles from the latter, is a 
41 druidical temple, which the country people call Sunkenkirk, i.
e. a church funk into the earth.
It is 
â€œ nearly a circle of very large flones, pretty entire, only a few fallen upon floping ground in a fwampy 
41 meadow.
No fituation could be more agreeable to the diuids than this; the mountains almoft incircle 
â€œ it, not a tree is to be feen in the neighbourhood, nor a houfe, except a fhepherdâ€™s cot at the foot of a 
â€œ mountain, furrounded by a few barren paftures At the entrance there are four large ftones, two 
* l placed on each fide at the diftance of fix feet.
The largeft on the left hand fide, is five feet fix inches 
â€œ in height, and ten feet in circumference.
Through this you enter into a circular area 29 yards 
Â« by 30.
This entrance is nearly fouth-eaft.
On the north or right hand fide, is a huge ftone, of a 
â€œ conical form, in height near nine feet.
Oppofite the entrance is another large ftone, which has once 
â€œ been ereft, but is now fallen within the area; its length is eight feet.
To the left hand, to the fouth- 
11 weft, is one, in height feven feet, in circumference eleven feet nine inches.
The altar probably flood 
n in the middle, as there are fome ftones ftill to be feen, though funk deep in the earth.
The circle is 
â€œ nearly complete, except on the weftern fide fome ftones are wanting.
The largeft ftones are about 
* e 3 t or 32 in number.
The outward part of the circle, upon the Hoping ground, is furrounded with 
â€œ a buttrefs, or rude pavement of fmaller ftones, railed about half a yard from the furface of the earth.
44 The fituation and afpeft of the druidical temple, near Kefwiek, is in every refpedt fimilar to this, ex- 
â€œ cept the rectangular recefs, formed by ten large ftones, which is peculiar to that at Kefwrck; but upon 
â€œ the whole, I think a preference will be given to this at Swineftiead, as the ftones in general appear 
44 much larger, and the circle more entire.
â€œ This monument of antiquity, when viewed within the circle, ftrikes you with aftonifhment, how the 
â€œ malfy ftones could be placed in fuch regular order, either by human ftrength or mechanical power.â€ 
Mr. Houfman viewed thefe remains very lately, and deferibes the monument at Sunkenkirk, â€œ to be 
Â« 87 feet by 84 in diameter; that it is ikujted about a mile eaft from the height of Black Combe; that 
â€œ it is feated in the level part of a wet meadow, near a fequeftered farm houfe, furrounded by mountains 
*Â« of a dreary afpedf.
It is compofed of fifty pretty large ftones, and an infinite number of fmall ones, 
** thrown about the bafes of the otheis, now almoft entirely covered with grafs and mofs.
Some of the 
<Â« large ftones are above eight feet above the furface, and are eleven feet in circumference.
The open-

An opening towards the fouth- vveH, affords a view of the

of the governors of Kingâ€™s College, in New Yok, eroded the Atlantic, and was made prefident of that 
refpeffable feminary of learning.
In this dation he continued many years, much to the advantage of the 
indituticn, and much to his own credit.
At length, on the breaking out of the late troubles on that 
continent, taking an attive part on the dde of government, he, with every other loyalijl of any note , ex- 
perienced the moft unrelenting perfections, it was not without extreme hazard, that he preferved his life.
He had barely time, on the kind notice of a friend, half dreffed, and without being able to fave a fingle 
article of bis property, to make his efcape to a boat, which was waiting for him, and took him to one of 
the kingâ€™s fhips then lying off the harbour, before an armed banditti forced their way into his chamber ; 
where, in the dark, fuppodng him to be dill in bed, it appeared in the morning that the bed cloaths had 
been pierced through and through with bayonets.
On his return to England, he obtained a penfion ; and foon afterwards was made chaplain of a man of 
war, commanded by Sir Andrew Snape Hammond.
Having, whild at Queenâ€™s, become intimate with the 
late Bifhop of Durham brother to Lord Thurlow, he, through his intered, obtained a crown living, 
fird in Shropfhire, and afterwards in Gloucederfhire.
Ere long he was prefented by his college to the 
valuable living of Sullhamfead , in Berkfhire ; and at the fame time, was the principal minider in the 
Englillr epifcopal chapel at Edinburgh ; where be redded till 1786, when, apparently in the full enjoy, 
ment of health and early in life, he fuddenly dropped down and died in an apopledlic fit.
He was of a chearful and facetious temper, and poffeffed fuch pleafing and convivial talents, as procured 
him many friends; but it ufed to be remarked of him as a fingularity, that though he condantly attempted 
puns, he feldom made a very good one, but dill fcldomer a very bad one.

form ; on each fquare, or face, are two fhields, raifed from the plane, bearing 
characters in the old Englilli letter, in fome parts mixed with the Saxon.
The emblematical anchor in the third fhield is rather lingular, as it Hands for 
the word falvaior.
The letters R.
B. in the two firlt fhields, denote the bene- 
factor w ho gave the font, or the ftone cutter who executed the work.
The cha- 
racters in the fourth fhield, we are not able to decypher.

PARISH OF BOOTLE.
561 
Monk Force, another manor within this parifh, was given by William de 
Mefchines, to Furnefs Abbey.
On the diflolution of that houfe, it was granted to 
the Huddleftons of Milium, who fold it out.
It is now the property of Edmund 
Gibfon, Efq. The feat- houfe makes a very pretty appearance ; great pains having 
been taken to improve the adjacent lands.
In this parifh is another manor, now united w ith Milium, called Scoggariar, 
laying upon the fea lliore ; of which there is nothing remarkable.
A little from Bootle, to the weft, is a fmall inlet of the fea, called Selkers Bay, 
where the neighbouring people fay, at about a mile diftant from the fhore, in 
calm weather, they can perceive the remains of feveral vefiels, or gallies,Â£ which 
tradition fays, and not improbably, were funk and left there, on fome great invafion 
of the northern parts of this ifland, by the Romans ; and to corroborate this ac- 
count, there are ft ill to be feen, the remains of an encampment on the adjoining 
common, called Efk-meals, where Roman coins have frequently been found, and 
fome broken altars, with imperfect inferiptions.
Several of the coins are faid to 
be in Lord Muncafterâ€™s collection.
From Milium to Bootle, the country through w hich we paffed is, in general, 
barren, meagre, and ill cultivated.
Little hard corn is produced in this tract ; 
the paftures and meadows are very poor, and the cattle and fheep fmall.
The 
mountains, which ftiut in the profpect to the eaft, are black, rugged, and barren ; 
around whole fkirts, a few mean cottages are fcattered.
The land, towards the 
fea fhore, ts full of fens and marfhes.
The fea is in view, the greateft part of this 
way; the Ille of Mann is very diftinctly to be difeovered ; and near Bootle, you 
have a fight of the cliffs of St. Beefhead, and the high lands which cover White- 
haven,

It is remat kable, that thefe little boats, now called Coracles, made exa&ly as Caefar and Pliny here de- 
feribe them, are llill in frequent ufe both in Ireland and Wales, where we ourfelves have feen them.
â€œ Thefe Coracles are generally five feet and a half long, and four feet broad ; their bottom is a little 
â€œ rounded, and their fiiape is exactly oval.
They are ribbed with light laths or fplit twigs, in the man- 
â€œ ner of bafket-work ; and are covered with a raw hide, or ftrong canvafs, pitched in fuch a manner, as 
â€œ to prevent leaking.
A feat croffes juft above the centre, towards the broad end.
The men paddle 
â€œ them with one hand, and filli with the other; and when their work is finilhed, bring their boats home

THE PARISH OF CORNEY, 
(IN ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT.) 
L IES to the eaft, confiding of one manor only, containing about 36 tenements.
â€œ The manor of Corney lies next Butle, in Milium, more toward the north- 
â€œ eaft under the Mountains, upon the top of lefier hills.
Corney is called alfo 
Â« Cornbaw , and Cornho.
Of this place, the pofterity of Michael le Falconer and 
â€œ himfelf, took the furname of Corney, for they had a feofment thereof anciently, 
Â« in the time of King John, and King Henry III.â€* By marriage of the heirefs 
with one of the family of Penningtons, this eftate was united with their large 
pofleffions, together with the patronage of the advowfon.
The mancfr-houfe was at Middleton place, a fmall hamlet, where the court was 
anciently, and ft ill is held : the manfion is gone to decay.
A family of Middle- 
tons were refident here, and took their name from hence.
On an eftate belonging to Mr. William Singleton, to the north of Corney, are 
ruins of a confiderable magnitude, called by the country people, Barnfcar 3 or 
Bardjkew , in the maps, Barnfea: there is no tradition that gives us any light what 
this place was, or to whom it originally belonged; by the great number of drui- 
dical remains in that neighbourhood, it may be reafonably conjeiftured, that this 
was the place of fome of the ancient bards : but how far names fu'ojecft to corrup- 
tion, by length of time, and changes of people and languages, are to guide 
conje&ures like thefe, is fubmitted to the reader, f The form of the ruins, or any 
thing found therein, do not ferve to fupport the notion of fuch diftant antiquity.
The church is reilorial,^ and is dedicated to St, John Baptift.
It belonged to 
the Abbey of St. Maryâ€™s, York, and that religious fociety prefented to it, in the 
year 1536.

THE PARISH OF WYBERTH WAITE, 
(IN ALLERDALE WARD ABOVE DERWENT.) 
A Name derived from the plain or valley of Wybergh.
Our paflage from 
Bootle, was, in a great part, over a rabbit warren, clofe to the fea fhore, 
called Ejktneals, w hich comprehends the whole of the demefne of the manor of 
Wybergthwaite ; the remaining part of our road led along a plain, fandy, and ill 
fenced ; the eaftern mountains, at a little diftance, black and barren.
In this parifh there is only one manor, which gave name to the refident family.
The tenure is cuftomary, under arbitrary fines, rendering heriots and boon fervi- 
ces.
One of the Wyberghs married a daughter, or lifter, of Arthur Boyvill, the 
third Lord of Milium, fon of Godard Dapifer, with whom the faid Arthur gave 
this manor in frank marriage.
It is fevered from Muncaftcr demefne, by the 
river Efk, and is now part of the pofteflions of Lord Muncafter.
The church is re<ftorial,Â£ and is dedicated to St. John.

Extent.] From eaft to weft, three miles ; from north to fouth about two miles.
Soil and Produce.] The foil, towards the fea, is a moift clay ; more eafterly, a kind of hazel 
mould : a confiderable quantity of oats and barley produced ; wheat is little ufed, the farmers backward 
in fowing it, on account of the climate, though the foil feems very fit for it.
Rents.] Near as high as in Bootle.
Sheep.
&c.] The ufual ftock is about 2000.
No river, no coal, freeftone, or lime, and only one road 
of confequence, which leads into Lancafhire.
Remarkable Things.] Leaton-hall, now in ruins, belongs to Lord Muncafter, faid to be formerly 
a religious houfe : heie a banditti cf fmugglers took up their refidence, and continued their illicit trade 
for feveral years, till they were overawed and broken by the coming of the military.
They then applied 
themfelves to agriculture, and their farm fiourifhed in a fingular manner, fupeiior to that of their neigh- 
bours, attributed to their better /kill and knowledge brought from other parts.
Wood,] Almoft deftitute of wood, except fome few plots of underwood and thicket.
The ground 
inclines towards the fea, except on the north-weft, where it is pretty level.
Air.] This parifh is not remarkable for a falubrious air, but is rather thought to he the contrary, per- 
haps from prejudice, derived from accident.
An epidemical fever has prevailed here of late years, which 
has proved fatal to many, ever, to two or three of a family, and that at diftant periods of time.
The 
contagion may, in fome manner, be attributed to negligence, and flovinglinefe, for it is fuppofed to con- 
tinue in the beds, as different fervants coming to live in a houfe where others have bad the diforder, have 
taken the diftemper and died â€” Dr. Jofhua Dixon, of Whitehaven, has taken abundant pains on this 
occafion ; and, it is prefumed, the infe&ion is entirely deftroyed.

Extent.] From eaft to weft, about three miles ; from north to fouth, two miles.
Soil and Produce ] The weftern part of this parifh lies low, is level, and the foil is loamy.
It is 
efteemed the moil fertile, and produces the greateft quantity of grain of any land in this neighbourhood; 
confequently the farms let for the higheft rent.
The fields, in general, are regular, pretty well hedged, 
and have a pleafant appearance.
The eaftern parts are high, barren, and rocky.
Minerals.] No freeftone, lime, or coal.
Rivers.] The Efk bounds this parifh to the north, over which there is no bridge; Lord Muncafter 
intends to build one near to his houfe ; at prefent, the tides render crofting the ford here very uncertain 
and dangerous.
Stainton is a fmall townfhip adjoining to the eaftern part of this parifh ; it is extraparochial, and joins 
with Milium in maintaining the poor.
The proprietors of Stainton keep about 600 ftreep on the eaftern

Though Ravenglafs (lands on the very brink of the fea banks, having the ad- 
vantage of a creek for fmall craft, it is fo ficuated as to enjoy little cr no trade.
The adjacent country furnilhes nothing for export.
It is famous for the beft oyfters 
on the coaft, and the attention to their beds is the chief employment of the inhabi- 
tants ; fome few fmall veftels come up from Whitehaven and Furnefs for oyfters, and

Part of the country we pafted through to Ra-

The editor of Camden f fpeaks of Ravenglafs in the following terms: â€œ The 
* c fhore, wheeling to the north, comes to Ravenglafs, a harbour for (hips, and 
Â« c commodioufly furrounded with two rivers; where, as I am told, there have 
Â«* been found Roman inferiptions.

Â«* thefe rivers (Efk) lifes at the foot of Hardknor, a fteep ragged mountain ; on 
Â« the top of which, were lately dug huge ftones; and the foundation of a caftle; 
Â«* which is very ftrange, conftdering the mountain is fo deep, that one can hardly 
â€œ get up it.
Thefe ftones are poffibly the ruins of fome church, or chapel, which 
Â«* was built upon the mountain.
For Wormius, in his Danifh monuments, gives 
â€œ inftances of the like in Denmark ; and it was thought an extraordinary piece 
Â«Â« of devotion, upon the plancing of Chriftianity in thefe parts, to ered erodes, 
** and build chapels in the moft eminent places, as being both nearer heaven and 
more confpicuous : they were commonly dedicated to St. Michael.

The ext rads from Camden lead us, in the firft inftance, to fpeak of the remains 
on Hardknot mountain ; 
of which we have given 
an exadt plan communi- 
cated to us by Mr. H.
Serjeant of Whitehaven, 
who informs us that he 
and another gentleman 
took it in the furnmer of 
the year 1792.
They de- 
feribe it to us, as being 
fituated on the weft fide 
of Hardknot-hill, about 
120 yards to the left of 
the road leading towards 
Kendal; and has evident- 
ly been intended as a for- 
trefs, for the defence of 
that pafs over the moun- 
tains.
It is, as will ap- 
pear by the plan, as near- 
ly fquare as the ground 
would admit ; the ftdes 
Scale of Feet j | I r } | | being 352, 348, 347, and 
323 feet refpeeftively.
The irregularity of the pofttion of the gates, or entrances, is 
in like manner owâ€™ing to the inequality of the ground.
It is built of the common 
Fell-ftone, except the corners, which, according to the report o t the country 
people, among whom it is known by the name of Hardknot Caftle, were of free- 
ftone, but has been all taken away for buildings in the neighbourhood; there 
being no freeftone nearer than Gosforth: but for that circumftance, it is probable, 
the fortrefs would have been ftanding at this day, in a ftate of admirable perfec- 
tion.
In digging, to clear the foundations of the inner buildings, Mr. Serjeant 
fays, they met with a great many fragments of brick, apparently Roman, which 
muft neceflarily have been brought from a conftderable diftance; alfo feveral 
pieces of ftate, and near the entrances fome fmall arching ftones, or pen ftones, of 
freeftone, w ith remains of mortar on them ; (hewing that in all probability, thefe 
entrances, or gateways were arched.
The gateway to the eaft, leads to a piece of 
ground of about two acres, at the diftance of 150 yards, which, by great labour, 
has been cleared of the ftones that encumbered it, ufed perhaps for a parade, and 
military exercife.
On the north lide of that plot, is a forced, or artificial bank of

Irton gave name to the refiding family, whofe pofterity have continued here for 
many generations; their feat-houfe, called Irton-hall, having a good fituation on 
the afcent of a hill, commands a wide profpecft over this part of the country, and 
of the Irifh fea.
The houfe is well fheltered with wood; but the foil of all the 
adjacent country is poor and ill cultivated: the want of indurtry and art add 
greatly to the natural barrennefs of the land ; no efforts being made to rear wood 
and quickfet fences ; and draining is a practice not known.
The mountains to 
the eaft, are lofty and barren, producing little vegetation, but fhort hether.
By 
the banks of the river Irt, there are narrow inclofures of a pretty afpect, and fer- 
tility ; and one would conceive their beauty would teach the landholder, that 
nature called on him, to relieve her from the (fate of negledt in which fhe lies in 
the adjacent grounds, and yield her to the hands of indurtry ; by proving thus, that 
it was not climate, or quality of foil, of which this trad: was fo much deprived, as 
the labour of its inhabitants.
The manor cf Irton comprehends a large demefne, 
and is of cuifomary tenure.

â€œ them of the poor peopie for a trifle, but fell them at a good price.
The muftel 
â€œ pearls are frequently found in other rivers hereabouts; as alfo in Wales and 
â€œ foreign countries.
Sir John Narborough, in his voyage to the Magellanick 
â€œ Straits, A, D.
1670, tells us, he met with many of them there.
Abundance of 
â€œ mulfels, fays he, and many feed-pearls in every muff'd.
And Sir Richard 
â€œ Hawkins, who had been there before him, affirms the fame thing in his Obfer- 
â€œ vations : adding alfo, that the muffels are very good diet.
There was not long 
â€œ lincc.ll a patent granted to fome gentlemen and others, for pearl fifhing in this 
â€œriver; but whether it will turn to any account is uncertain: for they are not 
â€œ very plentiful here: and if they are a valuable commodity, they might be had 
â€œ in abundance, and at no extraordinary charge, from the Straits of Magellan.
** Tacitus, in the Life of Agricola, takes notice, that the Britifn pearls are Jubfufca

â€œ been given in general terms.

To what has already been faid of the camp or fort on Hardknot mountain, and Bardfcar, See.
(See 
page 562.) we have the following remarks from our above ingenious correfpondent.
â€œ Within the manor of Birker, lies Brother il-keld, a fheep-farm of prodigious extent, which formerly 
â€œ belonged to Furnefs Abbey, and at the diffolution was granted to the Stanley family.
In it is Hard- 
â€œ knot ; in the centre of the area of tliat fort, are the remains of tvva buildings, which feem to have 
â€œ been very confiderahle.
At the four gates lie a larger heap of Hones, than at any other part of the.
11 walls, except at the four corners, where, it is evident, were round towers : among!!
the Hones, which 
are chiefly a rough granite, with which the mountain abounds, are many freeftones and fome bricks ; 
Â« the freeHones mull have been brought upwards of fourteen miles through an, almoft, impafiible coun- 
Â« try, and laH up a mountain, at this time, barely pofiible for a light cart to be drawn ; and the bricks.
â€œ could not have been obtained nearer than Drig, the adjacent country affording no materials.
Its 
<1 fftuation is on the fummit of the firff afeent of Hardknot, and commauds the only pafs into Weftmor- 
<< land, and an extenfive view of the fea coaff, and' the Ifle of Mann : 150 yards above the fort is a 
Â«Â« level plot, the work of art.
A road leading to Amblefide, is called the Kingâ€™s Coach road; not 
<Â« many years ago, feveral pieces of leaden pipe were found in a direction to the fort, leading from a 
â€œ* well, called Maddock-how-vvell, about a mile and a half diffant, which indifputably fupplied the fort 
<1 with water.
â€œ It may poflibly not be thought improper to mention another piece of antiquity in this neighbour- 
â€œ hood, though out of the chapelry, the Ruins of the City of Barnscar, which is fituated on a ver- 
dant hill, in the manor of Birkby, at the foot of the lake, called Devoke Water.
Tradition gives 
<Â« this place to the Danes, who, it is faid, gathered for inhabitants, the men of Drig, and the women of

This place is about 300 yards long, from; eaff to weft ; and 100 yards broad* 
Â» from north to fouth ; now walled round, fave at the eaft end, near three feet in height : there appears 
Â«i to have been a long ftreet, with feveral crofs ones: the remains of houfe-fteads, within the walls, are

There is a tradition that the chapel bell, hung in an oak tree, on an eminence 
on the north fide of the chapel ; and this notion is fupported by the name of 
Bell hill ; as there is no other evidence, we are rather inclined to believe, that 
this hill was the place of the Bel-teing , from the many remnants of antiquity, 
which we have before noted.
On a ftone near Buck-Cragg, are the impreffions

Lakes.] Here is an extenfive lake, called Waft-water.
â€” Alfo, at the head of Mitredale, is Burn- 
moor-Tarn, which is about a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth.
â€” On the fouth fide of Waft-water

Remarkable Plants.] Here is an aromatic flirub, called Gale; alfo, on the mountains, grow

Roads and Appearance of the Country.] In this large and unfrequented traft of country, there 
are only two made roads of any extent, the one leading from Ravenglafs by Hardknot into Weltmor- 
land, and the other from Gosforth, &c.
to Kefwick ; a defciiption of the latter, and the country border- 
ing on it, will give the reader a tolerable idea of thefe parts.
This road forms the only communication 
between Kefwick, &c.
and the towns on the weftern coaft, no other road interfering the country for 
near ten miles to the north, and fix to the fouth : from which, one would at firft imagine, this road 
would of courfe be mueh fiequented ; but I found the contrary.
From Kefwick I travelled up Borrowdale, a wild romantic feene, the road rather rugged but paffable 
on horfeback ; reached the black lead mines without much trouble, where, inquiring the road to Waf- 
dale, I was (hewn a mountain, called Stye-head, fomewhat humbler than its neighbours, over which, they 
informed me, the road lay.
I therefore fleered my courfe towards it, on the dim road I was in, but 
before I had travelled thiee quarters of a mile, I found that a flood which had happened within the lafl 
twelve months, had not only fweept away the road, but alfo the adjacent fences to the left.
It was there- 
fore only here and there that I c uld difeover the remains of a path fourteen inches broad (which I found 
v/as^the mean breadth for five miles) my dirt ft ion was, by keeping my eye on the point of land to which 
1 was pointed; but when I came to the bafe of the hill, I lofl the lafl veftiges of a road.
Thus fituated, 
I determined to fcramble up the mountain at random; and before I reached the fummit, had the pleafure of 
once more difeovering the path, which had a ferpentine direftion, and was formed by removing the large 
{tones and hillocks.
A little to the right, I obferved feveral waterfalls, of valt height, occafioned by a 
brook which tumbled from the precipices.
Arriving at the top of the mountain, I expefted to find an 
opening towards the wed, but I found my view (hut up by other mountains.
I purfued the dim traft, 
with Donaldâ€™s map in my hand (to whom, I muft do the juflice to obferve, that he has laid down the 
roads, rivers, brooks, &c.
with great truth and minutenefs.) After walking about half a mile, (for this 
was not a pafs to venture my horfe in) I came to a refervoir, or fmall lake, called Stye- head-water, out 
of which flows one of the principal branches of the Derwent.
Going a little further, I found another 
fmall brook running the contrary way into Wafl-wa:er.
At length I arrived at an opening, where I had, 
as it were, a view into another region : IVafdale-head appeared a long ftripe of level, inclofed land, with 
fmall irregular fields and cottages interfperfed; and as it feemed feated below the general level of the 
earth.
I proceeded down the mountain, confiding partly of rock, and partly of loofe flones, the paffage 
exceeding difficult.
Here tire fells bear a very different afpeft from thofe of Borrowdale, they -are much 
higher, and in many parts deftitute, even of a (hrub, their crowns being naked rocks, and their Tides 
covered with flones and gravel, in a regular (lope, which, by running down in different drips of colours, 
gives them at a diflance, the appearance of folar rays .
Two very' high hills, before I reached Wafdale- 
head, between which the road leads, and wh.ffe bafes nearly meet, have a very awful appearance ; their 
crowns confifl of broken cliffs of a conical form, and they incline confiderably towards each other, as if 
they would fome time come together.
Wafdale head is a narrow dale, the inelofures fmall and irregular, but level, divided with (lone walls ; 
the village chiefly inhabited by (hepheids; upon the whole, this feene is exceedinglv wild and fequeflered, 
but to the contemplative perfon, who is a lover of romantic view, thefe places have a thoufand beauties.
Below Wafdale head, the road lies along the north fide of Wad-water, well gravelled.
The inhabitants of thefe diflant dales are blunt, fimple, and honed; neither fcience nor fraud have 
yet got much footing there ; fo that innocence and happinefs may be prefumed to prevail : but alas !
is 
it not to be feared, that the paffions of envy', hatred, and malice, io natural to man, in his primeval, and 
mod uncultivated date, may not, in a great meafure, dilturb thofe blefiings!
philofophy is certainly ne- 
ceffury to allay the pafiions, and give the mind a noble firmnefs, a calmnefs aodierenity, which cannot be 
fbaken by human viciffitudes.

If the profpe<fi of fiupendous cliffs and mountains, and of headlong waterfalls, 
delight the travellerâ€™s eye, Wafdale-head is entirely furrounded by fuch obje&s, 
except a narrow outlec on the fouth-weft fide, which opens a fcene no lefs finking 
in its alpine beauties.
Where the water defcends from this dale, it forms the 
head of the lake, called Wafwater, faid to be three miles in length, and three 
quarters of a mile in breadth, in the widefi part, and never to have ice upon it.
It is bounded on one tide by Nether Wafdale, and on the other fide by a chain of 
black rocks, with fame red veins; they are lofty, and appear perpendicular; from 
thefe veins, ftones and gravel are frequently falling into the lake with a horrid 
noife.
Though the common-right, at Wafdale-head, is very extenfive, affording 
pafturage for large flocks of fheep, yet the valley is thinly inhabited, and very 
confined, containing, as it is computed, little more than a mile in length.
The 
village contains eight families, three of land owners, four farmers, and one la- 
bourer, in all 47 inhabitants ; there is no mill, public-houfe, fhop, or tradefman, 
in the valley, notwirhftanding it is a confiderable difiance from any market-town.
The vefiiges of many ruined cottages, fhew that this village was once more con- 
fidcrablc.
A road over the mountains is now forming through the village, to 
lead between Kefvvick and Egremont, and in time may make fome improvement, 
though it is difiant 15 or 16 miles from either of thofe market-towns.
One of 
the land owners, whofe name is Fletcher, derives the family poflefiions here, from 
a courfe of not lefs than 700 years.
Wafdale chapel has not yet the rights of 
burial : the incumbentâ€™s income, is about 20I.
a-year, arifing from lands obtained 
entirely from Queen Anneâ€™s bounty.
The owners of the tenements make a lmall 
voluntary addition.
The tithes are the property of Mr. Stanley.
Of Nether Wafdale no further particulars are necclfary, than what are before 
mentioned.

Extent.] From eaft to weft, feven miles ; from north to fouth, two miles.
Soil and Produce.] The foil confifts chiefly of alight red fand, which affords to the travellerâ€™s eye, 
a remarkable contraft, to the appearance of the more fouthern parifhes.
The produce is chiefly oats, and 
a little barley ; but the proprietors, in general, feem negligent, as the foil is certainly capable of being 
employed to greater advantage by proper culture.
Would the occupiers fovv turnips, (to which the 
ground feems peculiarly adapted) and drefs them well ; and the next year fow it with barley and clover, 
or other artificial grafs feeds ; and fo lay it down for a year or two, and then plow it out again for oats, 
and the next year work it in fallow for turnips, &c.
they would certainly find a very great advantage.
Inftead of which, many of the farmers let their ground run wild, and lay it down in that ftate.
I ob- 
ferved feveral fields, where the furze (called whins in the provincial dialed!) with which the fences are, 
in general, bearded or planted, had been suffered to fpread their feed, and run all over the inclofure.
Quarries.] Abundance of Freeftone, but no limeftone or coal.
Sheep.] Upon the high commons to the eaft end of the parifti, about 2000 ftteep are kept, which, 
with the other cattle, are of the fame quality with thofe of the neighbouring parifties.

â€”No river, the parifti is watered by fome fmall brooks.
General Appearance.] This parifti is fituated rather high, but is not mountainous, though une*

The 
faid George Edward, was high fneriff of the county of Cumberland, anno 1774.
This name is written in ancient writings and evidences, Stanleigh, Stanlowe.
and Stanley.
By this genealogical account, it appears that there have been twenty-three ge- 
nerations in feven hundred and fixty fix years, and that the property of this part 
of the family, who fixed in Cumberland, has defeended regularly from father to 
fon to the prefent poffeffor (except that part of it which was in Grefwirhen, Em- 
bleton, and Brackenthwaite, and which went out of the family with Mary Stanley, 
who married Sir Edward Herbert, afterwards Earl of Povvis, fon to the Earl of 
Pembroke) for four hundred and forty-nine years.

The parifh of Ponfonby, is bounded on the eafl and noith by St. Bridgetâ€™s, 
(Beckermont) the river Calder dividing the parifhes ; and on the fouth and weft 
by Gosforth, fo that it lies between, and is entirely furrounded by thofe two 
parifhes.
It is at the diftance of four miles from Egremont, which is a good market- 
town ; and alfo, only nine miles from Whitehaven ; of courfe the farmers are well 
fituated for difpofing of the produce of their lands : they are alfo at an eafy dif- 
tance, both from lime and coal : for the former of which articles, they pay eight, 
fi Sir William Stanley of Hooton, Bart, being dead this prefent year 1794* unmarried, by which that 
branch is extinguifhed ; the Stanleys of Cumberland, the Earl of Deiby, and Sir John Stanley of 
Alderney, are the only three leading branches of the family, and all fprung from William de Stanleigh, 
Lord of Stanleigh, in the county of Stafford, who married the daughter of Sir Philip Baumrille, Lord 
of Stourton.

and for the latter, (which is the chief fuel ufed in this parifh) tenpence per bufliel, 
laid down on the fpot.
The foil, in general, is a hazel mould ; but near the fea, a drong clay, and pro- 
duces crops of wheat and other grain, inferior to few in the county.
This parifh is greatly improved within thefe twenty years, fince Mr. Stanley 
took up his refidence here, who is, himfelf, very fkilfu!
in agriculture; and gives 
every encouragement to his farmers, to profecute that plan of hulbandry, which 
is mod likely to turn out to their own profit and advantage; by which means his 
rents are not only well and exadfly paid, but he has the fatisfadion of feeing his 
grounds in a high and improved Hate of cultivation, and his farmers in a happy 
and flourifhing condition, feveral of whom, the lad year, had from 500 to 1000 
Rooks of wheat each, on ground which, upon Mr. Stanleyâ€™s coming to the cdate, 
was entirely covered with furze and broom.
The foil feems alfo very well adapted for the growth of wood, Mr. Stanley 
having planted, within thefe twelve or fourteen years, upwards of one hundred 
thoufand of different forts of fored trees, all of which thrive well, and are both a 
great ornament to the country, and are alfo likely to be produdive of profit to the 
prefent and future generations.
The air here is particularly plcafant and falubrious, infomuch, that a neigh- 
bouring phyfician, eminent both for his pradice and knowledge, calls this, the 
Montpellier of Cumberland.
It is fituated at a proper didance from the keen 
and (harp winds that blow from the mountains, and from the damp air and incle- 
ment blafts which come from the fea, fo that the inhabitants are healthy and 
vigorous, being alike drangers to the ague, and epidemical fevers.
Ponfonby is divided into two quarters, or conftablewicks, viz.
Ponfonby and 
Calder.
It contained twenty tenements or farms, which were of arbitrary tenure, 
but have been modly, either purchafed or enfranchifed by Mr. Stanley.
There 
are alfo two or three tenements, in Gosforth, belonging' to this manor.
About 12 years ago, George Edward Stanley, Efq. the prefent owner, removed 
the place of his family-refidence to the prefent lituation, where he has built an ele- 
gant and commodious houfe, on a rifing ground, upon the banks of the river Calder.
â€” The houfe, which is 72 feet in front, and j 1 5 feet in depth, is remarkable for 
the elegance and convenience of its apartments ; and commands an extenlive prof- 
pe<ft, both by fea and land.
The Welfh mountains, in a fine day, may be feen 
from it, and the Ifle of Mann being nearly oppofite, is a pidurefque objeeft : it 
alfo commands a view of the beautiful ruins of Calder Abbey, and the elegant feat 
of Jofeph Tiffin Senhoufe, Efq. The gardens and walks on the wmody banks of 
the river Calder, are beautifully romantic.
In the apartments are feveral excel- 
lent portraits, both of the ancient and modern maders.
Among many other pieces 
of antiquity, brought from Dalegarth-hali to Ponfonby, is a mod curious carved 
beddead, made, as iiippofed, in the year 1345.
The arms of the Awdhwaite family, 
quartered w ith the Stanleys, are placed on the head, and round the cornices, and 
the whole is finidied in fo excellent a manner, as to render it one of the greated 
curiofities of the kind in the kingdom.* The

which muft, therefore, moft probably, be full as old.

a vicarage, but afterwards revoked, fo that it remains as a perpetual curacy.

In 1717, Dodlor Cleator gave tool, to the minifter for preaching tw'elve fer- 
mons every year; which money, together with another fum, given by one of Mr.
Stanleyâ€™s anceftors, was laid out in the purchafe of an eftate, called Gill-houfe, in 
the parifli of Gosforth; but the curate being diflatisfied with the intereft, which 
the money fo laid out brought him (lands being then comparatively of little value) 
requefted Mr. Stanley and the church-wardens to fell the eftate, and lend the 
money out at intereft, which was accordingly complied with; but the money 
being lent to a Merchant in Whitehaven, who became a bankrupt, the whole was 
loft, and the income of this church thereby greatly injured; as the eftate in 
Gosforth, at this time is worth 30I.

Not only the manor of Ponfonby, but mod of the eflates within the parifh, are 
now in the pofTefiion of Mr. Stanley, either by inheritance or purchafe.
The poor-

The inhabitants are all of the clfablifhed church, and remarkable for their at- 
tendance at divine worfhip, and for their devout and orderly behaviour.
They 
are focial and chearful, and poflcfs a greater degree of urbanity and hofpitality, 
than is ufually met with : but the example of their fuperiors, conflantly refident 
amongfl them, together with their intercourfe with Whitehaven, and other adja- 
cent places, fo wonderfully improved within this century; and, perhaps, the great 
Lancafhire road, which leads through the middle of the parifh, hath given them an 
intercourfe with ft rangers, have been the means of polifhing the manners of a 
country, which, thirty or forty years ago, was neither fo well cultivated, nor fo 
civilized, as it is at prefent.
The parifh is about four miles in length, and one and a half in breadth ; it 
contains no curiofities, either natural or artificial, fave as before noted ; and, ex-

Extent.] From eaft to weft, upwards of four miles ; from north to fouth, a mile and a half.
Soil and Produce.] The moil prevalent foil, is a kind of reddifh hazel mould, and which is fertile.
â€¢â€”A little wheat, barley, turnips, and potatoes are grown; but oats, the principal crop, although other 
grain is more fown of late years than formerly.

Rents.] Land lets for about 15s.
an acre upon an average.
Common Lands.] In the eaftern part of the parifh, is a plot of common land, which is ufed by the 
proprietors of the neighbouring farms, and upon which they keep 600 or 700 fheep.

fourteen hands and a half high; and black cattle weigh about nine ftone and a half per quarter.
Fuel.] The eaft, peat ; and coal to the weft.
Game.] Some groufe, partridges and hares in abundance, from the protedlion given by Mr. Stanley.
â€” The lower cla.Tes of people deferting their families to run after game, is a thing which common reafon 
condemns: preventing that error, is a gracious clemency {hewn to the craftfmen and the labourer: how

T HE church of Saint Bride, placed on a lofty fituatiort, Brikes the eye at a 
confidcrable diftance.
â€” In this parifli are the remains of 
CALDER ABBEY, 
Diflant from the road, about a mile, and fituated on the northern banks of the 
river Calder, in a narrow valley, inclofed with fine hanging woods, but in marfhy 
and ill chofen ground.
The feclufion of the place, and Bill, and folemn retire- 
ment were well adapted to the auflerities and religious rules of the monks of the 
Ciftcrrian order, who were placed here.
â€œ Between Cauder Beck and Beckermit, toward the fea, Bands St. Brides; and

f â€˜ the abbey Bands, and thence into the weBern ocean.
The water had that name 
of the Irifh inhabitants there, taken from the form and nature of the place.
*' The abbey, as 1 have read, was BrB founded in the year of grace, 1134, about 
Â«* the laB year of King Henry I.
when William Duncan was Lord of Egremcnt : 
Â«< howbeit; 1 think it was not perfected, till Thomas de Multon finifhed the works,})

cf gift of William, nephew to David, King of Scots, and where thev remained 
Â« four years, when David making an inroad into thefe parts, Gerold, with his 
" brethren, returned for refuge to tne mother monaftery in Furnefs.
This hap- 
â€œ pened about the 3d of King Stephen, The abbot of Furnefs refufed to receive 
â€œ Gerold and his companions, reproaching them with cowardice, for abandoning 
â€œ their monaftery ; and alledging, that it was rather the love of that eafe and 
â€œ plenty, which they expected in Furnefs, than the devaluation of the Scots army, 
â€œ that forced them from Caldre.
Some writers fay, that the abbot of Furnefs 
â€œ inlifted, that Gerold fhould diveft himfelf of his authority, and abfolve the 
â€œ monks from their obedience to him, as a condition of their receiving any re- 
Â«Â« lief, or being again admitted into their old monaftery: This, Gerold and his 
Â« companions refufed to do; and turning their faces from Furnefs, they, with the 
Â« remains of their broken fortune, which confided of little more than fome cloaths,

Â« guide, went in queft of better hofpitality.

The abbot of Furnefs, underftanding that

fuffering a row of lime trees, which are planted by the road fide to interrupt the 
travellerâ€™s view of thefe fine remains as he defcends from the lodge : for fo very 
unfortunately are they placed, as totally to intercept one of the mod excellent views 
of this kind in the north of England.
Nothing could be more auguft than the 
approach here ; if thofe execrable trees were taken away ; for the advance is on a 
ffraight line to the tower, with the colonade, which formerly formed a confidera- 
ble part of this edifice, on your left hand.
The firft part you come to, is the 
colonade, having five circular arches, fupported on cluttered pillars, in length 27 
paces.
A facia remains above the arches, as it anciently fupported the roof.
The 
tower is fupported by light cluttered pillars, of excellent workmanfhip, about 24 
feet in height, wdth capitals ornamented with a roll, from whence fpring very 
beautiful pointed 1 arches, which formed the cupola, or lanthorn.
This church 
has been but fmall, the width of the choir being only 25 feet; the fquare of the 
tower, 21 feet; and the limb of the crofs, which we could trace, 22 feet wide.
The monattery has adjoined to the church; the upper chambers fhew a row of 
eight windows to the weft, and feven to the eaft.
There are the remains of three 
arches, on one fide, upon the ground floor, which appears to have belonged to a 
fmall cloifter ; the members of the arches are numerous and femicircular.
At 
the end, adjoining to the church, is a large window, w'hich appeared to us to have 
appertained to the chief apartment of the houfe, of the chapter houfe or refectory, 
only the outfide walls are (landing.
As thefe fine remains immediately adjoin to 
the manfion-houfe of J.
T. Senhoufe, Efq. they have been cleaned out, the ground 
levelled and trimmed, and much of the beauties taken away, by bringing it into 
its prefent fmooth order.
It is obfervable, that the columns and arches of the 
tower, are uniform ; but the columns of the colonade, have capitals varioufly or- 
namented : the third, only is decorated with the zigzag, lo frequent in the old 
Sax-on architecture.
Mr. Senhoufeâ€™s manfion is placed in a folemn firuation, 
fhadowed from the fun by the higher walls of the monattery, and furrounded by 
thefe awful ruins.
Jt appears that many eminent perfons have been interred here, from the frag- 
ments of effigies preferved, and now placed againft the w'alls; but no infeription, 
or other evidence remains, fave the devices on the fhidds, to point out to whofe 
tombs thefe fculptures belonged.
One of them is reprefented in a coat of mail v

The demefne is large, but towards the fea, though the land rifes in eafy fvvells, 
and is capable of much improvement, from the great quantity of manure that 
might be obtained from the fea fhore, yet it remains little attended to.
The fpirit of

in general, are unfneltered, and but meanly fenced.
The lands on the border of

north-eaft, rife with lofty, but black and barren brows; they (hew their word

This church, with the church of the adjoining parifh of St. Johnâ€™s

folution, their proper revenues not being reftored, they were left naked, and from 
their retfforial and vicarial origins, were reduced to perpetual cures ; their ancient 
endowments being mixed indifcriminately, with the poffeffions of the Abbey upon 
that occafion : without diflindtion they were granted out with thofe poffeffions.

By this means, thefe two churches, being utterly impoverished, have been fup^ 
plied by one and the fame curate, nominated to both by the fame impropriator 
and patrora, and are now regarded as two parifhes united.
f 
In this parifh, near the mouth of the river, lies Sella Park, the rnanfian of Darcey 
Curwcn, Efq. a fweet retirement, on a fine plain, within a mile of the fea.
It 
was anciently a cell to the abbey of Calder, and had a park Stocked with deer, for 
the ufe of the monaftery.
On the diffolution of chauntries and fmail endowments, 
this was granted by the crown to Sir Henry Curwen, grandfather of the prefent 
owner.
The manor of Great Beckermot, on the river End, in this parifh, belongs to 
Lord Egremont, and has conftantly attended the demefne of the barony.
+ In Bifhop Brighamâ€™s time, they paid fynodals and procurations jointly ; but fince that time, by 
reafon of their poverty, no doubt, they have paid nothing.
The abbot and convent, in their petition to Godefride, Avchbifhop of York, fet forth, â€œ That althoâ€™ 
â€œ they had the right of patronage, in the churches of St. John Baptift, of Beckermet, and St. Michael, 
â€œ in Arlekden; yet, by reafpn of the importunity of great men, and proviiions of the faid benefices, 
â€œ they had r.ot ftee liberty to prefent unto the feme; and therein, where they obliged one great man, they 
â€œ difobliged many more.â€ â€” On their petition, the archbifhop appropriated St. Johnâ€™s to the houfe of 
Calder, for the increafe of their alms, and better fuftentation of the convent: and that the Archdeacon 
of Richmond might not be prejudiced, to whom the right of fequeftration, &c.
belonged, he ordained 
that the church of Ariekden fhould be perpetually annexed to the archdeaconry, fo that he might have 
a houfe in Coupland to which he might refort, when he and his officials â€œ came into thof^ parts, through 
hogs and â€¢woods and various ternpejlsâ€ to difeharge their ecclcfiaftical fun&ion.
The churches were thence* 
forth ferved by the monks of the houfe.
The church of St. Johnâ€™s was certified to the governors of -Queen Anneâ€™s bounty, at yl.
Becker- 
mont, otherwife known by the name of St, Johnâ€™s and St. Bridgetâ€™s.
Extent.] St. Bridgetâ€™s, from eaft to weft, eight miles : from north to fouth, about a mile and a half.
â€” St. John's from eaft to weft, three miles ; from north to fouth, about a mile and a half.
They ate 
feparated for a confiderable way, by the parifh of Hale.
Soil and Produce.] Near to the fea, alight foil; towards ths eaftern mountains the land is cold and 
barren.
â€” The weft and north-weft parts of St. Johnâ€™s, are loamy and fertile, producing good wheat and 
barley : the land in St. Bridgetâ€™s, efpecially near the rivers, is fertile, but barley and oats are the chief 
produce there.
Quarries.] Of freeftone, but no limeftene or coal.
Manufactory.] In St. Johnâ€™s, a fmail manufe&cry of fail cloth.
Rivers and Fish.] The river Calder bounds the fouth part of St. Bridgetâ€™s, and the river End 
borders, both on St. Bridgetâ€™s, and St. Johnâ€™s, but chiefly on the latter ; it feparates hoth parifhes from 
St. Bees.
A t the mouths of thefe rivers, are two fifheries of felmon; that in End belongs to Lord Lonf- 
dale, and that in Calder to Mr. Lutwidge.
Lake.] In St. Bridgetâ€™s, a fmail lake, called S ella- fet d- tarn, in which are bafs and other lake fifh.
Sheep and Cattle.] In St. Bridgetâ€™s are about 2000 fheeep, and in St. Johnâ€™s about joco, which 
are kept upon the high moors, in the eaftern parts.
â€” Black cattle weigh about nine itone and a half rÂ« r 
quarter.
â€” Horfes about 15 hands high.
r 
Rfnts.J Fourteen or fifteen fhillings an acre upon an average.
General Appearance.] The ground of thefe parifhes inclines towards the fea ; the coaft is prettv 
level, and for fome diftance the banks aie not high.
â€” The fields are irregular, and having little wood upon 
them, have in general a naked appearance.
â€” Calder Abbey is in a low, but pleafent valley ; the manfion- 
houfe lately much improved.
â€” A confiderable quantity of oak wood is growing near it upon the banka 
of Calder.
â€” Eafton-hall is a fmail neat building, fituated in a pleafent, though not very fertile vale, in St 
Johnâ€™s.

PARISH OF St. BRIDE.
The adjoining parifh of St. Johnâ€™s, has little worthy notice.
The manor of 
Little Beckermot, has, for fome ages, been the property of the Flemings of Ry- 
dal!, held by them as demefne of the barony of Egremont.
" A little above St. Brides lies the manor of Beckermit, now, and of old time, 
â€œ the Flemings lands of Rydall, who, as mefne lords, between the barons of 
â€œ Egremont ; and the polTeflors, and lands', tenants of Rotington, Frifington, 
â€œ Arlogharen, and Weddikar, did hold them as fees of Beckermit, and it 'elf as a 
â€œ demefne of the baron, as a fee of Egremont barony.
The firft Fleming that 
<c I read of, was Reginal Fleming, W'hofe fon, John was feized of the fame, in 
ct King Edw'ard II.
â€™s time, and his fon Thomas, the fon of John, in Edward Ill.â€™s 
â€œ time.* 
The church Rands on the mouth of the river End,f It was given in the year 
1262, by one of the Flemings, to Calder Abbey, and was foon after appropriated 
thereto.
