My Dear Sir.
You are aware that during the past 
few years a more systematic search throughout Great Britain 
and Ireland has resulted in the discovery of so many varieties 
of Ferns, (departures from the normal form of the parent from 
which they have sprung,) that they now count by hundreds 
instead of units.
"Our Xative Ferns," which, by youi* kind permission, has 
been dedicated to you, has been Avritten for the purpose of 
making these many varieties familiar to the public.
Knowing the interest you take in any endeavour to collect 
facts that may be useful, and that you will excuse the short- 
comings of these volumes, they have been dedicated to you as 
a slight token of my respect and esteem.
Believe me.
My Dear Sir, 
Yours very truly, 
EDWARD JOSEPH LOWE.

INTRODUCTION.
The love of flowers is often gained from some grand floral 
display that accident has brought under our notice, such as 
the London and provincial Horticultural Exhibitions; yet the 
desire to grow similar plants ourselves is but rarely felt under 
these circumstances, and this results from a conviction that we 
cannot equal those specimens of horticultural skill that we 
observe have merited a prize.
The desire to cultivate plants, 
however, is engrafted into us more from seeing plants growing 
in their native wildness, and as gathered together in the 
collections of our principal Nurserymen: indeed both these 
sources help our inclinations forward until we become en- 
thusiastic lovers of Botany.
My first love of Ferns was 
gained by a visit to the Fernery of ^lessrs.
Backhouse, of 
York.
In those days British Ferns were more popular tlian 
the exotic species: subsequent visits, however, to Messrs.
Veitch and RoUisson, convinced me that foreign Ferns were 
floral gems, and created a desire to know more about them.
Stove and greenhouse flowers can only be cultivated in 
hothouses; it is therefore the cultivation of hardy plants that 
must claim the attention of the million.
Who could visit the 
pansy-beds of Mr. Dean, of Bradford, or of Messrs.
Downie, 
Laird, and Laing, for instance, without wishing to grow these 
plants at home.
In alluding to the flowers of our gardens, 
now becoming so deservedly cultivated, the want of a popular 
illustrated work on the subject is to be regretted; a desideratum 
B 
11 INTRODUCTION.
tliat it is hoped will not be of long standing.
The field is 
wide, and as one class of plants occupy the attention of some, 
and another class of others, it seems desirable for the universal 
good of such a woi'k that it should be written in independent 
volumes.
Such a series of books might be comprised thus: — 
"Native Ferns," "Bulbous Plants," "Alpine Plants," "Herba- 
ceous Plants," "Hardy Annuals," and "Florist's Flowers." 
Every one is interested in the history of what he possesses; 
and one reason why our "Native Ferns" are so much admired, 
is that a knowledge of them can be gained from books 
published on the subject.
There is no class of plants more 
lovely than Ferns, yet there are many tribes equally so, and 
indeed the combination of both is extremely desirable.
Nature 
mingles them together in the most exquisite manner, and what 
can we copy equal to nature.
The present work is written more especially to supply a 
pictorial want, to make the amateur acquainted with his 
Native Ferns without the labour of botanical study.
Some 
persons have not the time, whilst others have not the incli- 
nation, to study botany, and yet they possess the desire to 
know the plants they cultivate: to these pictures speak 
volumes.
It is true that the British species have been des- 
cribed by numerous authors, yet new species have gradually 
been discovered; but it is not the species that require publicity 
so much as the varieties of those species; many of them are 
distinct in character, and so various in form, that the Fern 
cultivator must include them amongst his choicest gems.
So 
different .are they from the species themselves, that it is in 
some instances difficult to kno\s^ the parent from which they 
have sprung.
There is so much fascination in the study of Ferns, that no 
one can wonder at the many persons who have either com- 
menced the cultivation of these plants, or have made the 
subject a study, and, not having the opportunities of growing 
INTRODUCTION.
UI 
the Ferns, have contented themselves with making a collection 
of fronds.
For elegance of form, and brilliancy and diversity of colour, 
no plants can vie with the Ferns of the world.
In a small 
island like Great Britain, there is not that difference in climate 
that will enable any but a limited number to grow in the open 
air.
We are thus deprived of the effect that might be 
produced by the gold and silver-powdered Ferns, the climbing 
species, the stately tree Ferns, or the many exquisite parasites, 
and the tribes of Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes.
If England 
has not these gems, she can boast of many very beautifid 
species and varieties, perhaps more sombre in colour, but 
nevertheless quite as distinct and lovely in form.
English Ferns are all comprised in the order Polypodtaceee, 
and consist of the following genera: — 
1. — Polypodium, LinncBUs. Polvpody.

Polypodium — From the Greek polys — mauy, and pous — ^a foot, in 
allusion to the branching of the rhizoma.
Phegopteris — From the 
Greek phegos — a Beech, and pteris — a Fern.
The Beech Fern, although, local, is widely dispersed in 
Great Britain.
It is to be met with in mountainous disti'icts 
ill damp woods and hedge-rows, especially in the neighbourhood 
c

of water: hence its other EngUsh name, "Mountain Polypody." 
Pohjiiodium phegopteris is a most beautiful species, and delights 
to creep with its rhizoma amongst wet moss, rooting into 
decayed vegetable matter.
In England the Beech Fern is to be found in Cheshire, 
Cornwall, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Devonshire, Durham, 
Herefordshire, Lancashire, Northumberland, Shropshire, Staf- 
fordshire, Sussex, Westmoreland, and Yorkshire.
In Scotland 
it is much more generally distributed.
In Ireland the Beech 
Fern is uncommon and very local; it has been found in 
Antrim, Down, Donegal, Kerry, Louth, Londonderry, and 
Wicklow.
In Wales it is common in Brecknockshire, Caer- 
marthenshire, Caernarvonshire, Cardiganshire, Glamorganshire, 
Merionethshire, and Montgomeryshire.
Also a native of the 
Isle of Man and Shetland Islands.
The Beech Fern is not only found throughout Europe from 
Italy to Iceland, but it is widely spread in North America.
It occurs at Kamtschatka and along the Altai Mountains.
This lovely species is easily cultivated in our Ferneries, if 
planted in a moist shady situation in rich vegetable mould, 
and especially when amongst rock-work, and where the 
moisture in the soil is not stagnant.
If water is introduced 
into the Fernery, this plant should be within reach of the 
spray of a waterfall, as it is in the highest degree luxuriant 
when planted under such circumstances.
The form of the frond is ovate-triangular, acuminate, and 
tapering to a point; pinnate below and pinnatifid above.
PinnsD pinnatifid, the basal pinna; profoundly pinnatifid; mostly 
opposite, occasionally alternate; the basal pair of pinnre 
lanceolate in form, deflexed, and curving downwards away 
from the other pinnae; the next pair nearly straight, and the 
rest curving upwards more or less.
The attachment to the 
rachis is sessile with the basal pair, the second pair somewhat 
adnate, the remainder being attached throughout their whole 
width.
The upper pinna have their bases decurrent, being 
continuous on the rachis.
Lobes blunt.
Stipes usually more than half the length of the frond, 
upright, having a few thin scales at the base and minute hairs 
above.
The entire length of the frond, including the stipes, 
varies from four to twenty inches.
Colour pale green.
POLYPODIUM rilEGOrXERIS.
» 
Veius slender, thin, and flexuous, with alternate unbranclicd 
veinlets.
Sori naked, circular, and sub-marginal; the spore- 
cases minute, and pale bro\^Tiish in colour.
Spores ovate.
Rhizoma perennial, dark in colour, thin and creeping; roots 
black and fibrous.
I believe only one variety has been discovered of this 
interesting species, P.
phegopteris keeping very constant to its 
normal form.
The variety mentioned "was found by myself in 
great abundance in 1857, near Stockghyll Force, Ambleside, 
clothing the bank of a wet shady lane.
In this varietj' the 
form or general outline of the frond resembles that of the 
normal phegopteris, the distinctive feature being in the irregular 
multifid lobes; and occasionally in the apices of the pinnaj 
being also nudtifid.
This variety, under the name of imdtijidum, 
has been described on page 83 of my "Xatiual History of 
New and Rare Ferns." 
Should any of my readers visit that lovely portion of the 
English lake district near Ambleside, a short walk from the 
principal Inn will bring them to the lovely narrowly-confined 
waterfall knowTi as Stockghyll Force, and at a brief distance 
to the right they will be repaid by •witnessing the Beech 
Fern growing in the wildest profusion, clothing the banks in 
company with the Oak Fern, Lady Fern, and Common 
Polypody; whilst in the fields beyond, if in early summer, 
the beauty of the delicate pink Primula farinosa, with its 
silvery-powdered leaves and flower-stalks, intermingled with 
the purple butterwort, and the wavy snow-white heads of the 
cotton-grass, adds other charms to the spot.

Polypodium — From the Greek polys — many, and pous — a foot, 
in allusion to the branching rhizoma.
Alpestre — signifying a 
mountain, on account of its alpine situation.
A COMPARATIVELY reccntly-cliscoverecl species, growing only 
on the Scotch mountain'^, where it is abundant at an elevation of 
12 POLYPODIUM ALPESTRE.
from three to four thousand feet above the sea, and extending 
downwards to two thousand feet.
It has only been found in 
the Highlands of Scotland, in the counties of Perth, Forfar, 
Inverness, and Aberdeenshire.
Having a very similar appearance 
to some forms of the Lady Fern, it was confounded with 
that species, and therefore passed over without sufficient notice 
until recent botanists detected its true difference.
This Fern is widely spread in Europe, being a native of 
Germany, Switzerland, Lapland, Russia, Norway, Sweden, and 
the Caucasus.
Although so recently introduced, there arc several distinct 
varieties already in cultivation.
It is a pretty, delicate-looking, hardy Fern, and groAvs 
readily in a well-drained, loamy, porous compost.
It is 
propagated by spores, and also by divisions of the tufted 
caudex.
As yet it has not been discovered either in England, 
Wales, or Ireland.
The fronds, which are lanceolate in shape, and herbaceous, 
attain a length of from twelve to forty inches, the usual 
length being twenty inches.
The habit is upright, and the 
colour deep green.
Bipinnate, sometimes tripinnate.
Pinna3 
lanceolate-acuminate; pinnules oblong-ovate, profoundly pin- 
natifid, segments serrate.
The frond is broadest in the centre, 
narrowing to the base and apex.
The stipes is short, not 
one fourth the length of the rachis; on it are scattered pale 
brown scales.
Veins consisting of a tortuous mid-vein, from which proceed 
into each segment a pinnate branch; venules simple, extending 
nearly to the margin, and bearing sori considerably below 
their apices.
Sori circular and minute.
Spore-cases numerous, and of a 
brown colour.
Caudex perennial, brief, and decumbent.
Fronds annual, 
aj)pearing at the end of April.
The several varieties arc: — 
Var. Flexile.
— Occurring only on the Clova ^Mountains, where 
it was found in Glen Frosen, by Mr. Backhouse.
It is very 
handsome and distinct, being more slender and flaccid, the 
pinnsD shorter, and the pinnules much less in number.

stipes is almost wanting, the racliis extending nearly to the 
base of the frond.
The length varies from sLx to eighteen 
inches.
Pinnre brief, having only six or eight pairs of 
pinnules, which are oblong and narrowed below, and distantly 
dentate.
Sori few, chiefly at the base of the frond, the apex 
being barren.
Var. Tripinnatum.
— Fronds tripinnate and large, the pinnides 
attaining a length of an inch and a half; oblong-ovate.
Found 
by Mr. G.
Lawson at the AVells of Dee, in Aberdeenshire.
Var. Lanceum.
— Subtripinnate and large; the pinnules elongate, 
ovate-lanceolate more or less, and profoundly pinnatifid; the 
segments bluntly serrated.
This variety was found on the 
Clova Mountains, by ^Ir. G.
Lawson, and at Lochnagar, 
Aberdeenshire, by Mr. Croall.
Var. Laciniatum.
— Raised from spores in 1858, in the Fernery 
of Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden.
It is distinguished from 
the variety Flexile by its densely set and laciniated pinna; 
the pinna; are recurved towards the base of the stipes, brief, 
and rounded at the end; pinnules decurrent, variously dentate 
or laciniated, and densely set.
Veins branched; venules simply 
furcate.
Sori medial.

Flexile, from a plant in the possession of Messrs.
Stansfield,

Plate III — B.
the variety Laciniatum, also 
from the Fernery of Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden.
In 1841 ^Mr. AVatson gathered the P.
alpestre on Ben Aulder, 
in Invernesshire ; in 1844 a frond was brought from Canlochen 
Glen, in Forfarshire; and in 1852, !Mr. T.
Westcombe, and 
^Ir. Bacthouse, of York, procured it in great abundance in 
Canlochen, Glen Prosen, Glen Fiadh, and in all the Dee-side 
mountains.
^Nlr. Backhouse remarks, that at an elevation of 
from two to three thousand feet this Fern was found mingled 
with the Lady Fern; above this height the Lady Fern ceased, 
and left the Alpine Polypody in sole possession, flourishing 
most in the more exposed situations.
Mr. Moore seems to think that the plant known as Athyrium 
filix-foemina, var.
presinoi'sum, and found in some gardens under 
the name of var.
Aherdeenense, may prove to be a variety- of 
this species.

Polypodium — From the Greek polys — many, and pous — a foot, in 
allusion to the branching of the rhizoma.
Dryopteris — From the Greek 
Drus — an Oak, and pteris — a Fern.
Nothing can exceed tlie exquisite beauty of this plant, nor 
the refreshing coloiir of its most vivid green fronds.
Although 
they are annual, they spring up early in April, and where 
well established, there is soon such a dense miniature forest 
16 POLYPOBIUM DRYOPTERIS, 
of fronds, that it must always remain one of the most beautiful 
species of our cultivated Ferns.
In a wild state it is an 
inhabitant of mountainous rocky places, flourishing in shady 
woods or beneath hedges, and although growing in damp 
situations, it selects the driest places.
The Oak Fern, or, as 
it is sometimes called, the "Smooth Three-branched Polyj^ody," 
is easily cultivated, requiring no care beyond the selection of 
a proper place and suitable soil.
It is very hardy, and readily 
propagated by dividing the branching rhizoma.
This species is a companion of the Beech Fern, and occurs 
in the counties of Cheshire, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Durham, 
Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Lancashire, Northumberland, 
Oxford, Shropshire, Somersetshire, Staffordshire, Westmoreland, 
Worcestershire, and Yorkshire.
In Scotland and Wales very 
generally distributed.
In Ireland exceedingly rare.
A widely-spread European species, extending from Gibraltar 
to the North Cape, and equally wide-spread in America, 
extending from Columbia and Sitka to Labrador and Greenland.
A native also of the United States, Kamtschatka, Siberia, and 
Africa.
The fronds are pentangular-deltoid in form, three-branched, 
the branches being stalked and triangular in shape.
The two 
basal branches less than the central branch, and narrower; 
having also this distinction, — the terminal branch has the 
pinna?
equal in size on either side of the rachis, whilst in 
the basal pair the branches are placed at an obtuse angle, 
and the pinnte are much larger on the lower side of the 
rachis.
The fronds vary in size from four to twelve inches, 
and are smooth, membranaceous, and brilliant green in colour.
The branches are pinnatifid above, and pinnate at the base.
The pinnge opposite each other, pinnatifid above, and pinnate 
at the base, the apex being almost entire.
Pinnules oblong 
and crenate.
Stipes smooth, frequently two or three times the 
length of the rachis; erect in growth, slender, dark in colour, 
and slightly scaly at the base.
Rhizoma perennial, creeping, 
branching, and dark coloured; roots black and fibrous.
The 
undeveloped fronds, when first growing, resemble three small 
balls placed on slender wires.
There is a flexuous mid-vein, with alternate veins to each 
lobe, branching, and reaching the margin.
POLTPODIUM DRYOPTERIS.
17 
Sori scattered over the whole frond; situated below the 
apices of the basal venules, circular, abundant, but minute.
Spore-cases small, deep brown in colour; spores ovate.
Xo permanent varieties have been found of this handsome 
Fern, which is singularly constant to its normal form.
In its wild state the Oak Fern is quite a feature in the 
landscape, and when travelling amongst the mountains in hot 
summer days, there is a delicious coolness in the colour of 
the fronds that is refreshing to the pedestrian, and makes him 
remember with pleasure the Oak Fern — his mountain friend.

Polypodium — From the Greek polys — many, and pous — a foot, 
in allusion to the branching rhizoma.
Robertianum — Named after 
a botanist.
The present species bears considerable resemblance to the 
Polypodium dryopteris, but is readily distinguished by its more 
robust growth, and by the powdery-looking fronds.
It is 
confined to the limestone districts, and very local.
A hardy 
20 POLYrODIUM ROREETIANVM.
plant, very readily cultivated; and growing in exposed sunny 
parts of the Fernery, is a useful species if given suitable soil 
and good drainage.
The soil should be loamy, with a small 
portion of chalk or limestone, 
JPoltjpodium Rohertiamim, better known as the Pohjpodium 
calcareum, is found in several parts of Cumberland, in Derby- 
shire, (at Matlock, Buxton, and Wirksworth, where it grows 
abundantly,) in Gloucestershire, Lancfashire, Oxfordshire, Somer- 
setshire, Westmoreland, Wiltshire, and Yorkshire.
In Wales — 
Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire, and Glamorganshire.
I believe 
it is unknoAvn in Ireland and Scotland.
Its most abundant 
localities are Matlock, Buxton, and WirksAvorth, in Derbyshire, 
(in the latter locality I have seen many phmts;) Besbury 
Common, Gloucestershire; Arnside, Westmoreland; Settle and 
Anster Rocks, Yorkshire; and Merthyr Tydvil, in Wales.
Abroad it is a native of France, Switzerland, Germany, 
Hungary, and Norway.
On the Himalaya Mountains, and in 
Canada and the United States.
For some time there was a doubt as to whether this Fern 
should take rank as a species, or be considered merely as a 
variety of Polypodium dryopterts: our leading cryptogamic 
botanists have long since settled this question, regarding it as 
a distinct species.
The fronds, which grow erect, rigid, and elongate at the 
apex, are pentangular-deltoid and subternate, the lower branches 
bipinnate at their base, and stalked.
PinnjE obliquely-triangular, 
opposite, and briefly stalked; the basal pair considerably the 
largest, and bipinnate; the second pair briefly stalked or sessile, 
and pinnato-pinnatifid; the remainder sessile, pinnate, and then 
pinnatifid, becoming less and less divided towards the apex.
The pinnules of the basal pair of pinnro considerably larger on 
the lower side: all others almost equal.
Stipes much longer 
than the rachis; base scaly, stout, pale green, lateral, and 
adherent to the rhizoma.
Rhizoina perennial, branched, creeping, and scaly; root-fibres 
dark.
Length of frond from eight to eighteen inches, sometimes 
more; herbaceous and heavy greyish green, owing to minute- 
stalked glands covering both frond and stem.
Vernation circinate.
POLYPODIUM ROBERTIANUM.
21 
Veins alternately branched; venules simple or forked, and 
reaching the margin, and bearing a sorus near the margin.
Sori dispersed over the under side of the fronds, small, 
circular, and sub-marginal.
Spore-cases light-brown coloured; 
spores nearly ovate in form.
The pubescent covering of the fronds gives the plant the 
appearance of being dusted over with lime.
It is rather remarkable that it has not been found in Scotland.
One especial distinction of this species was pointed out by- 
Mr, Xewman, — the three portions of the young rolled-up frond 
never assume the appearance of three little balls, as in P.
dryojiteris ; and, moreover, imlike that species, it delights to 
grow in sunshine.
Hoffman's name of P.
Rohertianum has a prior claim to that 
of P.
calcareiim of Smith: this is to be regretted, as the 
latter is very appropriate.
Poly podium Rohertianum is not subject to variety.
Mr. INIoore remarks, that in the AVest of England this species 
only descends to two bundled and fifty feet above the sea, and 
in the north ascends to nine hundred feet.
Dr. Hooker found 
it on the Himalaya Mountains, at an elevation of from five to 
eight thousand feet.
Bolton was the first to point out the difference between the 
present species and P.
dryojyfcris, and Hoffmann to pronounce 
it a distinct species.
I am indebted to Mr. Joseph Sidebotham, of Manchester, 
and to the Eev. W.
Miller, (late curate of Wirksworth,) for 
plants of this species from different localities.
Very readily propagated from the extensive creeping rhizomas.
It is handsome in a Fernery.
The illustration is from a plant gathered on a limestone 
wall at Matlock Bath.

It is now, I believe, nearly twenty years since Mr. Newman 
published his interesting history of the British Ferns, In those 
days Ferns were imperfectly known, except to a few botanists, 
and his work was cordially welcomed by the public.
Those 
who are acquainted Avith the book will recollect a wood-cut 
illustration of an old tree, on the bole of which are cut 
the letters E.
N., the initials of Mr. Newman.
Looking 
higher up the tree, an epiphyte in the shape of a Fern has 
taken possession, and is clothing the forks from where the 
branches spring; and this Fern is the Common Polypody.
It 
is a Fern that delights to run along the ground amongst old 
wood and moss, keeping its rhizoma above the soil, delighting 
to grow in our hedge-rows, on rocks, walls, and stumps of trees.
It may justly be called a parasite — or rather an epiphytal 
plant — which seeks to hasten to destruction those trees where 
decay has made its appearance.
It is subject to much variety 
of form, departing in an extraordinary manner from the normal 
type, as a reference to the varieties hereinafter mentioned will 
shew.
One of the commonest and most universally-distributed British 
species, the localities being too numerous to mention.
It is 
found at every elevation from the sea level to a height of tAvo 
thousand one hundred feet.
In shady places it is evergreen, 
Polypodium vulgare delights in a damp situation, where there 
is abundance of drainage for its roots.
Abroad it is a native of Scandinavia, Sardinia, Sicily, Italy, 
Corfu, Madeira, Canary, Algiers, Erzeroum, Kamtschatka, 
Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, California, 
France, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland.
It is equally 
abundant in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and the 
Channel Islands.
The fronds are somewhat ovate-oblong, approaching linear- 
oblong in form, profoundly pinnatifid, and acuminate; lateral, 
narrow, usually subcoriaceous; sometimes erect in habit, at 
others drooping.
The lobes are flat and liucar-oblong in 
form, becoming shorter towards the apex of the frond.
Usually 
indistinctly serrated and blunt-pointed.
Stipes articulated with the caudex; mostly almost cqiud in 
length to the rachis.
Rhizoma creeping and branching, copiously clothed when 
POLYPODIUM WIG ARE.
JiO 
young witli brownish, deciduous, pointed scales, beneatli whicli,

Perennial.
Eoots fibrous, hairy, and branching.
The veins consist of a tortuous conspicuous mid-vein, which 
branches alternately.
The lateral veins branching into from 
three to five venules or veinlets.
In the barren frond the 
venules are free, ending in club-like heads which form a line 
near the eds;e of the lobes.
In the fertile lobes they terminate 
in a sorus.
Fructification usually confined to the upper portion of the 
under side of the frond.
Sori mostlv round, sometimes sub-oblong; eventually crowded 
and confluent.
Destitute of an indusium.
Spore-cases at first straw-colom-ed, turning to yellow, and 
then to orange.
Spores yellow.
Lensrth of frond from three to twcntv inches.
The peasants collect the fronds for theii' supposed medicinal 
value.
Keadily increased by divisions of the branched rhizoma, and 
well adapted for artificial rock-work.
Vernation circinate.
From the habit of this plant a character is added to the 
landscape where it grows.
A group of pollard willows clothed 
with Poll/podium vulgare are both singular and interesting.
The Matlock and Cromford Woods are carpeted over with 
this species, the rhizomas spreading along the rocks, and 
amongst the moss in the wildest profusion.
In higher, more 
exposed, and consequently more bleak situations, the form 
becomes compact, and the size considerably stunted.
A very 
dwarf variety, scarcely differing from the normal form, occurs 
along the raised banks of the hedges in the salt districts about 
Xorthwich, especially near AVincham; and a similar variety I 
noticed, subsequently, on Helvellyn and Fairfield, in the Lake 
District.
Some of my readers will doubtless remember on their visit 
to the English Lakes, a small house by the road-side at 
j^mbleside, covered with rock-work in the front, having only 
two rooms, and being two stories high, one room down stairs, 
and another reached by a stone staircase outside the house.
Some of thorn will have recollected this abode from the 
26 rOLYPODIUM VULGAllE.
profusion of Ferns that luxuriate amongst the rock-work, and 
completely clothe the house on the road side on the highway 
from Ambleside to Wordsworth's lovely residence at Rydal.
This house is occupied by a poor old man, a Fern collector, 
from whom can be procured most of the Ferns of the district, 
if he is still alive.
Several years ago, when I visited the 
spot, the Polypodium vulgare was growing most healthfully on 
the side of this house, associated with varieties of Scolopendrium 
vulgare, Polystichum angulare, the Lady Fern, Male Fern, 
Osmunda regalis, etc., interspersed with different species of 
club moss.
The man himself was ficcentric, but intelligent, 
and an excellent pilot to those who, like myself, secured 
his services as a guide to the different habitats of the Lake 
Ferns.
The visitor to the English Lakes must not overlook 
this remarkable house, which, I believe, is the oldest in 
Ambleside.
Polypodium vulgare requires a peculiar treatment under 
cultivation, — an imitation of nature as closely as possible.
The 
Ferns must be planted where they can take undisturbed 
possession of the place selected, as it is only when well 
established that they become really beautiful, and this occupies 
time to accomplish, — three or four years at least.
The locality 
should be shady, cool, and damp, without having stagnant 
moisture, for the roots cannot bear to grow in a drenched 
soil.
The soil to be prepared should be composed of leaf-mould, 
or a vegetable compost, interspersed with a cool, but not too 
moist clay or garden mould.
The soil must be light and 
porous, not stiff and retentive.
The rhizoma should not be 
buried in the ground, but fastened close down to it, the roots 
alone being covered.
The creeping stems seem to require 
both air and light.
When once established, the growth of the 
branching rhizoma is rapid.
There are many handsome varieties of Polypodium vulgare, 
amongst which Acutum-Stansfieldii, Cristatum, Crenatum, 
Camhricum, Compositum, Marginatum, Omnilacerum, Ohtusum, 
Pulchcrrimum, Semilacerum, Serrulatum, and Truncatum are the 
most distinct.
Some varieties are more permanent than others, 
and seedling plants from well-marked fronds will be more 
permanent in character than divisions of the rhizoma, although 
by this means other varieties will frequently appear; never-

theless, this is an advantage, inasmuch as there is a great 
probability of something more remarkable being found amongst 
the batch of seedlings, whilst, at the same time, there will be 
many resembling the frond from which the spores have been 
gathered.
The varieties of Polypodium tulgare comprise —

Also Bowness, and in Patter dale, English Lakes, by Mr.
Joseph Sidebotham, of Manchester.
This variety differs from 
the normal species only in the tips of the lobes tapering into 
a longish acute point.
In the true form the lobes are not 
even serrulate, and never serrate.

Mr. Barnes; and near Cark, by Mr. Stansfield.
This Fern has 
been known as Acutum, bat as it is perfectly distinct from 
the true form of that variety, I have taken the liberty of 
adding Stansfieldii to it.
Unlike Acutum it is a broad-fronded 
variety, with long, narrow, acute, pointed lobes.
Very handsome.

Westmoreland, near Lake Windermere, in the vicinity of 
Bowness.
The fronds are normal in outline, the lobes being 
strongly eared or aurite, next the rachis, and deeply dentate 
on the inferior margin; almost lacinate.
A very pretty Fern, 
and, as yet, proves constant.
Fertile.

Cambricum, WiUdenoic.
(Fig. 13.) — This splendid Fern 
was originally found in AVales, and named the AVelsh Polypodr, 
and recently in a wood near Macclesfield.
Mr. Joseph 
Sidebotham, of ^lanchester, has found it at Mill Dingle, 
Beaumaris, Conway Castle, Troutbeck, near Ambleside, and 
at Flenarim, Antrim, Ireland.
It has long been known as 
a British gem, and is quite constant and true in its character.
Cambricum has a much denser growth, is somewhat ovate- 
oblong in form, and is throughout bipinnatifid.
The lobes 
are narrow near the rachis, become wide in the centre, and 
narrowing again to a pointed apex; they are crowded together 
so as to overwrap each other, except at the base and apex 
(of the lobes.) The margin is deeply cut into narrow, 
pointed, serrated lobules, with the exception of their base 
and apex.
This beautiful species is always barren.
Under 
pot culture, as an exhibition plant, it can scarcely be

(Fig. l-i.) — Found by Mr. Elworthy, 
near Xettlecombe, and by Mr. Clowes, near Windermere.
It 
is difficvJt to describe Compositum, as it rarely produces two 
fronds alike.
A very interesting Fern, combining the variations 
peculiar to Auritum, Bifidum, Smuatum, Serratum, and 
Semilacerum.
It is smaller than the normal species.
Often 
on the same fiond there will be a combination of several 
varieties, and always on the same plant; that is, some will be 
more or less sinuate, and others more or less bifid or serrate- 
It inclines more to Sinuatum than to Bijidum or Serratum.

CoRiACEO-BiFiDUM, MonJcman.
(Fig. 15.)— Found in the year 
1857 or 1858, on a dry wall at Low Hutton, near Malton, by Mr.
Monkman.
In its wild state, it lias proved itself quite constant.
Mr. Monkman remarks on this variety, — "Under cultivation it 
is not so permanently bifid as could be wished, until well 
established and left undisturbed at the roots.
Rather than 
turn out to re-pot, plunge pot and all into a larger one.
The 
form is very handsome, dwarfish, and (apart from its bifid 
lobes) its peculiarities are an extremely leathery texture, (hence 
the name I propose,) peculiarly loose epidermis, and immense 
fructification.
If a lobe is bent, the epidermis will be found to 
wrinkle: this is very curious.
The form has never been figured, 
nor, to my knowledge, described; and having stood the test of 
years, I think it may now rank as an acknowledged varietj'." 
A short-fronded, remarkably leathery, broad, erect-growing 
variety.
The lobes, particularly the lower pairs, are bifid or 
trifid; and occasionally the frond.
The margins of the frond 
frequently slightly serrated.
The fructification is particularly 
large, the spore-cases almost joining.
In the autumn the 
conspicuousness of the fructification and the \'ivid yellow of 
the spores cause quite a golden appearance, a la the Gold 
Ferns, as Mr. C.
Monkman remarks.
Mr. Monkman adds that 
when he first saw it at a distance, he well remembers supposing

it to be Sedum acre in bloom.
Tlie apical lobes are rough, 
abnost papillose on the upper surface, the protuberances being 
caused by the large spore-cases.
The epidermis, where not 
clad "with the fructification, seems quite separated from the 
upper skin, and, as the discoverer says, readily wrinkles — a 
peculiar feature.
It still grows plentifully at Low Hutton.
Crenatum, Mo(yre.
(Fig. 16.) — Gathered near Ruthin, by 
Mr. Pritchard; Conway Castle, by Dr. Allchin and Mr. Stans- 
field; Devonshire, by Mr. Hillman; Saltwood, by Mr. Gray; at 
^lucruss, Ireland, by Dr. Allchin; and on Carberry Island, near 
Atlilone, by Captain A.
S. H.
Lowe.
Much larger than the 
ordinary form, and much thinner in texture.
The fronds are 
broad and ovate.
The margins of the lobes obscurely crenated 
or crenato-lobate ; frequently undulated.
A most interesting 
variety, but inconstant, often running into Serratuiii, and 
ultimately becoming Semilacerum.
Sori sometimes oblong.
My 
brother found both Semilacerum and Crenatum growing together 
on Carberry Island.
Cristatum, Perry, MS.
(Plate VII — A.) — Discovered in 
Ireland by Mr. Henry S.
Perry, of Rock Lodge, Monkstown, 
County Cork.
First figured in my "Natural History of Xew 
and Rare Ferns," Plate XXVI — B, and described on page ^Z 
of that work.
Mr. R.
Sim, of Foot's Cray, having purchased 
the stock of this very distinct variety; it is therefore now 
finding its way into collections.
The present plant has multifid or tasseled apices to every 
pinna, the midvein of each 'being divided and branching about 
a quarter of an inch below the apex.
The rachis is also 
divided and bifid about an inch below the apex of the frond.
The variety Cristatum, from the points of each frond beino- 
branched and crested, and all its divisions terminating in 
crested tufts, so as to form a frilled margin, is both distinct 
and beautiful.
The sori are large and prominent, coveriu"- 
the whole under side of the upper half of the frond quite to 
the apex.
When first discovered, Mr. Perry forwarded me a 
frond with a small portion of rhizoma attached: this was 
planted, and grew, and is still quite true to its original 
character.
Length from six to nine inches.

Dentatum, Monhman, MS.
(Fig. IT.) — Found, I believe in 
1859, growing upon a bridge in the grounds of Fountains Abbey, 
Ripon, Yorkshire, by Mr. C.
Monkman, of Malton.
A very 
robust form, resembling Acutuni in general outline, but when 
well established has the lobes, especially the lower pairs, very 
deeply toothed, and sometimes bifid.
An extremely handsome 
large-growing form, the fronds attaining eighteen inches and 
upwards in length, and eight or nine inches in width.
Sub- 
permanent in cultivation, but tolerably characteristic if left un- 
disturbed at the roots.
When vigorous, Dentatum has a tendency 
to approach Semilacerum in its characters, and one form has 
grown into the other.
A very handsome form of this variety 
has been found by Mr. Clowes, of Windermere.

also near Hutton Railway Bridge, in the neighbomhood of 
Malton, very sparingly, by Mr. C.
Monkman.
This Fern is of 
the Ovatum type, and when growing, of a crispy appearance, 
the subsidiary rachides being wavy.
The sori are round, not 
long as in Serratiim, and large.
Rare.
Frond broad oblong, 
abrupt, and caudate at the apices, the margin of the lobes 
distantly and finely sharp-toothed, or saw-toothed.
Less coria- 
ceous.
Uppermost lobes not much shorter, and caudate at the 
apex, the whole of the lobes ascending.

irregular or interrujjted lobes; and here and there altogether 
absent.
Occasionally irregularly bifid, multifid, or curiously 
laciniated.
Fronds linear-lanceolate.
Found in 1851 and 1858 
at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston.
KRAsrEDOUMENON, Loioe.
(Fig. 23.) — See Marginatum, 
Moore, for remarks on this beautiful Fern.
Laciniatum, Moore.
— The lobes in Laciniatum vary in 
length on the same frond: they are simply, but irregularly 
notched and somewhat crisped.
This variety approaches 
Interruptum, and is doubtfully distinct.
Laciniatum puts on 
so many forms that it is difficult to procure a characteristic frond; 
under these circumstances I have refrained from giving an 
illustration.
LoBATUM, Sidehotham, MS.
(Fig. 20.) — Found by Mr.
Joseph Sidehotham, about 1843, in Troutbeck Valley, near 
Ambleside; subsequently near Bowness, and near Beddgelert, 
in North Wales.
Fronds large; lobes broad.
Auriculate on 
the upper edge of the lobes next the rachis, and crenulate; 
the upper lobes not auriculate nor crenulate.
Sori copious, 
but small.
A distinct variety.

Marginatum, Moore.
(Fig. 22.) — Found in Kent, by 
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, and at Windermere, by Mr. Clowes.
A 
remarkable and scarce variety, somewhat larger than the ordinary 
form.
The lobes of the frond blunt, the epidermis on the under 
side of the lobes, irregularly ruptured, split away as it were 
from the margin of the lobes, and receding towards the mid- 
vein.
Sometimes eared as in Auritum, as is the case in the 
Windermere form.
Mr. Clowes' variety is very different, as the 
wood-cut illustration will shew.
It seems desirable to separate 
these Ferns, at all events provisionally, and this I propose to do, 
using the Greek word, instead of the Latin, the name of Clowes' 
Fern will therefore be variety Kraspedoumenon.

(Fig. 25.) — Found by Mr.

In this very beautiful form, from one to three inches 
of the frond proper, consists usually of only a few short crested 
lobes here and there, and connected by a leafy wing, whilst 
occasionally the latter is alone present.
The marked feature in 
this variety, is its repeatedly short and leafy forkings, each 
alternate one crispy, the whole forming either a dense, flattish, 
or cucular, extremely handsome crest- A splendid variety.

Multiforme.
(Fig. 26.) — First discovered by Mr. F.
Clowes, 
at Windermere, then by Mr. Henry Perry, in County Cork, 
Ireland, and in 1859 in Wass Woods, near Coxwold, Yorkshire, 
by Mr. C.
Monkman, of Malton, and still later by Mr. J.
Cross- 
field, of Arnsidc, in that neighbourhood.
A very large-growing 
remarkable variety, stout in habit, and partaking freely of the 
characters of Semilacerum, Truncatum, and Serratum, and 
altogether extremely variable both in size and form.
Fronds 
broad, divided and lobed somewhat like the variety Semilacerum, 
but differing from that variety in being irregular, and in 
having a horn-like projection of the midrib of many of the 
abruptly-ending side divisions.
Long stalked.
Occasionally 
almost entire.
Some of the fronds are very broad, with more 
or less tapering narrowish lobes; other fronds similar, with 
lobes here and there shortened abruptly; others having only 
two or three pairs of divisions, (the lower ones,) and these 
profoundly crenate or serrate, — such fronds appearing as though 
the upper part had been suddenly stopped in growth, or 
broken out.

Obtusl'm, Stansfield, MS.
(Fig. 27.) — A pretty, small-fronded 
variety, though rather larger than the normal form, distinguished 
by the rounded edges of the lobes, which are very obtuse.
Gathered in North Wales, by Mr. Stansfield, of Todmorden, 
and in Devonshire, by Mr. Hillman.
Somewhat inconstant.
Omnilacerum, Moore.
(Plate VII — B.) — Found by ^Ir.
E. T.
Bennett, near Goodrich Castle, Ross, Herefordshire.
This 
exceedingly elegant, and distinct variety is still very rare.
Somewhat in the way of Camhricum, yet quite distinct 
from that variety.
It has the lobes irregularly pinnatifid, the 
lobules being narrow and jagged.
It differs from Camhricum 
in the narrow and less-crowded lobes, and in being fertile.
Length of frond from twelve to eighteen inches.
Habit 
nearlv erect.
Lobes narrowish next the rachis, widening towards 
^ • • • 
the middle, and tapering beyond.
Deeply cut into narrowish, 
often very attenuated acute lobules, which, towards the centre 
of the lobe, are often much projected, more particularly 
from the lower margin.
The deeply serrated lobes are 
sometimes nearly bipinnatifid.
Usually the frond is considerably 
longer than in Camhricum, the lobes having their di\dsions 
more acute, and more regular, than in that variety.
A constant 
and beautiful Fern.
A^'hilst young, the divisions are sharply 
and deeply toothed — exceedingly saw-edge-like; when stronger 
these teeth lengthen very much into very slender lobules, wliich 
are again a little torn, or toothed.

The 
lowest lobes horizontal.
Allied to Denticulatum.

PuLCHERRiMUM, Stansfielcl , 3IS.
(Fig. 28.) — This Fern does

It was gathered near 
Milnthorpe, in the summer of 1861, by Mr. Barnes, and is now 
in the possession of Messrs.
Stansfield, of the Vale Gardens, 
Todmorden.
The fronds are from eight inches to a foot in 
length, and from four to eight inches in breadth.
Ovate-oblong 
in form, bipinnatifid in the lower and middle portions of the 
frond, and deeply serrated in the upper portion.
Perhaps the 
most beautiful of all the British Polypodiums, differing from 
Camhricum, in being much thicker in texture, in all the lobes 
and lobules being blunt and rounded, (which gives a peculiar 
softness and smoothness of outline to the fronds,) and in 
being abundantly soriferous.

the Dargle, AVicklow, where the fronds are well marked.
Also 
in Devonshire, Norfolk, (Postwich,) Kent, Monmouth, and 
Caernarvonshire; growing in the calcareous districts of England, 
AVales, and Ireland.

An exceedingly handsome Fern, not characteristic till of 
good size and well established, then constant under cultivation.
The fronds are from twelve to eighteen inches in length, 
pinnatifid and fertile above, deeply bipinnatifid below.
The 
lower segments barren, upper ones crenate and fertile, the 
fructification bold and prominent.
Underneath the frond is 
paler, and of a sub-glaucous green colour.
Lobules distinct, 
linear, acute, and serrate.
Fronds broad.
The lobes long, 
and very wide in the middle, and these profoundly cut into 
lesser and closely-set lobules, the lobules being frequently

A handsome bifid form, with long narrow fronds, 
the lower lobes of which are pretty uniformly divided (bifid 
or trifid,) and all, more especially towards the apex, very 
prettily and finely serrated.
The apices of the fronds are 
drawn out into a long, tapering, acute, lobe -like termination, 
also serrated.
The apex is occasionally bifid or multifid.
A 
beautiful Fern, but, like most of the bifid forms, somewhat 
inconstant in cultivation.
Mr. Monkman has found a similar 
but broader form at Byland Abbey, Yorkshire.

Variegatum.
— Found at Oldstead, Yorkshire, by ^Ir. C.
^lonkman, of Malton, and near Cark, Lancashire, by Messrs.
Stansfield.
The fronds are acute, in fact those of Acutum, 
the distinction being in the variegation.
It is pretty distinctly 
striped with yellowish white stripes, but a very inconstant variety.
The plant Mr. Stansfield found is coriaceous, nearly normal 
in outline, and marbled above with yellow blotches.
It does 
not prove constant under cultivation.
It has been considered 
useless giving an illustration of this variety.
There are no less than thhly-seven varieties of Polypodium 
vulgare, many of which are exceedingly interesting.
It is quite 
true that a portion of these are not constant in cultivation, and 
are liable to run into several varieties; yet others are perfectly 
constant, and all are more or less beautiful.
These varieties 
have each been described and figured, therefore a reference to 
the coloured plates and woodcut illustrations will at once point 
out how very varied has been the departure from the normal 
form of P.
vulgare.
AVhat other varieties a few years hence 
may bring to light it is impossible to say: when Nature puts 
on these sports there seems to be no limits.
A new field is 
open to the British Fern cultivator, the last few years have 
added so many varieties that a British Fernery, replete, not 
only with the species, but also with the varieties of those 
species, is an imposing addition to the flower-garden.
The 
British Ferns that contain the most varieties are Polypodium 
vulgare, Polystichum angidare, Lastrea Jilix-mas, L.
dilatata, 
Athyrium JUix-fceniiua, Scolopendrium culyare, and Blechnum 
spicant.
ALLOSORUS.

GENUS n.
ALLOSOEUS.
Berxhardi.
This genus is represented in Great Britain by a solitaiy 
species.
The fronds are herbaceous, dimorphous, bi-tripinnate, the 
fertile fronds contracted and erect in habit; the barren fronds 
much resembling parsley.
In general appearance the Allosorus 
bears some resemblance to the genus Pteris, but the fructification 
is more nearly allied to Polypodium, the receptacles are puncti- 
form, and the sori non-indusiate ; eventually confluent.
The 
revolute margin of the pinnules covers the sori.
Veins simple, or forked from a central costa.

58 ALLOSORUS CRISPUS.
Allosorus — From tlie Greek alios — various, and sorus — a lioap.
Crisp us — Curled.
TiiTS is really a cliarmlng Fern, and an ornament wherever 
planted.
In its native wilds it is found growing amongst loose 
stones, or in the crevices of rocks, adding much to the beauty 
of its home.
It is a Fern not readily forgotten when seen in 
all the luxuriance of wildness, growing amongst the shapeless 
masses of a profusion of loose stones on the sides of a mountain.
The vivid greenness of its fronds contrasts greatly with the 
sombre hue of its few companions.
A local species, occurring in the counties of Cheshire, Lan- 
cashire, Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, Northumberland, 
Derbyshire, Shropshire, Somersetshire, Worcestershire, and 
Yorkshire.
In Wales, in Caernarvonshire, Montgomeryshire, 
Denbighshire, Glamorganshire, (rare,) and Merionethshire.
In 
Ireland it is extremely local, occurring only in the counties of 
Down, Antrim, and Louth.
In Scotland widely spread, being 
found in almost every county.
In England it is exceedingly 
abundant on the mountains of Northumberland, Cumberland, 
Durham, and Westmorland, (especially on Cheviot, Helvellyn, 
Skiddaw, Fairfield, Scawfell Pikes, Keswick, Derwentwater, 
Ennerdale, Borrowdale, Teesdale, and Lothrigg Fell.) In Lan- 
cashire on the moor behind the town of Lancaster, and in 
Yorkshire on Cronkley Scar, Wensleydale, Fountain's Fell, 
Ingleborough, and Settle.
Mr. Monkman remarks that it grows in great profusion at 
the Lancaster station, setting the smoke from the silk mills at 
defiance.
An additional attraction to a tourist to visit this moor 
is the prospect — one of the finest in our country.
Abroad it is a native of France, Italy, Spain, Germany, 
Hungary, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Lapland, 
and at Sitka, in North-west America.
The Allosorus crispus has received a variety of names; 
Linngeus considered it to belong to the genus Osmunda, and 
afterwards changing his opinion, placed it among the Pteris 
family; Villars declared it to be an Acrostichum, liartmann a 
Blechnum, R.
Brown a Stegania and a Cryptogramma, Hoffmann 
an Onoclea, Wallroth a Struthiopteris , Desvaux called it Phor- 
olohus, and Bernhardi Allosorus.
Desvaux, Brown, and Bernhardi 
ALI.OSORUS CRISPUS.
59 
created a new genus for the Rock Brakes.
That it is a very 
distinct Fern there can be no doubt, and Bernhardi did well 
to make it a new genus.
^\Tien the Allosorus crispus grows luxuriantly, the mountain 
sides that are taken possession of by it, resemble at a distance 
verdant meadows; and it is only on a near approach that this 
vivid green resolves itself into the many-fronded plants of the 
Rock Brakes.
In the English lakes the mountain sides of 
Lothrigg Fell and Fairfield are instances of this; and the former 
being easily reached from Ambleside, will well repay the tourist 
making its steep but not lengthy ascent.
Lothrigg Fell is soon 
reached from the principal inns of Ambleside, the ascent being 
made on the Windermere side, not far from the lovely situated 
church of Brathay.
Passing through a steep field of Allosorus 
crispus, the summit is gained, and on the one side there is the 
Lily Tarn, spoken of by Wordsworth, backed in the distance 
by Helvellyn, Fairfield, and Langdale Pike; whilst on the other, 
overlooking the head of the lake, there is a magnificent and 
never-tOTbe-forgotten view down AVindermere, especially from 
the stone-piled erection left by the ordnance survey.
Here the 
artist has a vast scope for his pencil, whilst the poet fails in 
words expressive enough in his endeavour to describe what he 
sees before him; painting in the language of inspiration, or 
delineatinsr on canvas such scenes as these, are indeed tasks of 
no ordinary kind, and each must feel dissatisfied with his labours 
when he sees they fall short of the reality.
In Allosorus crispus the sterile and fertile fronds are different.
The sterile ones are bi-tripinnate, the pinnae alternate or sub- 
opposite, (more especially below,) spreading, and triangular-ovate 
in form, the lowest pinnae being the largest, and each succeediag 
pair diminishing rapidly in size towards the apex.
The pinnules, 
which are ovate, are largest on the posterior side; they are 
pinnate or pinnatifid.
The lobes are obovate-cuneate, having 
bifid lobules with acute incurved teeth, the smaller ones not 
bifid, but having linear acute teeth.
The frond smooth, usually 
the leafy portion half the length of the frond, frequently more.
The fertile fronds contracted, the leafy portion being only half 
the length of the stipes.
Tri-quadripinnate, the pinnae spreading 
and ovate, pinnules pinnate, ovate, pinnato-pinnatifid, or bi- 
pinnate, lobes stalked, linear or linear-oblong.

ALLOSORUS CRISPUS.
Fronds varying from four to twelve inches in length; colour 
pale green, delicate, and vivid.
Herbaceous.
E-hizoma perennial, brief, tufted, and having pale brown 
scales; roots wiry, branching, and dark in colour.
Stipes slender, 
smooth, and pale green, either equal in length to the leafy 
portion of the frond, or longer.
Veins of the fertile frond consisting of a flexuous midvein, 
with alternate simple or occasionally forked veinlets reaching 
nearly to the margin of the lobes; whilst in the sterile frond 
they are repeatedly furcately branched, passing through the 
centre to the margin of each segment, and being forked with a 
bifid, and simple with a simple segment.
Sori hid beneath the reflexed margins of the pinnules, which 
nearly join at the midrib, eventually confluent.
Spore cases small, 
spores smooth and roundish oblong, sometimes somewhat angular.
In Lancashire the "Rock Brakes," or "Mountain Parsley 
Fern," flourishes at nearly the sea level, whilst in the Highlands 
of Scotland it is found at an elevation of three thousand four 
hundred and fiftv feet.

A PRETTY diminutive Fern, the only British, representative 
of the lovely genus of Gymnogramma so well known and 
esteemed in hot-houses for their gold and silver fronds.
To 
those who are unacquainted with these hot-house favourites, it 
may be mentioned that Gymnogramma chrysophylla, G.
U Herminieri, G.
ochracea, and G.
sulphurea have a copious 
golden powder on the under side of the fronds, and that G.
tartarea, G.
calomelanos, G.
pulchella, G.
Peruviana, etc., have 
this powder of a silvery or white hue; hence the popular 
name of *'Gold and Silver Ferns." 
As a British plant it is only an inhabitant of the Island of 
Jersey, where it grows plentifully in several places, more 
especially near St. Aubin's, St. Haule, and St. Lawrence.
It is a native of France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, 
Sicily, Greece, Portugal, the Canary Isles, Azores, Madeira, 
Algiers, Morocco, Abyssinia, Cape of Good Hope, Mexico, 
Vera Cruz, Victoria, Tasmania, New Zealand, India, the Atlantic 
Isles, and the Islands in the Persian Gulf.
Gymnogramjna leptophylla selects moist banks having a south 
or south-west aspect: in these situations it is found growing 
amongst mosses (especially Fissidens hryoides) and liverwort, 
{Marchantia polymorpha.) It is an annual, springing up in 
November, developing fronds in January, and being fully 
grown by the middle of April.
Its spores are scattered, and 
the plant itself dead by the end of July.
G. leptophylla, although in other respects very distinct, 
nevertheless has the delicate fragile semblance of the Cystopteris 
family, and with the exception of G.
clicarophylla, a West 
GYMXOGRAMMA LEPTOPHYLLA.
66 
Indian species of much larger growth, and also an annual, is 
very different in appearance to other memhers of this lovely 
family.
On account of the present Fern heing an annual, the 
cultivator is compelled to raise it year by year from spores.
If planted in light loam, using plenty of fine washed sand, 
and kept moist by means of a bell-glass, it may be grown 
with success.
^Mien cultivated in a greenhouse, G.
leptophylla 
bears spores so freely that plants are almost certain to spring 
up in some of the surrounding pots without further trouble.
It is, however, desirable to provide against disappointment by 
sowing spores, and the following plan answers remarkably well: 
— ^A seed saucer is filled within an inch of the top with 
drainage, upon this is a layer of sphagnum moss, above which 
is a mixture of loam, leaf-soil, sand, and broken sphagnum.
The sphagnum to mix with the soU.
must be perfectly dry, 
for it should be broken into small pieces by rubbing between 
the hands.
A^Tien the pan is prepared, let it be well watered, 
and allowed to remain for several hours before the spores are 
sown.
After the spores have been scattered on the surface of 
the soil, a hand-glass must be placed over the saucer, and the 
air excluded by tightly packing with wet sphagnum all round 
the outside of the base of the glass.
If managed in this 
manner the spores will not require watering for a length of 
time, and this is a great advantage, for watering is not desirable 
if it can by any possibility be avoided; however the soil must 
not on any account be allowed to become dry, otherwise the 
young Ferns will without doubt perish.
If the spores have 
been rubbed from a fresh mature frond, they will be almost 
certain to grow.
Some species are several months before 
they germinate.
If successfully grown under a bell-glass, after 
the plant has died spores Avill presently spring up to take 
possession of the same pot.
As it has been before stated, G.
"leptophylla takes its position 
amongst British plants from the circumstance that it is a native 
of one of the Channel Islands.
Geographically speaking, the 
flora of these islands is not that of England, being identical 
with the flora of France.
It is therefore politically, and not 
geographically, a British plant.
Indeed reference to a map 
will at once shew that these Islands are not only much further 
66 GYMlSrOGRAMMA LEPTOPHYLLA, 
west than any portion of England, but that they are situated 
within a very few miles of the French coast.
The fronds are glabrous and fragile, few in number, usually 
only two or three; erect in habit, oblong-ovate in form, and 
bi-trip innate ; the pinnse are alternate, and ovate-triangular in 
shape, the pinnules being also alternate, and cuneate at their 
base, three-lobed, their apices being bluntly bidentate.
Length of frond from three to eight inches.
Colour a pale 
yellowish green.
Veins dichotomously branched.
The fructification covers 
the whole of the under side of the frond.
Sori linear and 
forked, being situated along the ultimate veinlets, eventually 
confluent.
The spore-cases are abundant.
The stipes usually longer than the fronds, smooth and shining, 
and of a rich brown colour at the base; terminal and adherent.
Caudex minute and sub-globose, mostly annual, sometimes 
bi-annual.
Besides the ordinary fronds there are several small somewhat 
fan-shaped fronds, and others pinnate with fan-shaped pinnae, 
the latter fronds only two inches in length; the lobes vary in 
being larger and more expanded, ^nd in being mostly barren.
There are no varieties of this species.

The present species is one but seldom seen growing wild 
by Fern cultivators, on account of its peculiarly local and 
mountain habitats, growing at an elevation of from one thousand 
two hundred to above three thousand feet.
It must also rank 
amonsrst our rarer British Ferns.
70 POLYSTICHUM LONCHITIS.
Found only in tlie fissures of rocks near the summits of 
the highest and bleakest mountains of England, Scotland, 
Ireland, and Wales.
It is a native of Lapland, Iceland, 
Sweden, Denmark, and Russia in the north, extending throughout 
Europe, being foTind in France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, 
Germany, Hungary, and Greece.
Found also in Xorth America, 
Kamtschatka, Asia Minor, Kashmir, and on the Altai Mountains.
The mountain traveller occasionally meets with this plant, 
often in places difficult of access, and, even where accessible, 
frequently most difficult to be removed from its native wilds, 
and still more difficult to cultivate, when obtained under the 
most advantageous circumstances, as indeed are many other 
mountain plants.
The difference of the pressure of the 
atmosphere between the sea level and several thousand feet 
above the sea, is alone an important matter of consideration, 
and one that cannot be overcome.
We may imitate nature 
very closely in regard to soil, rocky situation, moisture, and 
temperature, but we cannot remove the extra pressure of the 
air upon the plant; and this sooner or later, I fear, is 
sufficient in most instances to destroy its vitality.
It is seldom 
that a specimen is seen flourishing under cultivation.
As a British plant it is found on the mountains at Settle, 
Attermire Scar, and Ingleborough, Yorkshire; and on the Falcon 
Glints, Teesdale, in Durham.
In Wales on the mountains 
above LI anberis, at Glyder-vawr, and on Snowdon, (below 
Crib-y-Destilh.
In Scotland it is more spread, being a native 
of Sutherland, Ross, Inverness, Moray, Aberdeen, Forfar, Perth, 
Argyle, and Dumbarton, the chief stations being Ben More, 
in Sutherlandshire, Ben Lawers and Craig Challiach, in 
Perthshire, the Clova Mountains, Glen Fiadh, and Craig Maid, 
in Forfarshire: it has been said also to *be an inhabitant of 
the Orkney Islands.
In Ireland this Fern diflfers considerably 
in its form: it is found on the Rosses and Thanet Passes, in 
the county of Donegal, on the Ben Bulben Mountains, in the 
county of Sligo, and on Brandon Hill, in the county of Kerry.
The bleak, cold, exposed situations in which PolysticJmm 
lonchitis grows proclaim this Fern to be the most hardy of 
the British species.
Its fronds are exceedingly rigid, and well 
calculated to resist the blast of those exposed mountains on 
which it luxuriates.
It is an evergreen species.
POLYSTICHUM LOXCHITIS.
71 
The fronds, wliicTi are linear-lanceolate in shape, are pinnate, 
the pinnae being numerous and crowded, briefly stalked or 
sessile, and lanceolate-falcate, acute, on the anterior base 
auricled, the posterior base being obliquely cuneate, the 
margins covered with spiny serratures.
The stipes mostly very short, varying from half an inch to 
three inches in length, and covered with a profusion of large, 
brown-coloured, chaffy scales, the rachis having numerous 
narrower scales.
The caudex thick, scaly above; roots wiry 
and dark-coloured.
The length of frond is usually from six to eighteen inches, 
occa<ionallv as much as twenty-four inches.
Colour deep green 
above, paler beneath.
Veins consisting of a midvein, which extends to the apex of 
the frond, from which proceeds a vein up each pinna, which 
is forked and branching two, three, or four times, extending 
veinlets into each of the marginal teeth.
The fructification is mostly confined to the upper half of the 
frond; the sori being situated in a line on either side of the 
midvein, about midway between the midvein and the margin; 
circular.
Indusium membranaceous, orbicidar, and attached to 
the receptacles by a brief central stalk.
Spore-cases globose 
and numerous; spores roundish and small.
Although there are only two varieties of this species described, 
still the Irish form is so distinct that it seems desirable to 
distinguish it fr-om the English form, which I propose to do 
under the name of Confertum.
CoxFERTUM, Lowe.
(Fig. 48.) — The Irish form of Polystichum 
lonchitis, smaller in size, the pinna; more numerous, narrower, 
and more crowded together, overlapping each other.
Pinnae 
usually opposite or siib-opposite below, and alternate above.
In this form the auricle of the base is hid by the pinna 
immediately above overlapping it.
Mr. AVollaston has described two other varieties, namely: — 
Multijidum.
— Havmg the apex divided.
Proliferum.
— Producing small bulbils in the axils of the 
lowermost pinnae.
The variety Multijidum is not constant, and the variety 
Proliferum is of the normal form, it is therefore unuecessarv 
to s^ivc illustrations of them.
i)i POLYSTICHUM LONCHITIS.
It is useless to plant this Fern in an open or out-door 
Fernery, as it will only have a miserable existence.
In a cool 
moist frame, if potted firmly in well-drained soil, it may 
sometimes be kept in health, if it can once be established.
It 
is desirable, in collecting PolysticJmm lonchitis, to select only 
the smaller plants, and to take especial care not to injure the 
roots.
Large plants it is perhaps impossible to remove 
successfully.

POLYSTirnUM AXGT'LAllE.
This widely distributed British species is a most lovely Fern.
Ricli dark green in colour, it contrasts well with the pale 
green of the Polypodium dryopteris ; and retaining its fronds 
throughout the winter, it is necessarily a desirable species to 
be extensively cultivated in our Ferneries.
Of late years many 
remarkable varieties have been found growing wild, or have 
been raised from spores; so that the forms put on in the fronds 
of one or other of the varieties are extensive, and many of them 
exceedingly beautiful.
We have them large in size, or very 
dwarf, we have the broad-fronded, and narrow-fronded.
The 
pinnules large, and more or less circular, and small and almost 
linear.
We have the almost undivided pinnae and pinnules, 
and those that are extensively and profoundly divided.
There 
are varieties branching from the base, others from the apex, 
the apices of the fronds and of the pinnae are multifid, or 
crested, others proliferous, in short there is a great departure 
from the normal form in many of the varieties.
Some of the 
forms of Polystichum angulare approach Polystichum aculeatum, 
so as to make it difficult to state where P.
angulare ends and 
P. aculeatum begins; the latter Fern differs very much from the 
former in one respect, being almost without variation in form, 
and singularly constant in its characters.
Mr. WoUaston, of Chisselhurst, has paid a considerable amount 
of attention to this Fern, and has a very fine collection of its 
varieties; and Mr. James, of Vauvert, and Mr. Monkman, of 
Malton, amongst amateurs; and Messrs.
Sim, of Foot's Cray, 
and Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, Nurserymen, have some 
fine varieties.
Nearly eighty years ago our Cryptogamic botanists were 
mindful of the few varieties of British Ferns that had then 
been discovered.
James Bolton, of Halifax, in his "Filices 
Britannica," — "An History of the British Proper Ferns," men- 
tions on the title-page, *'New Figures of all the Species and 
Varieties;" and in his "Introduction," written in August, 1785, 
he says, "For the satisfaction of those who desire further in- 
formation, I have figured several varieties in Tab.
!:?," and he 
goes on to enumerate them, namely, "In Ophioylossum tulyatum 
there is a variety which produces several seed-spikes.
In 
Asplenium tricJiomanes there is a variety having the leaves 
divided into several lobes, which are crenated on the extremities 
POLYSTICHIM AKGUI.ARE.
75 
in an elegant and beautiful manner.
In very moist and rich 
situations the leaves of Asplenium viride sometimes become 
proliferous, tbi-owing out other leaves from their sides.
There 
is a variety of Asplenium marinum wherein the lobes are diHded 
and subdivided; this has been named Adiantum trapeziforme.
The Polypodium camhricum is now known to be a Variety of 
Poly podium vulgar e.
There is also another variety of the same 
plant, lately discovered by my esteemed friend Mr. Alexander, 
of Halifax, in a wood near Bingley.
There is a tall slender 
varietv of Polypodium fragile which has been taken notice of, 
and termed Polypodium rheticum.
There is a variety of Tri' 
chomanes Tunhrigense which grows in little caverns under moist 
rocks, where the sun is excluded, and where the water, dripping 
from the points of the leaves, enlarges them greatly; in this 
state the plant has been taken notice of, and called Trichotnanes 
pyxidiferum.
The varieties of Asplenium scolopendrium are 
many and very well known.
Asplenium adiantum-nigrtimi 
Polypodium aculeatum, and some others are likewise subject td 
varieties." 
Thus so early as 1785 we find botanists describing varieties 
of British Ferns.
"We also find Bolton urging the cultivation 
of British Ferns.
He says, "]\Iany of the Ferns might with 
great propriety be introduced into our botanic gardens; not 
merely with a view to increase the number of plants in these 
gardens, but also on account of the agreeable contrast they 
produce when interspersed amongst plants of all the other 
classes, of their own beautiful singularity, and of the great ease 
with which they are procured and preserved.
In the hot-house 
or stove they become evergreens, and their beauty is greatly 
improved in respect to colour and delicacy.
AVhen planted in 
pots, and placed amongst other plants, their soft, feathery, 
silken clumps produce an efiect which must be pleasing to 
every one." 
Bolton does not recognise the present species, figuring only 
P. lonchitis and P.
acideatum, no doubt confusing P.
angulare 
with the latter species, which indeed is so nearly allied to it 
that in some of the varieties there is as much similarity to P.
aculeatum as to P.
angulare.
This most interesting Fern has an extended though somewhat 
local range over England and Wales, being most plentiful in 
70 rOI.YSTICMU.M ANGULARK.
tlu^ south and south-west.
It is common in Cornwall, and 
somewhat abundant at Chaigeley, in Lancashire.
Somersetshire, 
Devonshire, Hants, Surrey, Sussex, and Kent are also favoured 
counties.
In Ireland it is also abundant, whilst in Scotland- it 
is only recorded as occurring in Argyleshire and Berwickshire.
It is a native of Sweden, Norway, France, Spain, Italy, 
Greece, the Channel Islands, the coast of the Black Sea, India, 
Georgia, Abyssinia, Natal, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Azores, 
United States, Sitka, Mexico, Guatemala, Caraccas, Java, New 
Grenada, and Singapore.
In England this plant prefers lowland shady woods or hedge 
banks where the soil is moist.
In 1860, I found it in Spain 
growing from two thousand to three thousand feet above the 
sea, on a mountain known as the Villia Escusa, between Reinosa 
and AUar. This mountain is one of the spurs of the Pyrenees, 
and near the summit rocks rise up in lines like streets, so much 
so that it is difficult to find the way amongst them; in shady 
parts where the ground sinks below the surrounding level from 
three to ten feet, and where these well-like holes are narrow 
and much confined the Polystichum angulare is found growing 
amongst other Ferns, serving as a shelter to the numerous 
wolves and foxes that have taken possession of these heights.
The "Angular Shield Fern," or, as it is sometimes called, 
**The Soft Prickly Shield Fern," for distinction from the 
"Common Prickly Shield Fern," is herbaceous and evergreen.
The fronds are usually lax, lanceolate in form, and bipinnate.
The pinnules are distinct and various in form, acute or nearly 
linear to obtuse or broad, having an obtuse-angled base, with 
a distinct stalk.
The pinnules are either serrated or lobed, 
and having soft bristles at the apices of the serratures.
The 
fronds are numerous, and placed round the caudex, they are 
spreading and arched, or drooping and bitripinnate.
The pinnse 
numerous and varying in length, sometimes the basal ones are 
longest, but usually they taper towards the base and apex, being 
narrow linear -lanceolate in form.
The pinnules ovate-falcate, 
having a bold anterior projecting flat lobe.
Usually profoundly 
serrate, each serrature ending in a slender but rigid bristle.
The basal anterior pinnule is frequently much larger than the 
rest.
Profoundly pinnatifid, and occasionally even pinnate.
Veins furcately-branched and alternate, from a flexuous mid-

There are many varieties of this lovely Fern, now to be 
described: —

(Fig. 45.) — An interesting and distinct

My 
obligations are due to Mr. Wollaston, of Chisselhurst, and 
Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, for fronds.
This Fern 
approaches the normal form of Polystichum aculeatum.

The pinnules are large 
and broad and inciso-serrate ; all but the anterior lobe biserrate 
and aristate.

As its name implies, 
78

it is hiserrate.
It has been found in Jersey by Mr. Jackson, 
and at Brentford by Mr. S.

Fronds have been for- 
warded to me both from Mr. Sim, of Foot's Cray Nursery, 
Kent, and Mr. Stansfield, of Todmorden.

Trtpinxatum, Moore.
(Plate XIV.) — A most lovely variety, 
found accidentally in Cornwall, and brought into notice by 
myself, having been received as a seedling in a batch of the 
ordinary form from Mr. H.
T. Millett, of Penzance.
It ^is 
described in Mr. Moore's "Nature Printed Ferns," and figured 
in Table xiii, b, also in his "Handbook of British Ferns," 
page 90, and a coloured illustration given in my "Natural 
History of British and Exotic Ferns," (under the name of 
Aspidium angulare, var.
tripinnatum,) plate XXIV, vol.
vi, 
page 70.
Although grown in my Fernery for the last ten 
years, it has never increased in size, and this plant I believe 
is the only one in existence.
In a growing state there is one 
peculiarity, namely, the pinnse lie nearly horizontally one above 
another, like so many steps of a ladder; and, being crowded 
together, when a frond is pressed flat for preservation as a 
dried specimen, the pinnse overlap each other.
It is exceedingly 
chaffy beneath, and a most distinct variety.
There is a variety in Messrs.
Stansfield's collection bearing 
the same name, but very distinct from this form, and not 
nearly so handsome.
The true form is stout and rigid, having

crowded imbricated pinnules.
Mr.
^loore remarks that its 
chief peculiarity consists in the anterior basal pinnule being 
very much larger than the others, nearly twice as large as the 
rest, and in being distinctly pinnate nearly its whole length, 
the little pinnulets being stalked.
It is profuse in the pro- 
duction of sori, and a marked aberration from the normal form.
The colour is a Aivid green.
The rachis and stipes very scaly, 
and the habit peculiar, the fronds rising perpendicularly.
The 
plant is unfortunately placed, as large fronds of the Osmunda 
regalis weep over it, and somewhat obstruct its growth and 
conceal it from view.
This very beautiful variety has been 
called Tripinnatum in contrast with the Suhtripinnatum, in

It is tripinnate, 
(having distinct pinnae, pinnules, and pinnulets.) The pinnulets 
are lobed, and the lobes themselves serrated.
The pinnae re- 
semble those of Polystichum aculeatiOn, but are diminutive in 
size.
It resembles Suhtripinnattim, but is more divided.

Lancashire, by Mr. Stansfield.
A distinct and pretty Fern, of 
slender habit, and having the pinnae less crowded than is usual 
with Polystichum angulare.
Its chief distinction consists in the 
bristly points of the serratures being more developed than usual, 
and tui'ning upwards, the long hair-like points giving the plant 
a bristly appearance.
The stipes is also proliferous.
The frond 
illustrated is from Mr. Wollaston's plant.

of this very handsome Fern : one found at Wimbledon, by Mr.
Choules; and another, a more elegant variety, near Ottery St.
Mary, in Devonshire, by Mr. WoUaston: the latter is a sub- 
variety, known in gardens as Polystichum angulare, var.

It is of lax habit, and very graceful in its growth, 
having narrowed, attenuated, semi-depauperated (but not dis- 
torted) tripinnatc pinnules, which are distantly lobed, profoundly

divided, and conspicuously stalked; the segments are occasionally 
perfectly and widely divided, so as to form a tripinnate frond.
The former variety is still more singular, having exceedingly 
narrow, acute pinnides.
Both these varieties are viviparous in the axils of the lower 
pinns, and occasionally in the axils of the pinnules, and from 
this cause very easily propagated, and hecome widely spread 
in collections.
Both varieties are more distinctly stalked than 
I in the normal forms of Polystichum angulare.
I am indebted 
to Messrs.
Veitch, of the Exotic Nurseries, Chelsea, and to 
Mr. Monkman, of Maltou, and ]Mr. Stansfield, of Todmorden, 
for plants of this variety.
Cristatum, Moore.
(Plate XVI.) — An exceedingly beautiful 
Fern, resembling in its general features the lovely crested 
varieties of Lastrea filix-mas and Athyrium Jilix-foemina.
It 
was first discovered near Bristol by Mr. HiUman, a working 
collector of Ferns, who travels throughout the British Isles in 
pursuit of Ferns, walking from place to place, with a huge 
basket slung on his back.
Mr. Hillman disposed of his plant 
to Messrs.
Garaway, ^Mayes, and Co. Subsequently it has been 
found in Devonshire by the Rev. T.
M. Chanter, and by Mr.
WoUaston; and again in Somersetsliire by Mr. Elworthy.
The 
latter gentleman found two varieties, both well-developed forms, 
one of which is now in the possession of Mr. Veitch, of 
Chelsea.
It has been found in various degrees of development.
In general outline it closely resembles the normal form, but 
the apex of the frond, and the apices of the pinnse branch 
out into multifid curly tufts, those of the pinnae being mucli 
less developed than those of the frond.
My thanks are due 
to Mr. Monkman, of Malton, for plants; and to Messrs.
Sim, 
of Foot's Cray, Stansfield, of Todmorden, and Mr. Wollaston, 
of Chisselhurst, for fronds.

The frond 
terminates abruptly.
The pinnae are short, with from three to 
four pairs of pinnules, terminating with a fan-shaped pinnule, 
the remainder of the pinnules being palmately lobed and deeply 
toothed.
Veins ramose; venules simple or furcate.

The coriaceous 
textui'e of the fronds, and their abrupt termination, as well as

ribs remaining, and even these irregularly developed.
Some 
fronds are less affected than others, and in these the pinnules 
are cuneate at the base, and above are serrated with lengthy 
subulate teeth.

The pinnules crowded, blunt, rounded-oblong in 
shape, imbricated, and not much narrowed at the apex.

nulose-serrated; the anterior base sub-auricled; the basal anterior 
pinnule much larger, and all the pinnules united with the rachis 
by a brief, almost-winged petiole.
The stipes and basal portion 
of the rachis proliferous, a bulbil being found on the larger 
fronds beneath the soil, so that each large frond is accom- 
panied by a small one.
Remarkable for its narrow imbricated 
fronds.
Mr. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst, Mr. Sim, of Foot's

Monkman, of Malton, and Messrs.
Stansfield, of 
Todmorden, have each forwarded excellent fronds.

AcuLEATOTDES, Wollaston.
(Fig. 51.) — This variety of Poly- 
stichum angulare closely resembles the Polystichum aculeatiim 
in some respects, and may be regarded as a variety that connects 
more or less the two species.
It was found in Devonshire, in 
the year 1860, by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst.
This 
aculeatum-\oo\im^ Fern has lanceolate and somewhat acuminate 
fronds.
The pinnules decurrent, set on the pinnae with a broad 
footstalk, as in the species Polystichum aculeatum.
The frond 
illustrated was procured from Mr. Wollaston.

Grandidens, Moore.
(Fig. 52.) — The present very interesting 
and distinct variety was found in Devonshire by Mr. E,.
Penwell, and brought under notice by Mr. Hodges, of Chel- 
tenham.
This is another of those dwarfish forms of Polystichum 
angiilare, having narrow lanceolate fronds.
In a species so 
subject to variety as the present Polystichum, there are varieties 
which run into each other and mingle their several peculiarities, 
in a manner that makes it difficult to determine to which 
these varieties should belong: these of course are not distinct 
enough to warrant being figured and described.
Sub-varieties 
of certain forms are numerovis, as, for instance, those of the 
variety CHstatum; and, although there is occasionally a 
marked difference between them, nevertheless there is not 
sufficient distinction, and therefore they are passed over with 
merely a remark.
Another class of varieties are also discarded.
86 
POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
I allude to the non-permanent varieties — those that depart from 
the ordinary normal form, and at length return again to it; 
these also are very numerous.
Some varieties only assume their 
distinctive character when growing wild, under cultivation 
returning to the normal form ; whilst others, after being removed, 
return to the normal form until perfectly established in their 
new situations, and then again shew their true character.
There 
are, therefore, great difficulties to contend with in describing 
the varieties of any species, difficulties, indeed, that are almost 
insurmountable.
The fronds are from twelve to twenty-four 
inches in length, and in most instances terminate abruptly.
The 
pinnae are of various lengths, and generally abrupt.
The 
pinnules small, obliquely-cuneate, and conspicuously and deeply 
in ciso- dentate.
The terminal pinnule of the lower pinna) is 
cuneato-flabcllate and uniform in size with the rest, those of 
the upper pinna) are confluent upwards.
I have received fronds 
from Mr. Sim, of Foot's Cray, and Mr. Stansfield, of Todmorden,

Mr. Wollaston's name is a very appropriate one.
Mr.

variation than as a permanent variety.
Its distinctive feature 
is in having the apex of the frond beautifully tufted, and the 
pinnae sometimes divided.

Conjiuens, the Irish plant, seems to be more d^varf than that 
found in the Channel Islands.
The latter has fronds from two

The form of the fiond is ovate-

The pinnae narrow, interrupted, and alternate; 
they are symmetrically changed, the upper ones to a linear- 
falcate outline, profoundly serrate, and having a very large 
auricle.
The pinnides much depauperated, opposite, or sub-

The entire upper pinnae and the apices of the basal ones are 
confluent and lobate-serrate.
The apex of the frond is lengthened 
and slender, becoming caudate.
Base of frond very scaly.
My 
thanks are due to Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst, for fronds.
A variety of this form under the name of Gracile, (Xo. 2.) 
has been sent to me by Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden.
Athtrioides, Wollaston.— Found, at Barnstaple by Mr. C.
Jackson.
A slender-divided variety, placed provisionally by 
102 
POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
Mr. Moore as a form of Decompositiim.
The pinnules are almost 
linear, profoundly lobed, and having a distinct anterior auricle.
The basal pinnse are the largest, and on these the pinnules on 
the posterior side are considerably larger and more divided 
than is the case with those on the anterior side.
It is un- 
necessary to figure this variety.

CoRYMBiFERUM, Moore.
(Fig. 72.) — Found at Whitby, in 
Yorkshire, by Mr. Willison.
A handsome and constant variety, 
less marked in its peculiarities than Kitsoiiiw, yet having the 
same general character.
It is corymboscly branched at the 
apices of the fronds, but less compoundly so than in KitsonicB.
The lower portion of the frond is almost normal, the pinnules 
being small.
My thanks are due to Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of 
Chiselhurst, for illustrations.
FuRCATUM, Moore.
— Found at Gittisham, near Ottery St.

B. Wollaston; at Barnstaple, in 
the same county, by Mr. H.
F. Dempster; and at Nettlecombe, 
in Somersetshire, by Mr. C.
Elworthy.
A dwarf interesting 
form.
The fronds are nearly normal, the distinction consisting 
in the apex of the frond, or the apices of the pinnae, or of 
both, being forked once or twice beyond the usual acuminated 
or attenuated portion; the lobes in these portions are brief 
and short, and are confined to the extreme tip.
No illustration 
is needed, as a description will suffice.

(Fig. 73.) — Found near Worthing, in 
Sussex, by Mr, G.
B. AVollaston, of Chiselhurst, and also in 
Ireland, by Mr. SwyiLfen Jervis, of Darlaston Hall, Staffordshire.
This interesting dwarf variety is remarkable for its distinct 
acuminate teeth.
The basal anterior pinnules are considerably 
the largest, and almost pinnate.
In some fronds the pinnules are 
more or less cuneate, and their lobes separated by acute open 
sinuses, giving the frond a biserrated appearance.
This, added 
to the prominent and large sjiiny teeth, makes the form 
distinct.

by Dr. Kinahan.
This variety, which is closely allied to 
Proliferum, is exceedingly handsome.
It differs, however, in 
having the segments more crowded, and the apices of the 
pinnules less attenuated.
This large form has broad fronds.
It is abundantly proliferous on the main rachis.
The fronds 
are from twelve to twenty-four inches in length; deltoid 
lanceolate.
Two or three of the basal pairs of pinnae are much 
the largest, and deltoid in shape; the upper pinnae strap- 
shaped.
Pinnules somewhat distant, narrow falcate.
The rachis 
and secondary rachides thickly covered with brown scales.

The 
lowest pair of pinnae are sometimes so large as to take the 
appearance of branches.
The sterile pinnules are obtuse, with 
an obtuse auricle, which is profoundly and acutely serrated.
The fertile pinnules vary from ovate to trapeziform.
The 
anterior basal pinnules are double the size of the others, and 
sometimes doubly auricled.

(Fig. 78.) — A common form, both 
in Ireland and England, scarcely deserving the name of a 
variety, resembling, as it does, the normal form, its only 
difference being in its highly-developed jfronds.
The lower 
pinnules, and the basal ones in particular, are so profoundly 
pinnatifid that the segments become almost distinct, and indeed 
sometimes quite distinct.
It grows in damp shady situations, 
and attains a large size.

pinnules varying in a considerable degree both in form and 
size; at tlie basal portion of tbe frond there are a few divided, 
as in Suhtripinnatum, but as they approach the apex they 
become less and less divided.
The pinnules are incised in 
various ways, and are irregularly laciniated, and occasionally 
depauperated; the segments are serrated, and the basal anterior 
ones auricled.
A smaller variety has been found in Sussex, 
by Dr. AUchin: it differs in occasionally having the epidermis 
on some of the pinnules disrupted.
Examples have been 
furnished by Mr. G.

It is dwarf in habit, and exceedingly narrow.
Mr.
Moore says that in the frond he measured, which was eight 
inches long, exclusive of the stipes, it was barely more than 
an inch in width.
The fronds are narrow linear-lanceolate, 
being attenuated at their apices; bipinnate.
The pinnules are 
normal in character, small and crowded together, auricled, and

In^quale, Moore.
(Fig. 82.) — Found in Devonshire, by 
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston.
A pretty abnormal Fern.
The form of 
the frond is lance-shaped, the basal pinntc being short.
The 
pinnules are various in size and form, and in the upper 
portion more especially they are misshapen, and more or less 
depauperated.
Most of the pinnules are oblong-ovate, being 
rounded at their apices, having the usual terminal awn and 
anterior basal auricle.
This variety is of an average size, and 
is fertile towards the apex.
The distinctive feature of the 
variety is the irregularity of the size and form of the pinnules.
Examples of Incequale have been furnished by Mr. G.

A most curious form, 
having on the lower pinnae unequally, inciso-lobate, and varying 
pinnules, of which the basal anterior lobe (aui'icle) is considerably 
increased in size, and widely detached from the others, the 
remainder forming lacerate serratures, all the larger of which 
are again serrated.
The upper pinnse are fertile, and somewhat 
depauperated, being very irregular in size, outline, and toothing.
For fronds I am indebted to Mr. R.

by the discoverer to be a new species.
The fronds are dark 
in colour, firm in substance, and lanceolate in form, having 
the apex attenuated.
Pinnules ovate-falcate, somewhat convex, 
bluntly auricled, and indistinctly serrated.
Stipes long.
The 
form is pretty, and the aspect is that of a slender form of 
Polystichum aculeatum.
My thanks are due to Mr. Wollaston, 
of Chiselhurst, for fronds.
Curium, Moore, {Semitripinnatum, Moore.) — Found near 
Nettlecombe, Somersetshire, by Mr. Elworthy.
A pretty and 
curious dwarf Decompositum-looking Fern, with short triangular 
fronds of from six to eight inches in length, and five inches 
in width at the base.
The pinnae, which are crowded and 
alternate, are somewhat irregular.
The pinnules overlap each 
other, and when least developed are like JBiserratum; the more 
developed ones are more or less pinnatifid, when they somewhat 
resemble Plumosum.
The upper half of the frond soriferous.
The posterior pinnules of the basal i)air of pinnse are enlarged, 
being pinnate at the base, and profoundly pinnatifid upwards, 
giving the plant a character and resemblance of Lastrea

The fronds, which are very large, and of a pale green colour, 
are broad, ha^T.ng an ovate-lanceolate outline.
Bipinnate, and 
almost tripinuate in the most di^-ided parts.
Texture thin and 
dry.
Pinnae broad and ample.
Pinnules long-stalked, pro- 
foundly inciso-lobate, giving an elegant feathery appearance to 
the graceful arching fronds; hence the name Plumosum.
The 
basal anterior lobe of the pinnules is large, having the ordinary 
auricle lobed on the margin, or biserrate, with sharp teeth.
The others are profoundly incised, each lobe pointing forwards, 
and again cut into sharp-pointed teeth.
Rachis of the pinnae 
very slender.
Length of frond from two to three feet.

PoLYDACTYLUM, Moore.
CFig. 86.^ — Found in Tipperary in 
1857, and introduced into public notice by Mr. R.
Sim, of 
Foot's Cray.
An exceedingly elegant and constant variety, 
having slender narrow lance-shaped fronds.
The pinnae brief and 
somewhat irregular, and the pinnules here and there abortive 
or depauperated, yet not to an extent to interfere with the 
general outline of the frond.
The pinnules are small, with a 
very distinct stalk and auricle.
The distinctive feature of this 
form is the branching of the pinnse, which become ramose at 
about half their length, the branches of which are divergent, 
but plane, and formed of pinnules that are more or less con- 
fluent.
It is analogous to the many -fingered variety of Athyriuni 
jiUx-fcemina.
Length from eight to twelve inches.

Hall.
It is very similar in outline and general appearance 
to the variety Pohjdactylum of Moore, and is equally large, 
and as elegant a variety.
The distinction consists in the 
apices of the fronds terminating in a horn.
It is not necessary 
to give an illustration of this variety.

Occasionally 
the upper pinnae are partially depauperated.
More dwarf than 
Prcemorsum, and narrow, being about nine inches long and 
two inches broad.
The apex of the frond alone fertile, and 
even there only two or three pairs of sori at the tip of the 
pinnae, and a single row at the acuminate apex of the frond.

The apex of the frond attenuated, and similarly affected.
Stipes and rachis covered with reddish scales.
The lower 
pinnaj normal, and having blunt small pinnules.
A handsome 
form has been found within the last few days, near Lympstone, 
by Mr. E..
J. Gray, of Alphington, near Exeter.
Its remarkable 
character extends through the whole frond; the pinnaj are 
short, somewhat distant, and opposite; the pinnules distinctly 
stalked, three or four pairs with an ultimate one; the superior 
basal pinnules somewhat rotund, the others cup-shaped; the 
ultimate one very large, dentate, very spiny, somewhat circular, 
and expanded to such dimension as to be wider than any 
other portion of the pinna; the cup-shaped pinnules are also 
spiny.
I have preferred retaining this form with Congestum 
at present, giving it the provisional name of Cupid if or me, on 
account of the little cup-like pinnules.
I am indebted to the 
Eev. Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall, Nottinghamshire, for 
the original form, and to Mr. R.
J. Gray, of Alphington, near 
Exeter, for Cupuliforme, (Fig. 95.) Of the former I have

Found at Torquay, in Devonshire, in 1856, by Miss Annie 
Kitson, of Shiphay, Torquay, and brouglit under notice by Mr.
K. J.
Gray, of Exeter.
A very distinct, and perhaps the most 
beautiful variety of Polystichum angulare, and quite constant 
under cultivation.
The rachis of the fronds divides towards 
the apex into four or five branches, the branches themselves 
being tufted corymbosely, whilst the pinnae which form them 
spread out and become crispy at their apices.
The basal pinnse 
are normal, having numerous pinnules, which are oblong-acute 
in form, setaceo-serrate on their edges, and not so much 
auriculate as is usual in this species; the confluent apices of 
the pinnae having a disposition to become dilatate.
Near the 
apex of the frond there is an xmusually large tuft, formed by 
the branches, and here both the pinnae and pinnules arc 
altered in a greater or less degree; usually they are smaller 
in size and more generally confluent than in the lower pinnae; 
there is, however, the same setaceous dentation throughout.
The upper pinnae have their extreme points widened out into 
crispy tufts.
My thanks are due to Mr. R.
J. Gray, of 
Alphington, near Exeter, and to Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of 
Darlaston Hall, for fronds.
Mr. SwjTifen Jervis possesses the 
original specimen of this splendid variety.

A most lovely and graceful Fern.
It is of the 
same normal form as Gracile, another species found in Devon- 
shire, by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, and described at page 101, but 
differs in being crested.
A much-cut variety, with ovate- 
attenuate bipinnate fronds.
Pinnules small, narrow, oblong- 
acute, and hardly-auricled, variable in form, and some linear; 
having an inciso-scrrate margin.
The apices of the fronds, as 
well as those of the pinnte and pinnules, are crested.
Mr.
Gray's form of this variety is a very good one.
It is about 
tAvelve inches in length, and only two inches and a half wide 
in the widest part, and the apices of all the pinnule's are 
semi-transparent, owing to the green epidermis not extending 
to their extreme ends, and being very conspicuous from their 
unusual breadth.

POLYSTICIIUM ANGULARE.
Frond ovate-acuminate; as in Linsare, the pinnules being narrow, 
interrupted, and alternate; much depauperated and very 
various in size and shape.
The difference between the present 
form and Lineare consists in it being rigid, proliferous, and in 
being much more linear near the rachis of the frond.
The 
three or four pairs of pinnules next the rachis on each pinna) 
are almost or quite wanting, except the midvein, which remains 
as a spine, the next one or two pairs as a forked spine, beyond 
which are small pinnules with cuneate bases, the pinnules 
becoming larger and more perfect the further they are removed 
from the base of the pinnae.
The superior basal pinnule is 
very long but linear, sometimes however only represented by 
a spine.
Rachis and stipes very scaly.
My thanks are due to 
the Rev. Charles Padlcy for fronds.

Devonshire, by Mr. George B.
Wollaston, of Chiselhurst, and 
subsequently at Barnstaple, by Mr. Jackson.
Although un- 
doubtedly distinct, it is one of the forms of Proliferum, and 
has been thought to be a variety deserving a figure.

The length of the pinnae are — basal one inch, 
second and third two inches, fourth three inches, sixth to 
twelfth two inches and a half to one inch and a half, 
thirteenth to twenty-second one inch and a half to half an 
inch, the remainder varying from nothing to half an inch.
In 
the lower half of the frond the pinnules are, wuth very few 
exceptions, all equal in size, all of them distinctly stalked, 
except the extreme apex; broad, somewhat ovate, crenate, and 
distinctly spinose, indistinctly auricled, except the basal pinnules.
The superior basal pinnule lobed on either side, the lobe 
occasionally distinctly stalked, and almost circular in from.
The apices of the pinnae end bluntly and abruptly, the apical 
pinnule frequently larger than the other pinnules.
In the 
upper half of the frond the pinnules are much smaller, laciniated, 
very dissimilar, occasionally quite linear; many are triangular, 
and most have a cuneate base.
The number of pinnules on each 
pinna varies from none or one to eight; mostly three, whilst 
those on the basal portion vary from eight to fifteen.

frond upwards.
The edges of the pinnules are minutely ser- 
rated; they are devoid of spines, except a solitary one at the 
rounded apex, and also at the apex of the auricle.
The upper 
third of the frond differs considerably, the pinnules being much 
smaller and narrower as they approach the apex, at length 
becoming linear.
The apex of the frond is an axact Linearc.

both above and below, with larger basal pinnules, the superior 
basal one distinctly tiipinnate, the basal pair of lobes being 
stalked.
Coarsely dentate, and destitute of spines.
In the 
centre of the frond the auricle both above and below is divided 
to the base and stalked, being parallel to the rachides, simple, 
entire, and elongate-ovate.
Stipes, rachis, and rachides covered 
with narrow, hair-like, pale brown scales, giving the stems a 
woolly appearance.
The stipes and the basal portion of the 
rachis scattered over with broad, thick, sharp-pointed scales, 
almost black, and ebeneous, having a narrow red line along 
each edge.
The under side of every pinnule, from the extreme 
basal pinnae to the apex of the frond, profusely covered with 
large spore- cases, averaging from seven to eleven on each 
pinnule, the indusium being circular, pale in colour, with a 
dark centre.
The texture of the pinnae thick, and the veins 
invisible from the opaqueness of the pinnules.
This Fern has 
a very foreign look about it, and were it not for the authority 
I should have been inclined to have considered it from the 
Cape of Good Hope.
The name has been given in reference 
to the spore-cases covering every pinnule.

PoLUEiDES, Lowe.
(Fig. 120.) — Found near Exeter, by the 
Rev. Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall, Xottinghamshiie.
This 
is a handsome large-growing Fern, which sometimes bends round 
in a remarkable manner.
The length of the frond is about 
thirty-eight inches.
About eight inches from the apex it becomes 
branched, and one of the branches again branched, the latter 
being much shorter than the others.
This may be con- 
sidered as one of the forms of the variety JMulliJidum, but 
having characters sufiiciently distinct to warrant its being named.
The stem is very scaly quite to the apex of the frond.
The 
pinnaj are everywhere alternate from the base to the apex, and 
they are shorter on one side of the rachis than on the other, 
as the following measurements will shew: — Taking a frond of 
thirty-eight inches in length, at about the height of nine inches 
the pinnjE on the left side are from three inches and a quarter 
to four inches in length, whilst on the right side none exceed 
one inch and a half.
At eighteen inches in height the pinnse 
become more equal in length, but are yet shorter on the right 
side.
The pinnae are remote, long, narrow, and acuminate at 
142 
POLYSTTCnUM AXGUI.AKK.
their apices.
There arc about twenty-eight pairs of pinna?
to 
the point of branching, the branches themselves containing 
about twenty-five additional pairs.
The pinnules are sub-opposite 
below and alternate above, convex behind and concave in front, 
they are also auricled.
In the basal pinna?
the pinnules are 
broader and closer together, those on the right side even over- 
lapping each other.

In the basal portion of the frond 
the pinna; are long, and crowded together, their apices more 
or less linear.
In the middle portion of the frond the pinnae 
are interrupted, being reduced to a long narrow lobe.
The 
pinnules on the basal pair of pinna) are much larger than the 
others, and the inferior and superior pinnules are very similar 
in size; these pinnules are long and narrow, with almost rounded 
apices, having a deeply-divided auricle, which is almost wanting 
on the other pinna?, except near the apex of the frond.
These 
pinnules are somewhat triangular in form, having a cuneate base, 
and here the lobe becomes a marked feature, being itself more 
or less deeply cut and densely spiny; the whole of the pinnules 
are densely spiny.
Stipes and rachis scaly.

vided, it is however never so divided as in Angustifrons.
The pinnfc are alternate, and in the lower half of the frond 
much bended.
Tripinnate.
The pinnules large, auriculato, 
deeply divided, especially towards the base, and more especially 
the auricle, which is divided to the veinlet, serrated, and very 
spiny, the superior basal one is the longest, and its basal lobes 
are distinctly stalked as in Tripinnatum.
The chief features 
in this form are its very fragile texture, its bending pinnae and 
its large spines, more especially shewn in the centre of the 
frond.
Colour a dark bluish green.
Stipes, rachis, and rachidcs 
very scaly.
My thanks are due to the Hev. Charles Padlcy, 
of Bui well Hall, Nottinghamshire, for fronds.
SuB-VAiiiEGATUM, Wullaston.
— Perfectly normal in every 
respect, except that it is beautifully mottled with cream-colour 
and pale green, a character which, like many of the goldcn- 
foliaged trees in our gardens, disappears in autumn, to return 
again with the new fronds or leaves, as the case may be, next 
spring.
Found by Mr. G.

Grandiceps, WoUasto7}.
(Fig. 128.) — The history of this 
Fern is obscure, and all that is known about Grafniiceps is that 
Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darhxston HaU, Staffordshire, is in pos- 
session of the only plant in existence, and that it is one of 
the handsomest forms of Polystichiun angulare yet discovered, 
bearing a strong resemblance to Polystichum aculeatum variety 
lohatum-corymhifcrum of ^loore, and very like a crested lobate 
form of P.
aculeatum in general appearance.
Length of frond 
twelve inches, width (except at the apex) from one and a half 
to two inches; at the apex the frond branches, and these branches 
are again divided and subdivided, their extreme apices being 
cristate and fan-shaped, forming a circular head of about four 
inches and a half across.

Elwoutiiii, Moore, {Cruciatum, AYollaston.) (Fig. 131.) — • 
A remarkably distinct variety, found near Ncttlecombe, by Mr.
Charles Elworthy, gardener to Sir C.
Trevcllyn, of Nettlecombe, 
and subsequently witliia a few miles of the same place by Mr.
George B.
Wollaston, of Chiselhurst.
This is an exceedingly 
handsome form, with long and very narrow fronds, being strikingly 
different from all other varieties.
It is at present very rare, 
indeed I am not aware that it is in the Ferneries of any of 
our cultivators, except those of the two discoverers, and in that 
of Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston Hall.
Being unaware 
whether ^Mr.
^loore's name or Mr. Wollaston's should take pre- 
cedence, or whether they are both names in manuscript only, 
and as the Fern is so remarkable, that it is well worthy of 
bearing the name of EhcortJdi, after the discoverer Mr. Elworthy, 
I have adopted Mr. Moore's name.
From the well-known fame 
of this cultivator of the British Ferns, as a most successful dis- 
coverer of many distinct varieties of the British species, Mr.
Elworthy's name is most deservedly worthy of being handed 
down to future generations in connection with this plant.
I 
have been somewhat inclined to look upon Elicorthii and Cru- 
ciafum as distinct varieties, but from the conflicting evidence 
that has been received on the subject, I have refrained from 
154 POr.YSTICTIUM ANGULARE, 
separating tlicm.
However Mr. Elworthy says that this plant 
has all the fronds furcate, giving a very singular appearance; 
Mr. Wollaston, on the contrary, remarks that he has never seen 
its fronds shewing tendency to be divided at the apex, or to 
branch in the rachls; and Mr. Swynfen Jcrvls, confirming Mr.
Wollaston's observations, says that his plant is not furcate, 
and at the same time a Simon Pure from Mr.
- Elworthy's 
original specimen.
I must therefore conclude that Avhen 
thoroughly established all the plants will resemble Mr. Elworthy's.
Under this present uncertainty I have been additionally induced 
to adopt Elworthii, for if the plants discovered by Mr. Wol- 
laston remain in their present character, the name Cruciatum 
may be applied to them, Avhilst Mr. Elworthy's will retain that 
of Elworthii.
Mr. Wollaston remarks that as Mr. Elworthy's 
plants were found some miles from where he found his, (both, 
however, in Somersetshire,) they may vary.
Length of frond about twenty-two inches, of which the lower 
six inches is occupied by the rachls; frond exceedingly narrow 
at the base, gradually widening to the apex, where it divides 
into two branches, which are flexuous, curling round and 
hanging down; width of frond at base one inch, in the centre 
three inches, and at the apex four inches and a quarter.
The 
four or five basal pairs of pinnae opposite, or sub-opposite, the 
remainder alternate; about seventeen pairs of pinna), becoming 
larger to the apex.
Distinctly stalked, and divided at the base 
close to the rachls into forked pairs of pinme, so as to give the 
appearance of a cruciform arrangement; the upper one ascending 
at a greater or less angle, and the lower one descending at an 
equal angle, the angle being greater towards the base, an 
additional cause of lessening the width of the frond; the basal 
pimiffi however are only three quarters of an inch in length, 
whilst the apical pinna; are three inches and a half in length.
Several of the basal pinmc do not branch at their base into 
two distinct pinmc, and these are bifid at their apices.
The 
pinnae are somewhat distant, but owing to half of them ascending 
and the other half descending, they cross each other at right 
angles, and give the frond a crowded appearance.
The pinnules 
are in the lower half of the frond Imbricate, and in the upper 
half approxinuTte. The lower ones entire, with a serrate, spinous 
edge, and a brief auricle, and briefly stalked; the upper ones 
POLTSTICHUM ANGULARE.
153 
more deeply serrate.
Ilachis and stipes densely scaly.
Sori 
confined to the upper portion of the frond.
The apex has 
every appearance of being proliferous.
Some of the pinnre arc 
even trifidj the third being much smaller in size.
In the plant 
of Mr. Swynfcn Jervis, the fronds are seventeen inches in length, 
width at base one inch^ in centre of frond, in widest part, two 
inches and a quarter, (that is, at four inches from the apex,) 
from which gradually tapering to an acuminate apex.
The 
pinnaj in the upper portion of the frond are not bifid, yet the 
lower portion is so close a copy of Mr. Elworthy's plant, that 
it must be considered at present, with every prospect of the 
assumption being correct, that when the plant has had the growth, 
of another year or two, it will assume the more extraordinary 
characters that constitute tlie differences between this and the 
original plant found by Mr. Elworthy.
My thanks are due to 
Mr. Swynfcn Jervis and to Mr. Elworthy for the fronds now- 
described.
The wood-cut illustration, although quite sufficient 
as far as recognising the plant is concerned, is too small to do 
justice to so beautiful a variety.

This is a large form of 
Biserratum, having the pinnules somewhat depauperated: they 
are also here and there somewhat reduced in size, in an 
irregular manner, and variously misshapen.
Length of frond 
three feet, width six inches in the widest part; equal in 
width, except at the base, where reduced to four inches, and 
at the apex, where attenuated, depauperated, and very variable 
in both width and shape.
The pinna; descend to within three 
inches of the base, there being scarcely any stripes.
Densely 
scaly, some of the scales near the base almost three quarters 
of an inch in length, and approaching half an inch in width; 
colour pale brown, and almost transparent.
Stipes, rachis, 
and rachides very scaly.
Frond long and narrow; pinnae 
alternate, ascending, crowded; pinnules biserrate, large, auricu- 
late, crowded inciso-serrate.
The superior basal pinnule twice 
the length of the others; the basal pair of lobes divided quite 
to the costa, but not stalked, and the next three pairs of lobes 
almost as deeply divided; colour deep rich green.
A fine 
robust Fern, differing chiefly in the incomplete character of 
its pinnae and pinnules near the apex of the frond.
It is 
unnecessary to give an illustration, as it is so closely allied 
to Biserratum.

which are sub-opposite.
The inferior pinnules rather larger 
than the superior ones.
The superior basal pinnule largest, 
having an unequal-sized pair of stalked lobes, above which a 
very deeply-divided lobe or auricle, the remainder of the 
pinnule cut into biserrated or sub-biserrated lobes, surmounted 
with spines that are frequently bended and hooked at their 
apices.
The other pinnules strongly auricled, this lobe being 
divided quite to the base, the other lobes deeply divided.
A 
very distinct and beautiful form.
Sori confined to the upper 
portion of the frond; about seven spore cases on the superior 
basal pinnules, and from four to six on the four large pairs of 
pinnules, and from three to one on the remainder.

The pinna?
in the centre of the frond are three 
inches and a half in length, whilst those near the base are only 
two inches and a half; in the lower portion of the frond the 
pinna3 are horizontal, whilst on the upper half they are ascending, 
and this makes the frond equal in width, although unequal in 
the length of the pinna?.
Pinna?

and auriculate, the apex rounded, but having a single spine in 
the centre; the small ones, which are interspersed irregularly 
amongst the others, are very various in form, mostly cuneate 
at the base, fan-shaped, or irregular, the upper half of the 
firond more irregular.
Sori large, and covering the upper two

spinous than the superior ones, the superior pinnules having 
two and occasionally three spines, and the inferior ones five or 
six.
It grows to a large size, and is more lobate than the 
variety Acutum.
Texture thin.
j\Iy thanks are due to Mr.
C. Ehvorthv, of Nettlecombe, for fronds.
DirrusuM, Lowe.
— Found near Littleham, in North Devon, 
by the Rev. Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall.
This is the best 
lax form I have yet seen.
Very slender, eighteen inches in 
length, and five inches in breadth.
Pinnae lax, long, and 
narrow; opposite below and alternate above.
Pinnules, in basal 
half of frond especially, very distant; in a pinna three inches 
long only three pairs and an ultimate confluent portion; the 
inferior pinnules somewhat longer than the suj^erior ones, very 
long oval in form, entire, serrate, spinous at the apex, and a 
spine where usually the auricular lobe is situated; this spine 
is not at right angles to the lobe, as is usually the case, but 
ascending and almost parallel with the edge of the pinnule.
Somewhat scaly.
iMy thanks arc due to Mr. Padley for fronds.

CoNFLUENS, Moore.
(Fig. 145.) — Found in Ireland by Mr.
S. Foot, of the Irish Geological Siirvey, and near Nettlecombe, in 
Somersetshire, by Mr. Charles Elworthy.
This is much dwarfer 
than Lineare.
Some authorities consider the two forms alike.
Mr. Moore, in his "Nature-Printed Ferns," takes the opposite 
view; he says that Lineare is more decidedly bipinnate, some- 
what lax in habit, the pinnules tolerably perfect in the lower 
half of the frond, linear, and here and there strongly auricled, 
the apex being confluent, linear, and lobate-serrate.
He says 
justly that the upper third of the frond is a representation of 
a whole frond of Covjiaens.
Cotijluens, on the contrary, is 
symmetrical in form, but at the same time semi-depauperated.
Ovate-lanceolate in form, apex attenuated, the lower anterior 
pinnules being alone developed and bij)innate (except an occa- 
sional pinnule;) and this row of pinnules on either side, and 
close to the rachis, gives the plant a singular appearance.
The 
other pinnules more or less linear, seven or eight pairs with a 
confluent apex.
Near the apex of the frond the pinnules are 
entirely confluent and linear-falcate, with a bold anterior auricle 
and a serrated margin.
A variety connecting this with Lineare 
has been found near Exeter, by Mr. J, R.
Gray, and another 
somewhat similar variety, {Lineare proliferum,^ by the Rev. C.
Padley, near Linton, in North Devon.
Conjluens is twelve 
inches in length, of which three inches and a half to four inches 
is the stipes; width two inches and a half.
Stipes, rachis, and 
rachides covered with almost colourless hair-like scales.
My 
thanks are due to Mr. S.
Foot, for fronds.

BuACHiATUM-MULTiFiDUM, Lowe.
— Found near Exmouth, in 
Devonshire, by Mr. 11.
J. Gray, of St. Thomas', Exeter.
An 
interesting variety.
Like Brachiatum, this variety has its lowest 
pair of pinna) very much the largest, and giving the appearance 
of branches; in a frond thirteen inches in length, the basal 
pinna) were four inches and a quarter in length, whilst the 
next pair were only two inches and a half; their width is also 
much greater, the basal ones being in the widest part an inch 
across, whilst the next pair are only half an inch.
With the 
exception of the base the width of the frond is only four inches, 
or only half that of the width across the basal pinna).
The 
pinna) arc various in size, scarcely two alike.
Distinctly tri- 
pinnatc, the two or three basal pinnules on the lowest pinna) 
having at their base a pair of lobes, which are distinctly stalked, 
and of which the lobe next to the rachis is only a fourth of 
the size of the other, the larger lobe being in i'act the auricle, 
and itself auricled.
The pinnules more or less obtuse, (but not 
so much so as in Brachiatum,) except near the apex; various 
in size; nearly all stalked with the exception of the apices of 
POLYSTTCIIUM ANGULARE.

the pinnae, and of the frond.
Pinna} opposite, except near the 
apex and centre of the frond, where alternate.
Near the apex 
pinnre minute, sometimes wanting, the apex branching about 
two inches below the tip, each branch brandling again on the 
superior side into about three branches, and these sub-branches 
again branching, the basal one dilating into a crest at the apex.
As the characters of this Fern are easily describablc, it is 
unnecessary to give an illustration.
Rachis and stipes very 
scaly; pinnules spinose.
For fronds my thanks are due to Mr.
R. J.
Gray, of Exeter.

Ix 1)1 VISUM, Wollaston.
(Fig. 147.) — Found by Mr. Charles 
Elworthy, in Somersetshire, and originally named in MSS.
Biscrratum, but the plant now will not answer to that cognomen.
Frond ovate-lanceolate, with a long stipes.
Pinna; lanceolate, 
the two or three lowest pair refracted.
Pinnules coarse, nearly 
entire, bluntly toothed, simple, undivided, even in the first 
anterior and posterior ones.
I am indebted to Mr. Charles 
Elworthy, of Xettlecombe, Cornwall, for fronds of this variety.
Mr. Padley has forwarded me specimens of a form of this varietv, 
with pinnules above twice the size, making the frond more 
crowded and foliaceous.
It is a more slender plant.
Length 
twenty-one inches; width seven inches in widest part, (that is, 
centre of frond,) scarcely narrowed at the base.
It is more 
spiny.
The plant appears young, and is likely, in course of 
time, to be a much finer variety; should this be the case Indi- 
visum major would be an appropriate name, it is, hoAvever, 
too near the original plant to do more than name provisionally.
BiSERRATUM-DECOMPOSiTUM, Low€.

(Fig. 150.) — Found near 
Nettleconibe by Mr. Charles Elwortliy, and named by him 
Iripinnatum, from its truly tripinnate character; it is, however, 
a very distinct form of Decompositum.
Length above three 
feet, width nine inches; colour rich green; lanceolate and 
tripinnate.
Pinnw opposite on lower half of frond, alternate 
above, lanceolate, distant in the four basal pairs of pinna.^, 
the next ten pairs approximate, and the remainder crowded.
Pinnules in the basal tlirce or four pairs of pinnte much

Pinnules very irregular.
The superior basal 
pinnule longest, the lobes of it divided to the costa, the other 
pinnules varying much in size and shape, all very strongly

Decompositum-Elworthii, Lowe.
— A most lovely form of 
Decompositum, found near Nettlecombe by Mr. C.

The pinnae 
in lower half of frond opposite, in upper half alternate; they 
commence quite at the base, lea\ang no stipes.
Colour of 
fronds vivid green.
Pinnee and pinnules crowded, the latter 
deeply cut, very hirsute, and the sori on every pinnule, even 
to the basal pinnae.

fronds.
Pulchrum-irregulare, Sim, MSS.
— A handsome variety 
found near Nettlecombe by Mr. Charles Elworthy.
Length of 
frond above two feet, width from six to eight inches, the apex 
ending abruptly and irregularly.
Pinnae opposite on the lower 
half and alternate on the upper half of the frond.
Stipes 
and rachis very stout and densely scaly, deeply fluted.

long, narrow, and acuminate, five inches in length, except the 
upper six inches, where from two inches to less than an inch, 
the smaller pinnae almost as broad as the others.
Pinnules 
stalked almost to the apex of the pinnae; the lower ones some- 
what larger than the superior ones, deeply cut, strongly auricled, 
the auricle divided to the base, sharply dentate.
The upper 
pinnules not auriculate, and undivided.
The fronds I have 
seen of this variety are not sufficiently irregular to warrant 
its name; it is, however, a very pretty form.
My thanks are 
due to Mr. Charles Elworthy, of Xcttlecombc, for fronds.
176 POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
Parvulum, Loioe.
— This is a very small fronded variety, 
found in Devonshire by the late Mr. Charles Jackson, of 
Barnstaple.
It is a variety that was very much esteemed by 
Mr. Jackson, and is now in the possession of the llcv.
Charles 
Padley, of Bulwell Hall.
The length of the frond is only 
eight inches, and the width, (which is almost equal, except 
towards the rapidly-tapering end) barely two inches and a half.
Pinnffi about twenty-three pairs, sub-opposite below and alternate 
above, crowded except at the base, the basal pair narrower 
than the others.
Pinnules about eight or nine pairs, and an 
ultimate elongated pinnule; narrow, the basal ones stalked, 
entire, having a small spiny auricle, and a pointed spiny apex.
Stipes and rachis scaly.
Colour grassy green.
Sori diminutive 
and costal, confined to the upper two inches of the frond, and 
only six or eight spore, cases on each pinna.
The superior basal 
pinnule longest.
My thanks are due to the Rev. Charles Jackson 
for fronds.
ExTREMUM, Lowe.
— Found in Devonshire last spring by 
Mr. Charles Elworthy, of Nettlecombe.
It is a very handsome 
form, more closely allied to Ohtusissimum than any other 
variety; it is however more attenuated and narrower.
The 
pinnae are crowded so as to touch each other from the centre 
of the frond upwards, and nearly so on the lower half of the 
frond, but not to overlap, as is the case with Obtusissimum ; 
the pinnules are also smaller in size, and oval in form, and 
much more serrated, the spines minute, and not so distinctly 
stalked.
Length twelve to fourteen inches, width three inches.
Colour a vivid grassy green.
The sori are situated only near the 
apex of the pinnae, and the basal two thirds of the pinnae being 
destitute of spore-cases, the frond seems as if belted with a 
marginal band, and on this account the name of Extremum has 
been selected to mark the position of the sori.
My thanks are 
due to Mr. Elworthy for fronds.
Proliferum-angustatum, Stansfield MSS.
— Raised at the 
Vale Gardens, Todmorden, near Manchester, by the Messrs.
Stansfield.
Fronds from one to two feet long, and only two 
inches broad.
Bipinnate; pinnae short and obtuse; pinnules 
POLYSTICHUM AXOrLAKE, 177 
deltoid, sliglitly auricled, only occasionally proliferous in the 
lower part of the rachis.
This form differs from the old Pro- 
liferum in the frond being much narrower and much less 
proliferous.
I am indebted to ^lessrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, 
for fronds.
Arctatum, 31oore.
— Found at Barnstaple, by the late Mr.
C. Jacjvson.
A handsome and large variety, bearing somewhat 
the resemblance of Lineare, but being, however, less abnormal 
in its development.
The pinnules are tolerably uniform; seldom 
depauperated.
The pinnae are also not confluent into a lengthy 
linear lobe, but diminishing in the ordinary manner.
The 
pinnules are almost linear, acute, having a very large acute 
anterior auricle.
Xear the base of the frond they are somewhat 
more oblong, yet even here narrow.

A brief-pinnuled, but profoundly 
lobed form.
Variabile, Moore.
— Found at Barnstaple, Devonshire, by 
Mr. C.
Jackson.
A Fern of large size, having ramose pinna^.
The distinctive feature of this variety is the very unequal 
branching of the pinna;; some are divided near their base, 
others only at the apex; then again others are unbranched, 
and others are abbreviated (whether branched or unbranched.) 
Some of the pinnules are depauperated, and others normal; 
the latter are larger, acute, and dentate, as in the variety 
Biserratum, 
Pyramidale, Moore.
— Found several years ago at Nettle- 
combe, in Somersetshire, by Mr. Elworthy.
A well-marked 
variety, having the base of the frond broadest, and having a 
pyramidal or elongate-triangular outline.
The fronds (exclusive 
of the stipes) exceed tAvelve inches in length.
The pinna?, 
which are dense, aie five inches in length in the basal pair, 
and four inches in length in the second pair.
The pinnules 
are oblique and stalked, the basal ones being profoundly jiin- 
natifid, with ovate-toothed lobes.
The upper portion of the 
pinnules is biserrate, and the teeth acute.
Calcaeatum, WoUastoti.
— Found in Devonshire, by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston.
This variety is an interrupted form of dwarf 
habit.
The small pinnules, where perfectly formed, have 
coarse, lengthy, spiny serratures.
Towards the apex of the 
frond the pinnaj arc irregularly abbreviated, and their pinnules 
irregularly depauperated.
The main rachis is also arrested, 
and is in the form of a small horn or spur amongst the 
misshapen pinnse.
PrtEMORSO-pulchrum, Moore.
— Found at Nettlccombe, by 
Mr. Elworthy.
A pretty variety, having intermediate characters 
between Pulchrum and Prcemorsitm.
It is a dwarf form, Avith 
small pinnules.
In the lower portion of the frond the pinnules 
are inciso-lobate, with serrated lobes, whilst towards the apex 
they are decurrent, and misshapen in a greater or less degree, 
forming irregular and more or less confluent pinnae.
POLYSTICHUM ANGCLARE.

AcuLEATOiDES-CBiSTATUM, Wolliiston.
f Polystichum aculea- 
tum-cristatum.
J — From the collection of the late Mr. Charles 
Jackson, of Barnstaple, and now in the possession of the Rev.
Charles Padley, of Bulwell HaU.
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston informs 
me that this plant has been known for some years, and was found 
in Devonshire, by Mr. Dempster, and taken to Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Moore supposed at the time that it was a variety of Poly- 
stichum actdeatum, which he named Cristatum.
It is however, 
no doubt, a variety of Polystichum angular e, therefore Mr.
Wollaston has re-named it.
A long narrow^-fronded form, about 
eighteen inches in length, with opposite or sub-opposite pinnae, 
lanceolate or linear-lanceolate in form, the apex indistinctly 
cristate.
Pinnules entire, small, a lengthened oval, aculeate, 
scarcely auricled, a strong spine takuig the place of the auricle.
Stipes and rachis sparingly covered with hair-like scales.
I am 
indebted to the E,ev.
C. Padley, of Bulwell Hall, for fronds.
The variety differs from Aculeatoides in having longer and 
narrower pinnae, in being somewhat cristate, the pinnules being 
wider apart, and more aculeate.
Decompositum-multifidum, Lowe.
— A multifid form of 
Decompositum, found in Devonshire by the Rev. F.
Mules, of 
Marwood.
Fronds large, three feet six inches in length, 
lanceolate in form, and eight inches wide.
Three or four 
inches below the apex branching into three branches, these 
again branching; their apices furcate, the furcations being 
cristate.
Stipes thick, twelve to fourteen inches in length; 
scaly.
Rachis scaly; rachides scaly.
The three pairs of basal 
pinnae remote, the rest approximate, the basal pair shorter 
than the others; all approximate.
The inferior pinnules 
somewhat larger than the rest, stalked almost to the apices of 
the pinnae, long, blunt-pointed, deeply lobed, and strongly 
auriculate.
In the centre of the frond pinnules more deeply 
cut, the basal lobes divided to the costa, and the superior 
basal pinnules larger than the others, densely but minutely 
spinous.
My thanks are due to the Rev. F.
Mules for fronds.
Semitripinnatum, Moore.
— A not uncommon large-growing 
variety, two feet or more in length, and six or seven inches 
broad.
Almost tripinnate.

The inferior pinnules, especially of the basal pair of 
pinnae, longest, and the superior basal pinnule twice the length 
of the remainder, conspicuously auricled, the auricle of the 
superior basal pinnule distinctly stalked.
My thanks are due 
to Mr. G.
B. WoUaston, of Chiselhurst; Mr. C.
Elworthy, of 
Nettlecombe; Mr, Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston Hall; the 
Rev. Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall; the Rev. F.
Mules, 
of Marvvood; Mr. Daniels, of Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire;

deemed unnecessary to give an illustration, since then I have 
thought it advisable to refer again to the variety, and to have 
a wood-cut illustration executed, thinking that without one there 
-would be a great chance of those who are not quite conversant

Abruptum, Stansfield, MSS.
— Mr. Stansfield infonns me 
that this variety has almost lost its distinctive character, and 
is scarcely worth its name.
It has merged into the form 
Prcemorsum.
The variety has been included here, as it is 
known in cultivation; the mention of it must therefore be 
looked upon as pointing out that it no longer deserves to 
be retained amongst the distinct varieties of Polystichum 
angulare.

by Mr. Thomas Moore, of Chelsea, under the name of Quad- 
ratum, but the description in his octavo edition of "Nature 
Printed British Ferns," vol.
i, page 144, is not sufficiently 
characteristic, and as the pinnules cannot be considered as in 
the least degree quadrate, Mr. Wollaston, taking the remarkably 
setose feature of the pinnules, has re-named it most appro- 
priately Setosum.
This variety has lanceolate bipinnate fronds, 
and linear -lanceolate pinnse.
The pinnules remarkably setose, 
constricted, and wavy.
I have received fronds from Mr. C.
Elworthy, of Nettlecombe, twenty-six inches long, by four 
inches wide in the widest part, with the pinnae ascending at 
an angle of forty-five degrees.
See page 97, under Quadratum, 
Moore.
Brachiatum, Wollaston.
— Very handsome and distinct, 
having a light elegant appearance.
Colour of frond yellowish 
green above, rust-coloured beneath, from the sori.
Length 
of frond eighteen inches, width four inches.
Pinna?
crowded, 
narrow, and acuminate, varying in length in different portions 
of the frond, so as to cause a curiously-shaped frond, narrower

in the centre than at the base, and at a third below the apex, 
the apex itself ending abruptly.
Length of pinnee — two 
inches below the apex as much as one inch and a half in 
length, one inch below the apex only three quarters of an 
inch, three inches below apex one inch and three quarters 
long, four inches below apex two inches and a half long, six 
inches below two inches and a quarter long, seven inches from 
apex two inclies long, ten inches from apex one inch and a 
half long, eleven inches from apex two inches and a half long, 
twelve inches from apex thi'ee inches long; basal pair of pinnae 
one inch and a quarter, next pair only three quarters of an 
inch, the remainder about half an inch.
The upper two thirds 
of the frond copiously fertile.
Since writing the account of this 
Fern on page 106, I have received additional fronds, and 
therefore add the above.
AcuTO-GRACiLE.
— Mr. Padley has sent me a long narrow 
form with the pinnse distant and ascending; too near to be 
otherwise named, but a very nice Fern.
Acuminatum, Moore.
— Since writing the account of this 
Fern, I have received fronds from Mr. El worthy.
His plant 
has grown considerably since it has been named by Mr.
Moore, and, at the same time, grown even more characteristic 
of its name.
The fronds are nearly three feet long, and six 
or seven inches broad in the widest part; flexuose near the 
apex.
Pinnae ascending and flexuose, somewhat distant, towards 
the apex bundled together, on account of their perpendicular 
growth; pinnae from two to three inches in length, being 
crowded together in a width of from one half to three quarters 
of an inch.
Pinnae long and narrow.
Pinnules remote below, 
and less so above, narrow, long, ascending, and acutely in- 
cised, with an acute auricle, abundantly hirsute.
The upper 
two thirds of frond copiously soriferous.

Jackson, which is densely scaly with pellucid almost colourless 
scales, which not only clothe the stipes, rachis, and cosfca of pinnee, but 
even the under side of the pinnules, extending beyond their edges, and 
giving them the appearance of being fringed with spines: this is more 
especially the case in the upper half of the frond.

Found in Devonshire by Mr. G.
B. Wol- 
laston, of Chiselhurst.
Pinnae unequal and irregular, opposite, alternate, 
or sub-opposite, without any order or regularity.
Some pinnae nearly three 
times the length of even those on the opposite side of the rachis; occa- 
sionally an extra pinna on the rachis, no longer, and of the same form 
186 POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
as a single pinnule.
Some pinnas ascending, others horizontal.
Pinnules 
varying considerably in size and form; in some pinnae they are triangular, 
with a cuneate base, scarcely auricular, two-spined, and uncut, except 
the serrated edges; in others strongly auricular and deeply cut, biserrate, 
and many-spined.
Some pinnae have a lengthy sub-tripinnate superior 
basal pinnule, whilst in other pinnae the superior basal pinnule does 
not differ from the rest.
In the upper half of the frond especially the 
spines all incline in one direction, in consequence of which one half of 
the spines lie on the leafy portion of the pinnule, giving the appearance 
of only being spiny on one margin.
Length of frond two feet.
Colour 
much paler beneath.
Stipes and rachis very hirsute, with reddish hair- 
like scales.
Sori irregular, in some pinnae very copious, in others very 
sparingly soriferous.
My thanks are due to Mr. WoUaston for fronds.

at Lisnaskea, in Ireland, by the Eev. W.
E. Bailey; near Whitby by Mr.
W. Willison; at Weston-super-Mare by Mr. H.
Parker.
Mr. Bailey's Fern 
is known as Baileyanum.
It has variously inciso-laciniate pinnules, or 
a few large angular teeth.
When the rachis has sometimes been 
developed into a horn it has been called Cornutum.
I am indebted to 
Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston Hall, for excellent fronds.
— A form 
which I have provisionally called Q-randidens-Greyi has been found in 
Devonshire by Mr. E.
J. Gray, of Alphington, near Exeter, (formerly of 
St. Thomas', Exeter.) This is the best form I have seen: it is dwarf in 
habit, nearly normal in outline, although the pinnas are somewhat 
POI.YSTICllUM ANfJULAKE.
187 
unequal in length.
Unlike the ordinary form of Grandidens, the pinnae 
are not abrupt, Ijut gradually taper to their apices; and this is also the 
case with the apex of the frond, giving the frond quite an Athyrium 
look.
I am indebted to Mr. R.
J. Gray for fronds.
— Since writing the 
account of this Fern I have received several forms of it from the Rev.
Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall.
Four plants, differing very much from 
each other, were found l>y Mrs. Thompson, of South Lawn, Exeter, at 
Clist Hydon, and these are the varieties forwarded by Mr. Padley.
One 
of the varieties, which has been provisionally called Grand Ulens-aiigti^- 
tiitirm, differs in l>eing narrower, the pinnules smaller, the upf>er third 
of the pinnas confluent.
Length twelve inches, width scarcely three 
quarters of an inch near the base, and only two inches in the widest 
]mrt.
Basal pinnae consisting of a pair of stalked, diminutive, cup-shaped 
pinnules; the rest of the pinnae undivided; being simply toothed on the 
edges; apex rounded.
The next few pinuje have two or three pairs of 
stalked rather larger pinnules and an undivided upper portion.
The 
largest pinnae have five or six pairs of stalked pinnules and a long 
undivided ajiex, conspicuously toothed, mostly bidentate.
Pinnules 
cuneate at the base, from rotund to ovate, occasionally linear or depau- 
I)erate.
Pinnae approximate and ascending.
Pinnules approximate.
The 
frond not narrowing to the a|x»x, ending abruptly in a similar pinna to 
those on either side the rachis, and equally developed, with equal-sized 
])innules.
Sori confined to the apex of the frond, situated on the edge 
of the pinnules, almost suprasoriferous.
— The second variety combines 
the characters of Graiididens and Aagnstifrons: it is eighteen inches in 
length, and two inches and a half wide, and partakes more of the 
characters of the latter variety.
— ^The third variety is more lax, more 
slender, has a less number of pinnules, and, though partaking of the 
characters of both Grandidens and Angustifrons, partakes more of the 
chai-acters of the former variety.
— The fourth variety is very singular, 
and might appropriately be called Grandldens-coiinv.tum.
It is only six 
inches in length, the stipes occupying two inches; width very various, 
from less than an inch to three inches and a half Pinnae two inches 
in length, being indiscriminately dispersed amongst others from under 
half an inch to an inch long.
Pinnae alternate and approximate, the 
smaller pinnae consisting of from one to four pinnides, and in place of 
an ultimate pinnule a cornute termination, the largest pinnae consisting 
of from six to eight pairs of stalked pinnules and a long undivided apex.
Pinnules very various both in size and form, no two alike.
A very 
slender and singular Fern.

much the largest, and inclined downwards.
The pinnules on the lower 
side of the pinnae twice the length of those on the upper side.

The Eev.
C. Padley has found in Devonshire a form of this Fern, with fronds 
from twenty to twenty-two inches long, and five inches and a half 
wide, except the upper half, which gradually becomes narrower.
Pinnae 
opposite and sub-opposite below, alternate above.
Somewhat similar to 
the Irish form, except that the frond is not altered or praemorse, except 
near the apex.
Mr. Elworthy has sent me a form found near Nettle- 
combe, formerly called Ahnijptum, (a variety not sufficiently distinct from 
Prcemorsum.) Length fourteen inches, width very narrow, only two 
inches and a half in the widest part.
Pinnas more or less abrupt; 
pinnules remote, very various in size and shape, more or less laciniated 
or depauperated; the two or three basal pairs of pinnules smaller than 
190 POLYSTICHUM AXGULARE.
those near the apex of the pinna.
— Mr. Wollaston considers that Latum 
of Moore can only be looked upon as a variety of Prcamorsum, and I 
have adopted this view, although in some respects it is different.
In 
fronds received from Mr. Elworthy of a plant found near Nettlecombe, I 
find the length is thirty inches, and width in widest part seven inches.
There are above twenty pairs of pinnae, which are five inches in length, 
narrower and more attenuated, with less-crowded pinnules, which, 
however, are similar in form to Prriiynorsum.
The pinnoB curl upwards 
at a considerable angle.
Found at Barnstaple by the late Mr. C.
Jackson; at Ilfracombe by Mr. J.
Dodds; and at Nettlecombe by Mr.

As there is a marked difference between the Irish 
and Devon form of Prcemorsum, it seems desirable to distinguish it by 
the addition of the name of the discoverer.
I have therefore called Fig.

A form 
with narrow pinnules has been discovered at Ide by Mr. R.
J. Gray.
Another form, which is peculiar from the dense mass of long red scales 
on the rachis, and which is strikingly effective in the lower half of the 
frond, was found at Monk Leigh, in IN'orfch Devonshire, by the Rev.
Charles Padley.
Found also at Whitby by Mr. W.
Willison, and near 
Brighton by the Rev. H.
Rooper.
To all these gentlemen I am indebted 
for fronds.
Dr. Kinaham, in August, 1849, found this plant growing on 
slate rocks by the side of a stream, which, running through Friarstown 
House demesne, falls into the Dodder, just above Bohernabreena, County 
Dublin.

large stout noble-looking Fern, of a very dark green, the rachis very 
thick and scaly at the base; and, instead of growing upright the fronds 
spread out horizontally, or are slanting upwards.

The Rev.
Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall, has found a dwarf form at Littleham, 
in Devonshire.
Mrs. Thompson, of South Lawn, Exeter, has found a 
very fine form, the fronds being twenty-four inches in length, no two 
pinnae being alike.
Mrs. Thompson has also found near Exeter a singular 
variety, which will apparently be very distinct, but which is as yet too 
immature to describe.
I am indebted to Mrs. Thompson, the Rev.
Charles Padley, and to Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston Hall, for many 
fronds.

192 POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
Pohjstichum angulare is a siiecics very easily cultivated, 
growing luxuriantly in our ordinary ferneries in any light 
loam, and especially delighting to grow in a soil that is 
enriched by decaying vegetable matter.
It prefers a well- 
drained somewhat shady situation, and requires abundance of 
space for the expansion of its roots.
There are so many well-marked varieties, that a fine collection 
of this single species will alone occupy a large space in the 
British fernery.
Indeed, not only are there more than one 
hundred and fifty named varieties, but there are at least one 
hundred forms of some of these varieties, combining the 
characteristic features of one or more other forms in combi- 
nation with its own particular form.
Thus, the section Tri- 
pinnatum embraces a vast number of plants very distinct in 
character from each other, yet bearing primary features that 
mark the particular variety from whence it takes its name.
The same may be said of the varieties Biserratum, Decompositum^ 
Laxum, Laciniatum, Cristatum, Proliferum, Semitripinnatum, 
Decurrens, and Dissi7nile.
Were all the varieties to receive 
name there would be no end to the number of varieties.
Some are more, and others less-developed forms, and each 
variety will frequently change its character on becoming more 
mature; thus, Semitripinnatum may become a fully-developed 
Tripinnatum, or even become Suhquadripinnatum.
It therefore 
requires great care in distinguishing many of the forms, but at 
the same time, when special characters are apparent, it seems 
desirable to distinguish these, although they may in some 
respects approach one or other of existing forms.
In Tri- 
pinnatum, for instance, the original plant, brought into notice 
by myself, is quite distinct from the many forms which now 
bear this name; and I agree with Mr. Wollaston that the 
two forms cannot belong to the same variety; and although 
this was the first which received the name, still the subsequent 
ones are simply tripinnate varieties, and answer exactly to their 
name, whereas the original form has several marked features 
that do not of necessity belong to a tripinnate variety, (such 
as the peculiar chaffy appearance of the under side of the 
fronds and the horizontal position of the pinna;, these being 
peculiar to this plant alone, and not being requisite features 
POLYSTICHUM ANGULARE.
193 
for a simple tripinnate frond.
Mr. Wollaston suggested the 
alteration of the name, and, acting upon this ad'v-ice, I have 
changed it to Acliurod.es, on account of its chaffyness.
The 
coloured Plate (XIV,) will therefore represent this variety, of 
which the description on page 78 wiU be found to refer to 
Achurodes, and not to the more common form of Tripinnatum, 
which, although answering most of that description, is not 
chaffy, nor has it horizontal pinna?.
In speaking of what is called a normal form, I cannot do 
better than quote Mr. Wollaston, whose experience on the 
subject is very great.
He considers that Suhtripinnatum is a 
vigorous perfectly natural development ; beyond it again De- 
compositum is the maximum of normal development.
Biserratum 
is also a vigorous normal growth, generally found near the 
sea; and unless these three forms are in excess they are no 
varieties.
If they and the intermediate forms ranked as 
varieties, every one picked up would be so.
Of a hundred 
plants gathered miscellaneously from the hedge no two are 
alike; some, particularly extremes, are very unlike; but Mr.
Wollaston considers them all normal, although he says that it 
requires an intimate knowledge of them to believe they are 
not different species.

Polystichum — From tlie Greek, polys — many, and sticlios — order.
Aculeatum — Prickl}'-.
This very near ally of Polystichum angulare was considered 
by the older botanists as identical witli it, and, even at the 
present day, by some authorities, as doubtfully distinct.
On 
the other hand there are those who would even again divide 
it into Polystichum aculeatum and Polystichum lohatum.
My 
experience of this latter Fern leads me to consider it as 
unworthy of even the rank of a variety, as in the young state 
the plants are always simply lobate, whilst the more mature 
plant gradually loses this character.
It has only the permanence 
of youthfulness, and, although found fertile, must be regarded 
as the young state of Polystichum aculeatu7n, which will 
eventually assume its normal characters.
An inhabitant of damp shady banks, along hedgerows or in 
woods.
A widely-spread and common Fern, recorded as 
inhabiting Cornwall, Devonshire, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire,

Antrim, Gahvay, Wicklow, Dublin, Clare, Cork, Londonderry, 
Sligo, and Channel Islands.
Abroad it is a native of Scandinavia, Switzerland, Germany, 
Holland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, 
Turkey, Austria, Russia, Africa, Island of Madeira, and United 
States of America.
In 1860, whilst travelling amongst the 
Spanish Mountains, along the spurs of the Pyrenees, I found 
Polystichum aculeatum repeatedly.
On the Villia Escusa, a 
mountain a few miles south of Reinosa, this Fern was grooving 
luxuriantly amidst the street-like rocks, so much so as to be a 
shelter to the numerous wolves and foxes that inhabit this 
mountain.
A\Tiilst the asphodel, rock rose, iris, linum, and 
many other splendid alpine plants, were richly strewn over 
the open land, this Fern occupied every available space where 
there was shelter and moisture.
It was seen peeping out of 
the Horodada, in the Congosto Pass, amongst the trees in the 
Hoz de Barcena, on the Pena Castilla at Fuento del Mar, and 
where lashed by the waves of the Bay of Biscay at Santander.
In the Highlands of Scotland it ascends upwards of two 
thousand feet above the sea, and in Northern Spain I have 
seen it most common above the height of three thousand 
feet.
A very easily-cultivated species in a loamy soil, and a some- 
what shady situation.
It is an elegant Fern, and, being 
evergreen, is a desirable plant in a hardy fernery.
This species 
differs from Pohjstichum angulare in being more upright in 
growth, stouter, and more rigid in texture.
The fronds are from twelve to thirty-six inches in length, 
and from four to seven inches in width, leathery in texture, 
deep green on the upper surface, smooth, lanceolate in form, 
and bipinnate.
The pinnae obliquely lanceolate.
The pinnules 
ovate-falcate or elliptic, their apices aristate.
Auricular on 
the anterior side, the auricle being acute and mucronate.
The 
basal anterior pinnule on each pinna is usually much larger 
than the rest.
Veins branched from a flexuose mid-vein.
Stipes brief, densely covered with broad scales; usual length 
from three to four inches.
Rachis stout and densely scaly.
Fructification mostly confined to the upper half of the frond.
198 
POLYSTICHUM ACULEATUM.
Sori circular and indusiate, eventually confluent.
Indusiura 
membranaceous.
This species is not so proliferous in varieties as Polystichum 
angulare.
The following may be described: — 
Fig. 157.
— Middle pinnae, and basal pinnte.
LoBATUM, Deakin, (Fig. 157.) — Having narrow lance-shaped 
frondsj from twelve to twenty-four inches in length, sub- 
pinnate, as only a few of the basal pinnae have pinnules.
The anterior basal pinnule is much larger, and the auricle 
larger; the remainder decurrent or confluent, and not auricled.
A common variety, found in many places in Yorkshire, by 
Mr. A.
Clapham, of Scarborough; at Chaigeley Manor, near 
Clitheroe, Morecombe Bay, and at Preston, Lancashire, by 
myself; at Matlock, in Derbyshire, and also at Cromford, .by 
myself; at Paplewick, Bulwell, WoUaston, Beeston, and 
Stanton-on-the-Wolds, by myself; in the lake district near 
Ambleside, Patterdale, and Coniston, by myself; in Warwick-

Other authorities have 
found it in Somersetshire, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Sussex, 
Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Essex, Suflfolk, 
POLYSTTCHUM ACULEATUM.
199 
Northamptonshire, jNIonmouthshire, Herefordshire, Staffordshire, 
Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Cheshire, Northumberland, and 
Cumberland.
It is also common to both North and South 
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
Mr. Thomas Moore has found 
it in Perthshire and Argyleshire, Mr. D.
Moore in Londonderry.
It is also recorded as inhabiting Forfar, Argyleshire, Kosshire, 
Dumfries, Edinburgh, Berwick, Lanark, Kirkcudbright, Isle of 
Cantyre, Isle of Islay, Antrim, "Wicklow, Sligo, and Clare.
The very common occurrence of this form seems to be a 
strong argument that it is either a distinct species, or merely 
a certain growth of the normal form.
I feel convinced that 
the latter is the true view to take of the subject.
I have 
removed many plants to my fernery, every one of which have 
Eventually become Aculeatum true.
Mr. Moore, however, 
remarks that it is not the case with his experience, and 
therefore I have included it as a variety on so good an 
authority, much against the advice of several well-known 
Fern-growers.
The Rev. Charles Padley, of BulweU HaU, who 
has devoted much time to the Polystichums, confirms my 
experience.
It is qmte possible that a few isolated plants may 
retain the lobate character, and to these this variety must be 
confined.

Pinnules equal in size botli above and below, with 
a larger superior basal pinnule more deeply cut, and especially

Stipes, rachis, and rachides covered with dark brown scales.
Vivid green above, paler beneath.
Sori very copious, about 
six pairs of spore-cases on each pinnule.
This plant approaches 
the Polystichum angulare, var.
Duhium, but has narrower 
pinnules, which are more pointed.
There is but little diiFerence, 
the one however, more nearly resembles Polystichum angulare, 
whilst the other as nearly resembles Polystichum aculeatum.
It is unnecessary to give an illustration, as on referring to 
page 86, fig.
53 will give a good idea of the plant, if it is 
remembered that the difference consists in the pinnules being 
narrower and more attenuated.

Daniels, of Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire, for fronds from 
plants found in his neighbourhood.

This is named pro-

character.
Length of frond ten inches.
There are several distinct forms of Polystichum aculeatum 
that have not been deemed sufficiently marked to warrant 
names being given, and yet differing sufficiently to demand 
woodcut illustrations, as otherwise confusion might be occa- 
sioned.
Polystichum aculeatum, it must be borne in mind, 
puts on every intermediate form between Lohatum and the 
fully-developed normal form; there is every gradation (mostly 
owing to the age of the plant) from the t\-pical Lohatum 
to the typical Aculeatum.
Some varieties are less, and others 
more developed than usual.
The figures on the next page 
are three of these forms, and a reference to them will shew 
that in all essential respects there is no distinctive difference.

GENUS V.
LASTREA.
Presl.
A GEXUs having herbaceous or coriaceous fronds.
Caudex creeping, erect, or decumbent, short and stout.
The fertile fronds are sometimes slightly contracted.
Veins simple, forked, or pinnate from a central costa; venules 
free, the anterior fertile, and occasionally others.
Sori globose, and having an indusium; the receptacles usually 
medial.
TTie distinction consists in the rounded reniform 
indusium, and in its position, being attached at the basal sinus.
There are, according to Moore, eight -well-marked British 
species, namely, — L.
thelypteris, montana, JiUx-mas, remota, 
rigida, cristata, dilatata, and cemida.
As we proceed I think it will be shewn that more than 
this number of species exist in our island, and that, as an 
instance, in what we have considered hitherto as Lastrea 
filiz-mas, we have in reality embraced three distinct species, 
which Mr. Wollaston proposes shall henceforth bear their 
specific rank under the names of Lastrea Jilix-mas, Presl ; L.
pseudo-mas, Wollaston; and L.
j^f'ojiinjna, Wollaston.

The Lastrea remota is a handsome Fern.
It was first

Lastrea spinulosa.
To Mr. Thomas Moore, of the Chelsea 
Botanic Gardens, we arc indebted for bringing the present

species before the public.
This well-known authority in Ferns 
received fronds from Mr. Clowes, and recognised in them the 
Aspidium remotum of Braun, announcing the discovery to the 
Linna3an Society, on the 15th.
of December, 1859.
Thus another 
species has recently been added to our British Ferns.
A hardy deciduous species.
Native of Southern Germany, and Windermere, Westmorland.
The fronds, which are erect, are narrow oblong-lanceolate, 
smooth, and sub-tripinnate ; the pinna; ascending, opposite or 
sub-opposite, distant below, and ovate-acuminate in form.
Pinnules an inch and a ^quarter in length, briefly stalked, 
almost pinnate, serrated, and more especially at the apex; ovate 
below, and linear-oblong at their greatest distance from the 
main racliis.
Veins branched.
Sori medial and conspicuous, consisting of two rows near the 
costa.
The fructification covering the whole under side of the frond.
Indusium kidney-shaped and persistent.
Stipes and racliis stout, and covered with numerous scales; 
stipes twelve inches in length.
Lower pinna?
three to four 
inches in length, central pinnse six inches.
Length of frond from three to four feet.
For fronds my thanks are due to INIr. F.
Clowes, of 
Windermere; Mr. Stansfield, of Todmorden; and Mr. Swynfen 
Jervis, of Darlaston Hall, Staffordshire.
The illustration is from a frond of the original plant, sent

214 LASTBEA RIGIDA.
Lastrea — ?
Bigida — Rigid.
The Rigid Shield Fern, or, as Mr. Moore has called it, the 
Rigid Buclilcr Fern, is a pretty hardy deciduous British 
species, easily grown both in a Fernery and under pot-culture.
A local species, confined to the limestone mountains of "West- 
morland, Lancaster, and York, and even in these localities 
extending over a small area.
In Ireland it has been found 
in the county of Louth.
In England Mr. Moore remarks 
that it ranges between twelve and fifteen hundred feet above 
the sea-level.
It is a native of France, Switzerland, Sardinia, Sicily, Calabria, 
Germany, Dalmatia, Croatia, Hungary, Morea, Siberia, Asia 
Minor, California, and Massachusetts ; in the two latter countries 
it attains a smaller size.
The caudex is thick, tufted, scaly, and decumbent.
Stipes 
short, densely scaly.
Rachis scaly.
Venation branched.
Fronds 
bipinnate, triangularly elongate.
Pinnae alternate, triangular in 
form.
Pinnules oblong, base truncate, apex obtuse.
Length 
from one to two feet; colour dull green, paler on the under 
side.
Numerous minute glands are scattered over the frond, 
giving it a somewhat glaucous appearance.
There are no permanent varieties of this species.
The Lastrea rigida is readily recognised from L.
JiUx-mas, 
by its more rigid habit, and by the dusty look of its fronds 
and their smaller size.
For plants of L.
rigida I am indebted to Mr. Joseph Side- 
botham, of Manchester; Mr. Wraight, of Newlands; Mr. Clapham, 
of Scarbro'; and the late Mr. Clarke, gardener to INIr. Wilkin- 
son Dent, of Flass House, Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland; 
to Mr. Clarke my obligations are more particularly due for 
an extensive series of specimens of this species, gathered in his 
neighbourhood.
The Rev. G.
Finder found this Fern in great profusion 
growing in the crevices of rocks along the whole of the great 
scar limestone district between Arnside and Ingleborough, being 
most abundant on Hutton Roof Crags and Farlton Knot.
It 
is usually much damaged by wind, and also by sheep.
The 
sheep seem fond of eating its fronds.
LASTREA RIGIDA.
215 
There are two forms of growth, one triangular and the other 
oblong; but the latter form does not seem to be permanent.
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of Chiselhua'st, has found a variety in 
which the fronds, or the pinnae, or both, are more or less 
multifidly divided at the apex.
Messrs.
Stansfield and Co., of Todmorden, have also procured 
a ramose variety from Ingleton Fells.
None of these varieties have proved constant, and cannot 
therefore be named.
The illustration is fiom a plant in my own collection.

The Marsh oi* Female Buckler Fern is an interesting bog- 
growing species.
Found in England in Devonshire, Somersetshire, Hampshire, 
Sussex, Kent, Surrey, Berkshire, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, 
Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Warwickshire, 
Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, 
Nottinghamshire, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, 
and Isle of Wight.
In Wales in Glamorganshire, Pembrokeshire, 
Carnarvonshire, and the Island of Anglesea.
In Scotland in 
Forfarshire and Shetland.
In Ireland in Antrim, Galway, 
Mayo, Wicklow, and Kerry.
General throughout Europe, Algiers, Cape of Good Hope, 
New Zealand, Russian Asia, and North America.
In a fernery a low boggy situation should be formed, where 
this Fern would flourish luxuriantly with the Osmunda regalis, 
a damp peaty soil being absolutely necessaiy for the growth 
of this plant.
Fronds lanceolate, membranaceous, erect; pinnate, pinna) 
numerous, spreading, linear-lanceolate, and deeply pinnatifid.
The fertile fronds have the margins of their segments revolute, 
are taller, and have a stouter stipes.
Veins forked.
Fructifi- 
cation extending over the whole under side of the frond.
Sori small, circular, and placed near the base of the venules.
Indusium small and circular.
Stipes as long as the leafy portion of the fertile frond; 
smooth and round behind, channeled in front, near the base 
black and polished, above pale green.
Rachis smooth and circular behind, and channeled in front.
Caudex creeping.
Length of frond from six to forty-eight inches; colour 
delicate green.
Easily cultivated in a damp situation with abundance of peaty 
soil.
This species I have procured wild from Oxton Bogs, and 
for other plants I am indebted to Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart., 
of Bolleston Hall, and for fronds to Mr. Norman, of Hull.
The illustration is from a plant in my own collection.

In 
LASTREA MONTANA.
221 
Spain, in 1860, I found it near Boo, Lascaldas, Santander, in 
the Hoz de Barcena, Cartes, and between Reinosa and Allar.
The Mountain Fern has fragrant fronds of from twelve to 
forty inches in length, and from three to eleven inches in 
breadth; the colour bright green or yellowish green, of a vivid 
refreshing appearance.
Underneath there are a profusion of 
small resinous glands, which give out a balsamic odour that is 
exceedingly agreeable.
Fronds pinnate and lanceolate, tapering considerably both to 
the base and apex.
Pinnae linear-lanceolate, numerous, profoundly 
pinnatifid, the basal ones short, triangular, and more distant.
Lobes oblong, flat, and mostly entire.
Sori marginal, most abundant on the upper portion of the 
frond, circular, of moderate size, frequently confluent.
Indusium 
diminutive and very thin, mostly imperfect, often wanting.
Caudex perennial and tufted, stout and creeping.
The fronds 
annual, springing up in May, and being destroyed by the first 
frosts of autumn.
Stipes brief, stout, and glandular, covered 
with pale brown membranaceous scales.
Rachis scaly below.
A very readily distinguished species, and although frequently 
found in low boggy situations, it is much more profusely 
abundant in mountainous districts.
In Great Britain it ranges 
from the sea level to three thousand feet.
Like Lastrea the- 
lypteris, this Fern must be grown in a wet peaty situation.
There are several interestinof varieties: —

Crtst.\.t.\, Moore.
(Fig. 174.) — Found in Monmouthshire by 
Mr. T- H.
Thomas.
A lovely form analogous to the cristate 
form of Lastrea propinqua, (the Lastrea jilix-mas cristata of 
authors.) The fronds are somewhat smaller than the normal

form, and are corymbosely-branched towards their apices, the 
branches being dilated into broad cristate tassels; the apices of 
the pinnae are also niultifid-crisped, although not to that degree 
as the apex of the frond.
My thanks arc due to Mr. F.
Clowes, 
of Windermere, and to IVIessrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, for 
fronds.

Crispa, Moore.
(Fig. 175.) — Found on the Clova Mountains

the pinnules undulated or wavy, so that the frond has a 
crispy appearance.

(Fig. 176.) — A permanent and re- 
markable variety found near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, by Mr.
G. B.
Wollaston, and at Llanberis, Carnarvonshire, by the Rev.
J. M.
Chanter.
The peculiarity consists in the extremities of 
the fronds, and also of nearly all the pinnae ending abruptly, 
and the extremity of the rachis projecting frequently a quarter 
of an inch beyond the pinnules.
This peculiarity gives the

223 
plant the appearance of having had the extremities of all the 
pinnae eaten off in a uniform manner by some insect or mollusk, 
and the elegant outline destroyed.
In other respects this plant 
is normal.

(Fig. 177.)— The Lastrea montana is 
one of the least variable of the British Ferns, but this variety 
is by far the most extraordinary hitherto discovered.
It was

Nowell, and Mr. A.
Stansfield, of Tocbnorden,

LASl'REA MONTANA.
neai' Lake Gyrionedd, in North Wales, September l^tli., 1860, 
and has been tested in the fernery at the Vale Nurseries, 
Todmorden, and proves perfectly constant.
The fronds are pin- 
nate, the pinnae linear, very narrow, and terminating much more 
abruptly than in the normal species.
The rachis or midrib of 
the frond frequently terminates in a horn-like projection near 
the apex of the frond.
The pinnules are very short, generally 
only about one third of the length of those in the ordinary 
form; they are deeply cut and serrated, and in this respect 
the variety Noioelliana differs entirely from the normal type, 
and indeed has quite as much the appearance of an Athyrium 
as a Lastrea.
The sori bold and conspicuous.
The fronds 
are from twelve to twenty-four inches in length.
My thanks 
are due to Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, for the illustration.
Very characteristic fronds have been received from Mr. F.
Clowes, of Windermere; Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston 
Hall; and from Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden.

narrowed and drawn out to a considerable length.
The apex 
of the frond is often divided in a trifid manner.
Fronds elon-

228 LASTREA CRTSTATA, 
The varieties Uliginosa and Sjnnulosa of Moore have been 
separated from Lastrea cristata, on account of a conviction 
that they are distinct from this species.
The former has been 
described as a species by Newman, both as Lastrea uliginosum 
and Lophodium uliginosum; and the latter by Presl, Babington, 
Sowerby, and Moore as Lastrea spinulosa, by Newman as 
Lastrea spinosa, by Mliller as Poly podium spinulosum, by 
Hoffman as Poly podium cristatum, by Swartz, Schkuhr, 
Sprengel, Fee, Mettenius, and myself as Aspidium spinulosum, 
by Strempel as Nephrodium spinulosum, by Roth as Polysfi- 
chum spinosum, and by Newman as Ijophodium spinosum.
There 
is something to me so very distinct in the above two Ferns 
from Lastrea cristata, that I have hesitated in placing them 
with the present Fern.
Found in Norfolk, Suffolk, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, 
Cheshire, and Yorkshire.
In Nottinghamshire it is now con- 
fined to Oxton Bogs, where it was originally seen by Dr.
Howitt.
The other habitat, Bulwell Marshes, has now ceased 
to be a locality: ten years ago I observed it, though rare, in 
this place.
In Suffolk it is recorded as occurring near Ipswich, 
and at Westleton; in Norfolk in the neighbourhood of Lynn, 
Yarmouth, Norwich, and Holt; in Staffordshire it is recorded 
from near Newcastle-under-Lyne and Madcley; in Cheshire, 
the Rev. G.
Finder found it on Wybunbury Bog; and from 
Yorkshire Mr. Monkman sends fronds from the neighbourhood 
of Malton.
A new station near Malton was discovered by Mr.
John Mackle in 1857.
It does not appear to be found more 
than three hundred feet above the sea level.
From the foregoing it will be seen that Lastrea cristata is 
a very local Fern, growing only near bogs.
All the plants I 
have seen are growing amongst grass in lumps of soil that are 
elevated a foot or so above the bog, especially on the sides of 
large tufts of Air a ccespitosa.
Abroad it is generally spread throughout Europe, being as 
far north as Moscow, Scandinavia, and Siberia, It is a native 
of France, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Belgium, 
Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, and Bccotia.
Also found in 
Canada and the United States.
This Fern requires to be grown in peaty soil, with plenty 
LASTREA TRTSTATA.
229 
of moisture.
The habit is upright, and distinct from all other 
British species.
Unless under cultivation it is grown in a peaty soil, and 
in a damp situation, this Fern becomes sickly, and will merely 
drag on a miserable existence for two or three years, and 
then die; whilst if nature is copied in its growth, the plant 
will flourish, and when established in its proper situation, a 
handsome plant may be obtained.
The rhizoma creeps on the 
surface, sending roots through the moss to the bog below.
Owing to the drainage of bosr°rv situations, the Lastrea cristata 
is becoming more scarce.
In the Nottingham locality, (Oxton 
Bogs,) much drainage has been carried on, and its habitation 
has been somewhat contracted; but I believe that the proprietor, 
Mr. Henry Shcrbrook, will respect its present home, and that 
there is no likelihood of this Fern being exterminated in our 
county.
The locality is an interestinjj one, narrow and wild, 
with a trout-stream running through it, on the banks of which 
are many interesting plants, uncommon mosses, and rare insects.
Fronds erect, narrow, linear-oblong, sub-bipinnate, or bipin- 
nate, tapering at the apex; pinnae brief and triangular; 
pinnules oblong, connected at the base, crenato-serrate on the 
margin.
Veins forked.
Fructification copious, usually occupying the 
upper half of the frond.
Sori circular, numerous, indusiate, 
and medial.
Indusium reniform, flat, and membranous.
Length of frond from twelve to thirtv-six inches; colour 
heavy green.
IxTERRUPTA, Monkmon.
— This form, which corresponds with 
the varieties of Polystichum angular e and Lastrea Jilix-mas, so 
named, was found by Mr. C.
Monkman, in the Malton station, 
in 1860.
Both barren and fertile fronds were well marked.
Some years ago I had found similar plants on Oxton Bogs, 
but they did not' prove permanent, Mv thanks are due to 
Mr. Monkman for fronds.
FuRCAXS, Monkman.
— From the Malton station.
Not uni- 
formly cleft, and sub-permanent.
An interesting furcate variety, 
equal in size to the normal or type form, but doubtfully 
permanent.
My thanks are due to Mr. Monkman for fronds.

The Male Fern, or Common Buckler Fern, as it is sometimes 
called, is one of our most common and most widely distributed 
British species.
Equally common in all the counties of England, 
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Northern 
Islands, and Western Islands, ascending the hills in Scotland 
to the elevation of fifteen hundred feet.
Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of Chiselhurst, who has bestowed great 
care and attention in the examination of this Fern, is convinced 
that it consists of three distinct species, namely, Lastrea jilix- 
mas, Lastrea pseudo-mas, and Lastrea propinqua, three species 
unmistakeably distinct, an account of which he has communicated 
to the "Phytologist," and which the Editor of that periodical, 
printed in January of the present year.
(See page 415.) 
It is true that the three species connect one another by their 
various forms and varieties, but at the same time it is equally 
true that the distinctive differences are also recognisable.
The 
lover of Ferns, and more especially of British Ferns, is much 
indebted to Mr. G.
B." Wollaston, for all his valuable researches 
in this difficult field of investigation, and I think they must feel 
bound to adopt Mr. G.
B. WoUaston's views, and separate this 
ancient family into three distinct species.
With Mr. WoUaston's 
views I entirely agree, indeed in describing Lastrea jilix-mas 
in my "History of British and Exotic Ferns," Vol. YI, I was 
then convinced that all the so-called varieties could not be 
traced to the same parents, and on page 42 I described one 
of the varieties as belonging to a distinct species.
It requires some considerable amount of courage to make so 
serious an alteration with regard to the British species, especially 
when such well-known authorities as Hooker, Moore, and 
Babington have not seen sufficient reason to make such alteration, 
nevertheless there are many well-kno^vn authorities of the present 
day who will hail with satisfaction an alteration that has seemed 
deiirable, especially when so careful an observer of this branch 
of Botany as Mr. Wollaston has adopted this course, and I 
therefore feel less diffidence in followinsr his views.
The following brief descriptive difference of the three species, 
as described by Mr. Wollaston, will shew how different the three 
forms arc: — 
234 LASTREA FILTX-MAS.
Lastrea FiLix-MAS, Prssl.
— Partially deciduous, lying pros- 
trate in winter; fronds lanceolate, bipinnate, attaining about five 
feet in length; pinnse elongate-deltoid, pinnate; pinnules oval, 
serrate, very slightly auricled, the lowest pair being rather longer 
than the rest; indusium, when young, sub-peltate, (or like an 
inverted soup-plate,) not embracing the spore-cases, partially 
evanescent.
Lastrea pseudo-mas, Wollaston.
— Sub-evergreen, not pros- 
trate in winter, coriaceous; fronds lanceolate, bipinnate, attaining 
full five feet in length; pinna?
elongate-deltoid, or pyramidal, 
pinnate; pinnules paralleloid, or linear-obtuse, not auricled, 
serratulate, the first anterior and posterior pair scarcely longer 
than the rest; indusium, when young, embracing the spore-cases, 
persistent, sub-rotund, depressed.
Lastrea propinqua, Wollaston.
— Deciduous, entirely sub- 
alpine; fronds ovate-lanceolate, bipinnate, attaining but rarely 
four feet in length; pinnae pinnate, pyramidal, inciso-lobate ; 
pinnules biserrulate, crisped, strongly auricled, basal pair stipitate, 
much longer than the rest; indusium embracing the spore-cases.
There are several varieties belonging to these three species, 
that it is doubtful at the present moment as to which species 
to refer them; it has therefore been deemed the wisest course 
to retain the whole under one head, namely, the original name, 
Lastrea jilix-mas, special reference being made to such as have 
been well determined as to the species to which they belong.
Lastrea jilix-mas, in the widest acceptation, embracing L.
pseudo-rnas and L.
propinqua, is found in almost every part 
of Great Britain and Ireland: in some places the true L.
jilix-mas is the common form, whilst in others the L.
propinqua 
is more abundant.
Each species has a number of varieties.
The well-known and beautiful multifid Fern known as L.
jilix-mas, var.
cristata, does not belong to this species, but to 
the L.
propinqua of Wollaston.
The L.
jilix-mas abhreviata- 
cristata of authors, is in reality L.
pseudo-mas , var.
cristata, 
whilst L.
jilix-mas, tar.
Jcrcisii, belongs to the true L.
jilix- 
LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
23o 
mas.
L. Jilix-mas is a large coarse Fern, L.
propinqua being 
much more compact, and more beautiful in its outline.
The L.
pseudo-mas is usually less in size, although there are some 
varieties that are anything but dwarf.
These three species, in their normal form, appear to grow- 
well in almost every conceivable situation.
In dry woods or 
wet woods, in shady lanes, by the side of running water, or 
amongst rocks, almost immaterial what the nature of the soil, 
or the peculiar circumstances under which they have to grow.
The Male Fern is abundant throughout Europe.
Also found 
in Africa, Madeira, Newfoundland, California, Guatemala, 
Mexico, Equador, New Grenada, Peru, Brazil, and the Caraccas.
It has long been esteemed as a medical plant: Theophrastus, 
Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen, each speak of its medicinal 
virtues.
Madame Nouffer sold to Louis the Sixteenth, for 
eighteen thousand francs, her secret for the treatment of tape- 
worm, ( Tcenia solium,) and this proved to be the L.
Jilix-mas.
It has also been put to other economic uses, namely, the tanning 
of leather, the manufacture of glass, the bleaching of linen, 
the young stems eaten like asparagus, the bases of the young 
stalks brewed into beer by the Norwegians, and the fronds 
cut and dried as fodder and litter for cattle.
Lastrea Jilix-mas is an effective plant in a fernery, and 
some of the varieties are exceedingly beautiful.
A deciduous Fern, varying from four or five inches in the 
dwarf varieties, to four or five feet in those with more robust 
habits.
The rhizoma large, firm, and woody, covered with thick 
brown imbricated scales, and having numerous long black 
tough roots.
The fronds are broadest in the middle, narrowing towards 
the base, and to an acute point at the apex.
Pinnae from ten to fifty, mostly remote near the base, 
becoming more approximate upwards, and running together at 
the apex.
Pinnules largest at the base, decreasing upwards till they 
run together, losing themselves in the point or apex of the 
pinnae.
Sori abundant and larcre, and covered with an indusium.

(Figs.

Found near Darlaston Hall, Staf- 
fordshire, by Mr. Swynfen Jervis.
A large-growing tasseled 
Fern, having wide lanceolate fronds, four feet in length, with 
acuminated apices.
Pinna?
elongated, and the margin somewhat 
irregular, the basal portion divided into acute pinnules with 
serrated edges, the upper portion cut into shallow acute lobes, 
which point forwards, and extend to the base of the tassel.
Tassel spread out and subcristate, yet not so much tufted as 
in other crested forms.
In many respects this Fern is almost 
typical.
Being a coarse-growing variety, it has a fine appearance

in a fernery, with its many broad tosseled fronds.
ISIr. Swynfen

plants and fronds.
^ 
Fig. 18G.
Abbreviata, Babington and Moore, fLastrea j)^<^^^^o-mas , 
AVollaston.) (Fig. 186.) — This interesting variety is peculiarly 
distinct from Lastrea JiUx-mas, and Mr. AYollaston proposes to 
place it as a distinct species under the name of Lastrea pseudo- 
mas.
The pinnules have a curled character strikingly different 
to the flat pinnules of Lastrea Jilix-nias, whilst the usual solitary 
spore-case on each pinnule of Lastrea pseudo-mas is equally a 
marked contrast to the six or eight spore-cases on each pinnule 
of Lastrea Jilix-mas.
I have always been struck with the 
distinct character of this Fern, but never more so than when 
on a botanical tour in the county of Durham last autumn.
This Fern is common along the banks of the Tees, above High 
Force (a stupendous waterfall about four miles above Middleton,) 
where the whole of the river Tees falls throuerh a crevice in 
O 
the rocks perpendicularly down seventy feet, with a roar that 
can be heard at a great distance; and occasional plants occur 
here and there along Widdicomb Moor and Cronkley Fell, 
becoming more abundant as we approached Cauldron Snout 
from the Glints, being in great abundance amongst the rocks 
and heather from the upper portion of this very lengthy and 
2 I 
2SS 1,ASTREA FIMX-MAS.
beautiful waterfall to below its base, where the three counties of 
Durham, Westmorland, and Yorkshire approach so near together 
that a stone can be thrown into all three counties from the 
same spot, a feat of no difficulty, but one which the guides 
are always anxious that each person should accomplish.
In 
this locality the variety ahhreciata grows on a damp, peaty 
soil amongst rocks, mostly large sized specimens which would 
readily have divided into no less than twenty distinct plants, 
and this seemed to be quite the character of the variety, for 
the few plants of the normal form of Lastrea Jilix-mas had not 
this disposition, being mostly composed of single crowns.
With 
this Fern were found growing Cystopteris fragilis, Lomaria 
spicant, AUosorus crisjms, Asplenitwi tricliomanes , Asj^lenium 
viride, Pteris aquilina, Lycopodium selago, Lycopodium clavatum, 
Primula farinosa, Nardus stricta, Caluna vulgaris, the butter- 
wort, saffron, Caltha palustris and several other interesting 
plants.
Near High Force this variety was growing amongst a 
vast quantity of the lovely British wild flower Gentiana verna, 
a plant that must, in spring, when in bloom, make the spot 
exceedingly beautiful.
Ahhrcviata is also found on Snowdon and Ingleborough ; in 
Lancashire, Westmorland, Cumberland, Gloucestershire, Forfar- 
shire, and at Killarney.
A small Fern, usually not more than twelve or fourteen 
inches in length, and in some degree resembling another form 
(pumila,) but larger and broader, having more coarse pinnules 
which are not recurved to the same degree as in pumila.
Fronds pinnate, the pinnse scarcely pinnate, the basal pinnules 
alone being separated to the costa, the rest dccurrcnt.
Owing 
to the recurved character of the pinnules the upper surface of 
the pinna; is concave.
Pinnules comparatively large, broad, and 
rounded, the lobes crenate-lobatc.
A rave Fern, but abundant in 
Teesdale.
Under cultivation it is not of so dwarf a character 
usually.
Occasionally plants will be seen in a fernery, where 
the soil is better suited for its growth, to attain a size double 
that of its ordinary wild character; this was very marked in 
some plants shewn to me by Mr. Swynfen Jervis, of Darlaston 
Hall, and, I understood Mr. Padley to say that the same larger 
growth had been noticed by himself with his plants at Bulwell 
Hall.
My thanks are due to Mr. Pearson, of Chilwell, for plants 
and fronds.

Apex more or less 
tufted.
Found at Bromsgrove, in.
Worcestershire, and made 
known to the public by INIr. B.
Maund.
The fronds are liable 
to vary considerably, sometimes being more tasseled, occasionally 
corymbosely-tasseled; sometimes the pinnoe scarcely divided, at 
others the pinnae and pinnules much lacerated.
Length of 
frond upwards of tv/o feet.

BoLLANDi.^, Moore.
(Fig. 188.) — Found in a hedgerow 
at Ashhurst Park, Tunbridge Wells, in 1857, by Mrs. Bolland.
Very distinct, from the great breadth of the fronds, the winged 
rachides, and large wavy pinnules.
Length of frond eighteen 
inches, ovate-lanceolate, bii^innate to the base of the pinnje, 
all the other pinnules connected by the wings of the rachides, 
membranaceous.
Pinnae broad, oblong, and stalked, not acumi- 
nate, but suddenly narrowed at the apex.
Pinnules large, 
elongate-oblong, wavy, blunt, profoundly lobcd, which are 
sparingly serrate, pointing forwards, the base narrowing and 
becoming decurrent with the membrane which borders the 
secondary rachides.
This variety has, when freshly gathered, 
the strong mignionette-like scent of the varieties ahhreviata and 
pumila.
Mr. Moore remarks that this is probably owing to 
the numerous minute glands, the fronds appearing to be 
glandular-punctate.
To JNIrs. Bolland 1 am indebted for fronds.

History of British and Exotic Ferns,") is nevertheless of 
dwarf compact habit, and an interesting addition to our hardy

Ferns.
It was found in Borrodale, Cumberland, by Mr. R.
D. Harrison.
The pinnae are opposite below and sub-opposite 
above, distant, and from an inch and a half to two inches in 
length, their apices being branched and tasseled.
The pin- 
nules are opposite.
The midrib very scaly.
Sori usually one 
on each pinnule, and in the larger and broader pinnules two, 
the whole fonning a single line close to the midvein.
Length 
of frond from twelve to eighteen inches.
The point of each 
frond, and of each of the pinniE being twice or thrice forked, 
forming a small spreading crest, renders this variety very 
interesting.
For a frond of this beautiful and rare Fern I am 
indebted to Mr. Clowes, of Windermere.

(Fig. 190.) — Found at Windermere, 
by Mr. Clowes, and in the neighbourhood of Grange in 
Furness, and Arnside, Morecambe Bay, by Mr. Monkman and 
Mr. Crossfield.
A constant variety.
Very irregular in character, 
and abnormal-looking.
Most of the pinnules very much 
narrowed, and are changed from the normal character, either 
forming brief inciso-serrate lobes along the rachis, or are 
larger and laciniate.
The fronds have a tendency to divide at 
the apex.
My thanks are due to Mr. Clowes, of Windermere, 
and to Messrs.
Stansfield, of Todmorden, for fronds.
Cristata-angustata, Moore.
(Plate XXXI — A.) — A very 
handsome and distinct form, differing from cristata, in the 
narrowness of the fronds, in being only pinnate, and the 
pinnules all confluent, so that the margins of the pinnae are 
merely shallowly lobed.
A form of Lastrea propinqiia.
The 
present variety is exceedingly distinct from the beautiful multifid 
variety known as cristata.
The frond is remarkably narrow, 
nearly linear, being only from an inch to an inch and a half 
in width.
The pinnge are crested except the upper portion of 
the frond, whilst the extreme point is tasseled.
The stem is 
covered with reddish brown scales.
Length of frond from 
twelve to eighteen inches.
This variety was raised from spores 
by Mr. R, Sim, of Foot's Cray, and has proved quite constant.
Colour a rich deep green.
My thanks are due to Mr. Edwin 
Cooling, of Milcash Nursery, Derby, for plants of this fern, 
and to Mr. R.
Sim, of Foot's Cray, and to Messrs.
Stansfield, of 
Todmorden, for fronds.
Only pinnate, the pinnules being all

confluent and very narrow, so that the edges of the pinnfe are 
merely slightly lobed, the frond seeming (as Mr. Moore justly 
remarks) "to consist only of a frill on each side of the rachis." 
The fronds arch gracefully, owing to the weight of the densely 
tufted and crispy terminal crest.
The pinnae are at the base 
semicordate and enlarged, above this they are contracted with 
a lobate-serrate margin, and terminate in crisping rounded 
tufts.
The apex of the frond elongated, and terminating in a 
very large multifid crispy tuft.

Black Park, Buckinghamshire, by Dr. AUchin; Portnell Park, 
Virginia Water, Surrey, by Mr. Thomas Moore; and in Shrop- 
shire on the Wrekin, by the Rev. W.
A. Leighton.
This 
form is somewhat similar to incisa, being finely developed, and 
having elongated pyramidal pinnules with conspicuous lobes.
Fronds three feet long, and ten inches broad.
Frond lanceo-

near the apex of the frond still triangular-elongate, but 
narrower, the base being broadest.
Pinnules elongated, but 
more deeply divided than in incisa, and their attachment to 
the rachides very narrow.
Sori usually occupying the central 
portion of the pinnules.
I am indebted to Messrs.
Stansfield,

FuRCANS, Moore.
(Fig. 192.) — A strong-growing, handsome 
form of the propinqua group, with the pinnce, rarely the 
fronds, two to three or four- cleft, constant.
Found by Mr, 
Monkman at Windermere, growing about one mile from 
Bowness, on the side of the road leading to Newby Bridge.
The type form itself also (propinqua) beautifully golden in 
colour, is there plentifully distributed, with the var.
furcans 
of the Lady fern.
The form has been found elsewhere, as 
Messrs.
Stansfield (under the name poltjdactyla) sent' Mr.
Monkman a plant of the variety some six or seven years ago.
For fronds I am indebted to Mr. Monkman.
This variety, 
which has also been found near Huddersfield by Mr. T.
Stans- 
field, and on Bookham Common, Surrey, by Mr. Stedman, 
has normal fronds, except as far as the ends of the pinnaj 
are concerned, the difference consisting in the forked character 
— mostly once, but occasionally twice and even thrice forked, 
the divisions being brief, tapering, and divergent, somewhat 
resembling a fish's tail.
Profoundly toothed.
The fish-tail like 
terminations margin the fronds in a handsome manner.

monstrous development, having every season sliown more or 
less divergence from the normal form fpaleacea.J The form 
sent was found at Castle Howard, and is a combination of 
ramosa, interrupta, depauperata, and furcans, and has no two 
fronds alike.
Occasionally the most inconceivably odd fronds 
are developed.
In the Lake district, and especially in the 
lanes about Morecambe and Lancaster, great numbers of 
Lastrea Jilix-mas similarly affected have been found; but, 
although scores have been gathered of the best marked plants 
(apparently,) I have never found any except the Castle 
Howard form to remain permanent.
There is this to notice — 
the Castle Howard group was of the paleacea type: the 
Lancashire and Lake plants were not.

The fronds are all different, but depau- 
perated so greatly in some cases as to be hardly bipinnate, 
the pinnse resembling irregularly-toothed lobes.
Quite constant, 
dwarfish, and very handsome.
For fronds my thanks are due

A strikingly distinct 
very dwarf variety.
This belongs to Lastrea propinqua.
Varying so little from the var.

Marsdenie, Loioe.
(Fig, 200.) — A most remarkable and 
distinct variety found in Yorkshire by Miss Beevor, of 
Coniston.
The pinnae are opposite below, subopposite above, 
and alternate near the apex of the frond; elongate and curving 
upwards.
Pinnules opposite, decurrent, the opposite pairs 
forming a series of cuneate based wide-spreading cups or vases 
threaded one within the other.
Minutely tridentate.
The 
basal pinnules deeper cut and not decurrent to the same extent 
as the others, and although opposite the united pair do not form 
a cuneate base.
Rarely the pinnce and pinnules are depauperate.
The two basal pairs of pinnae are more distant than the others.
This is a strikingly distinct form of the true Lastrea Jilix-mas, 
for the illustration of which I am indebted to Miss Beevor.
Length of frond thirty inches.
Stipes rich brown, and almost 
devoid of scales.

Beevorie, Lowe.
(Fig. 201.) — A very handsome Fern 
found by Miss Beevor near Coniston in the Lakes.
This 
variety is perhaps the nearest approach to Pinderii, yet 
differs in having the pinnae so close together, and the 
pinnules so large and leafy as to touch each other, except 
the basal pair of pinnae, which are a quarter of an inch 
below the next pair.
The basal pinnules of each pinna 
overlap the costa and half conceal it.
The pinna) bear a 
close resemblance to Pinderii, yet are blunter and more 
rounded at their apices, and they do not become shorter and 
smaller, as in that variety.
The stipes and rachis is densely 
clothed with scales of a rich golden brown.
The sori consist 
of a single row of spore-cases along the midrib of the pinnae, 
and are confined to the apex of the frond.
With the 
exception of the upper four or five inches, the frond is 
barren.
Length of frond thirty inches, the apex acuminate.

wardian case, and now in the possession of the Kev. Charles 
Padley, of Bulwell Hall.
It is evidently a seedling variety 
from cristata, and therefore a form of Lastrea propinqua; it 
however differs considerably from that variety.
In the form 
cristata the pinnae and pinnules are more or less normal, except 
as regards the crested tips, whilst in eulophe the whole character 
of the frond is changed, the pinnae are closer together, the 
pinnules irregularly enlarged and deeply laciniated, giving the 
frond a very leafy character, whilst not only are the apices of 
the pinnae crested, but many of the pinnae are branched, some 
near their base and others in the centre.
Stipes and rachis 
covered with rich reddish brown scales.
Length of frond about 
two feet.
Pinnae opposite below, the next three pair sub- 
opposite, the remainder being alternate, about twenty-two pairs; 
pinnules from five to nine pairs below the forked apices, various 
in form and size, sometimes laciniated, erose, or depauperated, 
mostly enlarged at their apices, more or less rounded, and 
much dentate, often bidentate.
For fronds of this extremely 
beautiful Fern my thanks are due to the Kev. Charles Padley.
This variety has been named eulophe from the Greek, on 
account of the crested character of all the pinnae.

Propinqua, Wollaston.
(Fig. J303.) — This variety, noAV 
considered as a distinct species, is described on page 234.
It 
is not so coarse-growing as the ordinary type of Lastrea jilix- 
mas, and although grovring to a large size, there is a smoothness 
in the fronds which renders it distinct and easily recognised.
From this fern most of the finest varieties have sprung.
Length 
of frond from three to five feet.

My thanks are due to the 
Rev. Charles Padley, of Bulwell Hall, for fronds.
There are 
several forms of deorso-lobata, some approaching inctsa in 
character.
It is a large Fern, and known by the enlarged 
posterior basal lobe of the pinnules -which are more or less 
inciso-lobate with the lobes serrated.
The other pinnules are 
inciso-serrate.
A form of this variety sent to me by Mr. F.
Clowes, of Windermere, is very interesting.
Many of the 
pinnae are furcate and bifurcate, and the pinnules also branched 
in an irregular manner.
The pinnules are mostly very large, 
leafy, irregular in size, many depauperate or erose, occasionally 
the costa alone, a decurrent portion without a costa, or even 
wanting altogether.
Some of the pinnae are brief, and these 
are branched from close to the stipes.
Colour vivid green.
Length of frond thirty-four inches.

This 
variety is figured on Plate XXXYII of Mr. T.
Moore's 
"Nature Printed British Ferns." The fronds and pinnae are 
multifid, crisped at the apex.
The pinnae do not narrow until 
near the crispy tassel, where they suddenly become much 
narrowed.
The pinnae are not short, as is the case in the 
variety cristata.
The pinnules are divided almost to the rachis; 
they are oblong-linear, some widened and some more or less 
acute, the edges serrated.
My thanks are due to Mr. R.

MiKRA, Lowe.
(Fig. 208.) — This Fern is known as pro- 
pinqua-cristata, but as the variety propinqua will have to be 
raised to the dignity of a species, and as the well-known variety 
Lastrea Filix-mas cristata is in reality a form of Lastrea 
propinqua, it is obvious that this name will require to be 
changed, and, from the smallness of the plant, mikra has been 
selected.
Length of frond two inches and a half; width one 
inch in the widest part.
Pinnee equal in size, except near the 
apex of the frond, where furcate and crested; pinnse alternate, 
their apices flattened out into diminutive crests.
Pinnules 
decurrent, the basal pair (which are the largest) alone divided 
almost to the costa.

The fronds grow perfectly 
erectj and promise to remain permanently dwarf.
The pinnae 
are much shortened, and contorted; but, as with the frond 
itself, show more or less the crested character of the parent 
plant.
A strange-looking plant, of which Mr. Monkman has 
modified forms, shewing less disposition to crest, but which 
are yet too young to be considered fully developed in 
character.
Paleacea type.
It is unnecessary to give an 
illustration of this variety.

Cristata, Moore.
(Plate XXVII.) — Found at Charleston, 
near St Austell, in Cornwall, and near Ilfracombe, Devonshire, 
by Mr. J.
Dodds.
The most ornamental and useful of British 
Ferns.
No Fernery can be complete without it, and it is 
impossible to grow too many plants: a mass of cristata is a 
picture to look upon.
Some years ago Mr. Henderson, of 
VVentworth, at a time when there were less than half a dozen 
collections that could boast of this lovely variety, supplied me 
with spores from which I raised several hundred plants.
The 
fronds are large, upwards of three feet in length, symmetrical 
in form, gracefully bending, largely crested, and deep green 
in colour.
Fronds narrow lanceolate.
Pinnaj brief, somewhat 
remote, narrow, and tapering from the rachis to the base of the 
crest; the crest is large, and formed of a branch of multifid 
crisped segments, every pinna is thus crested, whilst at the 
apex of the frond there is a much larger tassel, which is more 
ramose.
Pinnules oblong-obtuse, subglaucous beneath.
Rachis 
and stipes covered with golden scales.
A form of Lastrea 
pseudo-mas, W.
During the last few years many forms of this 
Fern, differing more or less from the parent, have been raised 
from spores, some of which, when their characters are more fully 
developed, will be deserving of distinctive names.

Ingramii, Moore.
(Fig. 214.) — Found in Worcestershire by 
Mr. W.
Ingram, of Croydon, and named by Mr. T.
Moore 
after the discoverer.
I have not seen the plant, and therefore 
copy Mr. Moore's description from the "Gardener's Chronicle" 
of August 8th., 1863: — *' Fronds large, being some three or 
four feet in height, and at least a foot in breadth; the 
pinnules large, averaging an inch in length, by a quarter of 
an inch in breadth, the lowest set on by a narrow base, and 
the rest becoming gradually decurrent and oblique; they are 
thus of a narrow linear-oblong form, somewhat acute, and cut 
at the margin into deepish pointed teeth, directed forwards.
The long narrow obliquely-decurrent incised pinnules give 
this Fern a very distinct and remarkable appearance.
The 
upper part of the frond only is fertile, and differs from the 
lower portion in little, excepting that the pinnules are more 
acute, more deeply incised, and a trifle smaller; the long 
narrow outlines and obliquity of insertion being still preserved.
This is one of the most striking varieties of Lastrea Jilix-mas 
of normal development which has come under my notice."

BiFORMis, Moore.
— Accidentally raised from spores by Mr.
Moore in the Botanic Gardens, Chelsea.
This variety has two 
kinds of fronds, a portion dwarf and normal, the others 
much depauperated, the pinnules very small and confluent; 
pinnaB linear, with distant minute marginal lobes, the larger 
of which are serrated.
I have not yet seen this Fern, but 
include it with Mr. Moore's description.
Latipes, Moore.
— Found at Kuthin, in Denbighshire, by 
Mr. T.

A portion two feet in length, 
ovate, coarse, the lower pinnae not shortened, scarcely bipinnate; 
pinnules oblong, overlapping, somewhat spiny serrate on the 
margin, and connected by a narrow wing.
The rest of the 
fronds larger; the pinnules large, distant, profoundly inciso- 
lobate, and much decurrent, very irregular in size and form.
The upper part of the frond fertile.
Triangularis, Moore.
— Found in Holt Wood, near Maid- 
stone, and in other parts of Kent, by Dr. Allchin.
Another 
of the incisa group, and bears a strong resemblance to Lastrea

Fronds narrow, stiflf, and somewhat erect.
Some of 
the lower pinnae unequally triangular.
Pinnules long and 
adnate, or decurrent, except the basal ones.
Paleaceo-lobata, 3Ioore.
— A handsome form found at 
Tarbet, Dumbartonshire; Penryn, Cornwall; Jersey, Guernsey, 
Ardrishiag, Argyleshire, and Glen Lochy, Perthshire.
Fronds 
very large, glaucous beneath, and bright-coloured scales.
The 
distinction consists in the margins of the pinnules being lobate 
and somewhat undulate.
An illustration is unnecessary.
Paleaceo-crispa, Moore.
— Found by Mr. R.
Hogg at Bogan 
Green, Coldingham, Berwickshire.
Fronds broad and very 
leafy; the pinnae and pinnules much crowded.
The distinction 
consists in the undulation of the pinnules, which are crispy 
from being twisted and curled.
Pinnules elongate-oblong, the 
tips acutely serrated.
All the pinnules are connected to the 
rachis by a narrow wing.

of the frond, dilated into fan-shaped fingers, hence its name; 
these niultifid apices of the pinnae largest on the basal pinna3, 
and becoming smaller towards the apex, near where not multifid, 
except the terminal pinna, which is slightly so.
Pinnules 
deeply incised and decurrent.
Length of frond two feet.
My 
thanks are due to Mr. Clapham, of Scarborough, for fronds.

PuMiLA, Moore.
(Fig. 218.) — Found on Snowdon by the 
late Mr. D.
Cameron, and more recently near Llyn Ogwen by 
Mr. S.
O. Gray.
A dwarf alpine variety, erect in habit.
Length of frond nine to twelve inches, occasionally fifteen or 
eighteen inches; stipes two or three inches in length, and 
having fimbriate scales.
Fronds lanceolate and pinnate.
Pinnae 
brief, blunt, and somewhat deflexed, profoundly pinnatifid, the 
apex recurving.
Pinnules small, oblong, obtuse, crenate, 
convex, apex recurved.
Fronds and pinnae concave.
Veins 
once forked.
Sori confined to the anterior branch of the 
lowest anterior vein, forming a single line on each side the 
midrib of the pinnae.
Fronds sweet-scented.
I am indebted 
to Mr. J.
R. Pearson, of Chilwell, near Nottingham; to Mr.
Joseph Sidebotham, of Manchester; to Sir Oswald Mosley, 
Bart., of Rolleston Hall; and to Mr. Edwin Cooling, of 
Derby, for plants.
This Fern is very distinct in habit and 
general appearance, and is separated by Mr. G.
B. Wollaston 
as a doubtful species.
Readily cultivated, and, like the form 
ahhreviata, rapidly propagates itself.
When a plant has been 
growing for four or five years it may readily be divided into 
from twelve to twenty plants, which would not be the case with 
the true forms of Lastrea jilix-mas or of Lastrea pseudo-mas.
LASTREA FILIX-MAS, 
569 
BiSERRATA, Moore.
— Found by Mr. S.
Appleby, at Rossington, 
near Doncaster.
A sub-variety of tncisa, having large, oblong, 
blunt, adnate, semi-decurrent pinnules, having serrate-crenate 
lobes, producing a conspicuous biserrate margin.
The upper 
basal pinnules deorsely-lobate.
Fig. 219.— Frond.
MoNKMANii, Loice.
(Fig. 219.) — A.
curious monstrosity, 
found by Mr. C.
Monkman, of Malton, in 1863, growing from 
beneath the platform at the Hornby railway station, near 
Lancaster.
The pinnae are extremely abbreviated, scarcely bi- 
pinnate, many being mere lobes.
Every part of the plant is 
remarkably irregular.
The pinnae are very coriaceous, and 
papillose, some marginate; giving to the fronds a peculiarly 
rough aspect.
So far there is no sign of fertility.
When

LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
found the previous year's fronds were still attached, and were 
equally as curious as the one illustrated.
Mr. Monkman has 
no doubt of the permanency of this curiosity, and reports the 
plant as being healthy.
Fig. 220.
Polydactyla-Bloxamii, Lowe.
(Fig. 220.) — Mr. Wollaston 
has furnished me with information of several subforms of 
cristata.
One found near Tenby in South Wales, and brought 
into notice by Mr. E.
Bloxam, of Eltham, Kent.
It is a very 
beautiful and symmetrical polydactylous form, perfectly normal 
in all its parts, except that the apices both of the frond and 
pinnaj are many-fingered or hand-shaped.
It might be dis- 
tinguished by the name polydactyla-Bloxamii.
My thanks are 
due to Mr. R.
Bloxam for the illustration.
Another found 
near Petersfield, Hampshire, by Mr. G, B.
Wollaston, is one 
of the subcristate forms, connecting the normal form, through 
the polydactylous, with the truly cristate varieties of the 
species.
It is of the ordinary type, but having in all its 
parts the germs of cristation, even to the pinnules.
The 
autumnal is generally more developed than the spring growth, 
which is sometimes perfectly normal; it might be distinguished 
as subcristata.
Another found by Mr. Swynfen Jervis in 
Drumble Lane, near Darlaston Hall, Staffordshire, is another 
subcristate variety, difiering only from the last in being less 
multifid, and being of rather attenuated growth.
A fourth 
subcristate variety was found at Uckfield, Sussex, by Mr.
LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
271 
G. B.
WoUaston, who remarks that it has not been sufficiently 
long in cultivation to speak of its merits, hut it appears to he 
the least cristate variety yet found, and yet has sufficient 
characters to shew that under certain conditions it will be 
dichotomous in its principal members, namely, the apices of 
the frond and pinna?.
Fig. 221.
Atro-viridis, Jertis.
(Fig. 221.) — Mr. Swynfen Jervis, who 
was the finder of this variety in Staffordshire, feels very 
doubtful whether it be a variety of Lastrea Jilix-mas.
Its 
coriaceous structure and permanently dark and subevergreen 
habit is strong proof that it is not so; but Mr. G.
B. 
Wollaston, who has taken great notice of this form is of a 
different opinion.
It is a fine, robust, and symmetrical variety 
with sub-bipinnate fronds, scarcely ever attaining a length of 
eighteen inches.
The lobes subimbricate, rounded, and larger 
at the summit than the base.
Its general appearance is 
intermediate between Lastrea Jiliz-mas and Lastrea pseudo-mas, 
Wollaston.
Paleacea, Moore.
— This is Lastrea pseudo-mas of Wollaston, 
described on page 253; there are several varieties too nearly 
allied to the normal form to be described.
The most compact 
form is found about Ambleside, and in many places in 
the lake district, as well as at Chaigeley Manor, Lancashire, 
and Matlock, Derbyshire.
This I have figured under the 
original name.
The pinna?
are shorter, and broader for their 
length, approximate, the pinnules are also approximate.
There 
is a marked difference between this form and the normal form 
272 
LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
of Lasfrea filix-mas.
In the Fernery of Mr. W.
Winstanley, 
at Chaigeley Manor, there are fine examples of both these 
Ferns; the latter had fronds from six to seven feet in length, 
lax; the former did not exceed four feet, and were compact, and 
not so coarse in general appearance.
Mr. Winstanley shewed 
me both these forms growing in abundance on various portions 
of his estate, through a range of several hundred feet of 
elevation, the most luxuriant being in the woods along the 
Kiver Hodder.
Fig. 222.— Pinnae.
Barnsii, Moore, {Carta, Wollaston.) (Fig. 222.)— A very 
narrow variety, found in Lancashire by Mr. T.
M. Barnes, 
of Levens, near Milnthorpe, Lancashire.
A narrow-fronded 
variety, in which the pinna are brief, distant and subopposite 
below, approximate and alternate above.
Length of frond 
fifteen inches; breadth almost equal, narrowing slightly towards 
the base and towards the apex, and being only two inches 
and a half wide in the widest part, that is, in the middle of 
the frond.
Pinnae brief, elongate-triangular, and one inch and 
a quarter in length, and three quarters of an inch wide, about 
fifteen pairs on each frond.
Pinnules ovate-oblong, the basal 
pair slightly stalked, the next two pairs widely attached to 
the rachides, and the remainder attached throughout their 
breadth, broad, leafy, touching each other, and bidentate on 
the margin.
Stipes and rachis rather scaly.
The lower four 
inches naked.
Mr. Wollaston's name is very appropriate, yet 
Mr. Moore's takes precedence, and, as named after the dis- 
coverer, is equally appropriate.
My thanks are due to Mr.
Thomas Moore, of the Chelsea Botanic Gardens, for fronds.

(Fig. 223.) — Found near Swansea, in South 
Wales, in September, 1857, by Mr. Frederick J.
Clouston Scott.
A singular leafy variety, with pinnns close set and overwrapping 
each other, opposite below and alternate above.
Length of 
frond fifteen inches, breadth five.
One half of the pinnae are 
branched, and all more or less irregular, some only consisting

of a single lobe; usually tlie branching pinnse bave three pairs 
of opposite pinnules below the branching, the other pinnae 
have only the basal pair opposite, the remainder being 
alternate.
The basal pinnules are deeply cut and irregular in 
shape, the others being merely strongly bidentate.
The apex 
of the frond is also branched.
My thanks are due to Mr.
Scott for fronds.

The 
pinnae are also beautifully crested, and occasionally the pinnules 
or the lobes of the same.
In other respects the variety is 
normal.

narrowing to very minute pointed lobes near the apex, and 
then widening out into a large crested tuft.
The frond also 
branching and tufted at the apex.
On one side the frond, 
from its centre to the apex, are either almost wanting or 
very brief, narrow, and branching pinnae or pinnules.
Length 
of frond twelve inches, of which the basal inch and a half 
is naked.
Stipes and rachis copiously hirsute.
LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
277 
Inciso-kecurva, J/oorc— Found in 1857, by Mr. S.
Appleby, 
near Doncaster.
A sub-variety, with pinnse and pinnules 
recurved, which distinguishes it from its otherwise near allies 
incisa and deorso-lobata.
Fig. 227.— Frond.
Lacerato-cristata, Monkman.
(Fig. 227.) — This oddity is 
a sport from spores of the variety cristata, raised by Mr. C.
Monkman, of Malton, who is of opinion that the variety will 
remain permanently dwarf, and it is promising to be constant.
The parentage is unmistakeable, but the pinnae are variously 
shortened and wanting, and in place of pinnulets are deeply 
incised into irregularly lobed divisions, which shew some 
tendency to crest.
The pinnae and the fronds are sometimes 
crested, but not always distinctly so, and occasionally not at 
all.
So far there has been no indication of fertility.
Fronds 
six to eight inches in length.
The illustration is from Mr.
Monkman's plant — the only one known.

278 LASTREA FILIX-MASr.
GiGANTEA, Loive.
— Found near Marwood, Devonshire, by 
the Rev. F, Mules.
Normal in form, and gigantic in size.
Length of fronds fifty inches, width ten inches.
The pinnae 
very close together, ascending, and therefore making the frond 
narrow, the pinnae being eight inches in length, and one inch 
and a quarter wide at the base.
The frond nearly equal in 
width, slightly narrowing at the base, where eight wide, 
and rapidly narrowing at the apex.
Stipes and rachis 
densely scaly; the base of the stem an inch in diameter, and 
at nine inches above the base half an inch, densely clothed 
with rich reddish brown scales, so thick as to make the stem 
appear an inch and a half in diameter.
The pinnce commence 
six inches above the base.
The upper thirty-four inches 
entirely covered on the under side of the frond with spore- 
cases from the base to the apex of the pinnae.
The lower 
half of the pinnse having from ten to twelve spore-cases on 
each pinnule, the central pinnae having from two hundred and 
ten to two hundred and twenty spore-cases on each, which 
are large in size, and very prominent.
Pinnae attenuated into 
a sharp point.
Pinnules long, with a rounded apex; the 
edges smooth and entire, except the rounded apex, which is 
slio'htly dentate; the pinnules are copiously scaly on the under 
side of the frond, and extending beyond the margin as a 
fringe of narrow hair-like scales.
It is unnecessary to give 
an illustration.
My thanks are due to the Rev. F.
Mules for 
fronds.
Flexuosa, Moore.
— Found by Mr. S.
Appleby, near Doncaster.
A sub-variety of deorso-lohata, differing in the main-rachis 
being curiously and strongly twisted in a zigzag manner, the 
secondary rachides being also tortuously curved.
Cri&pata, Wollaston.
— Perfectly normal, except that it is 
erispy-waved in every part of the frond.

species.
All its parts are diminutive, the teeth of the lobes 
remarkably soj but ia other respects its growth is of the 
ordinary size.
Mapplebegkii, Lowe.
— Found in two places near Grasmere, 
in the English Lake District, by Mr. J.
E. Mapplebeck, of 
Bromsgrove, in August, 1862.
The fronds are twelve inches 
or more in length, polydactylous, and fork into two distinct 
fronds near the base, and frequently the basal pinnae are 
divided in the same manner.
The apex of the pinnse cristate, 
as -well as the apex of the frond.
My thanks are due to Mr.
Mapplebeck for fronds.
Fig. 228.— Pinnte.
WiNSTAXLEYi, Loioe.
(Fig. 228.) — Raised from spores at 
Highfield House from cristata, yet differing from that variety 
in several respects.
The fronds are long and narrow — twenty 
inches in length, and only three inches and a half in width; 
slightly widest in the middle, narrowing rapidly to the apex, 
and slightly to the base; the apex of the frond is furcate and 
cristate.
It differs from cristata in having a tufted crest, 
which forms a compact rounded head, all the margins of 
which are deeply cut.
The pinnee are close, alternate, and 
narrow, being widest at the base.
Pinnate, the segments being 
deeply cut near the base, the basal inferior lobe being the 
largest.
The margins of the lobes finely dentate.
Sori confined 
to the upper half of the frond, a single row on either side 
the midrib, and much smaller in size than in cristata.
The 
pinnae near the base of the frond are dilate, much branched, 
but not tufted; and only shew a tendency to be cristate.
An 
elegant and more slender form.

LASTREA FILTX-MAS.
Before describing tlie varieties of Lastrea filix-mas we men- 
tioned that Mr. Wollaston had divided this Fern into three 
species, and as we figured and described the varieties, reference 
was made regarding the species to which they belonged.
Mr.
Wollaston has bestowed great care and attention to this subject, 
and his labours will be best understood by recapitulation, 
especially as he informs me that I have made several errors 
with regard to his new species; thus ahbreviata is Lastrea 
propinqua and not Lastrea pseudo-mas; cristata-angustata and 
Pinderi are, however, forms of Lastrea pseudo-mas instead of 
Lastrea propinqua.
The following arrangement will clear up 
this difficulty.

LASTREA FILIX-MAS.
281 
Mr. Wollaston has studied Lastrea Jilix-mas more than any 
one, and moreover is an authority in which we must put 
confidence; we have therefore fallen in with his views, 
although some of our authorities will not agree with this new 
division of a British species, whilst others go even further 
and say that even Lastrea cristata and Lastrea csmula are 
only forms of Lastrea jilix-mas.
KECAPITULATION.
Prodtjcta.
— Mr. Elworthy has found this variety near !N'ettlecombe.
Length of frond twenty-six inches, width eight inches; pinnse ascending, 
(the longest as much as five inches,) widest in the middle of the frond; 
pinnae short and horizontal at the base.
Stipes five inches, covered 
with pale brown scales.
Sori copious on the upper half only of the 
frond.
Eamosa, Stansfield.
— A curious branching variety, with various formed 
pinnae and very large pinnules, thin in texture, and vividly green in 
colour.
The pinnules near the base are deeply divided, and those near 
the apex shallowly, strongly dentate.
Length of frond twelve inches.
The branched apex ascending, the branches overcrossing each other.
ScnoFiELDii, Moore, {Minima, Wollaston.) — We have described this 
beautiful pigmy variety at page 266.
It was formerly considered a 
variety both of Lastrea sj>itiulosa and Lastrea dilatata.
FuRCANS, Moore.
— There is a sub-variety of furcans, in which the 
furcations are wide spread, being almost at right angles to the pinna, 
and somewhat resemble the horns of a cow.
PoLTDACTTLA, MooTC.
— Also found at Eedditch, in 1860, by Mr. Gold, 
fronds of which have been forwarded by Mr. Mapplebeck.

Mingrelia; in Africa in the Azores and Bourbon; whilst in 
Europe it is generally distributed in Lapland, Norway, Spain, 
Portugal, Alps, Italy, Croatia, Transylvania, France, Germany, 
and Switzerland.
In some parts of Northern Spain it is not uncommon.
I found 
it occurring in the Hoz de Barcena; at Las Caldas; and between 
Las Caldas and the entrance to the Hoz de Barcena associated 
with Woodicardia radicans and Adiantum capillus-tenerts, and 
2 p- 
286 LASTREA DILATATA, 
most abundant between Reinosa and Allar, on one of the spurs 
of the Pyrenees, known by tbe name of the Villia Escusa, 
here it spread its branches over the chasms on the rocks, and 
afforded shelter to the numerous wolves that inhabit these 
mountains.
It is also said to be a native of New Zealand.
A plant requiring no skill in its cultivation, preferring 
a shady situation and decayed leaves, yet growing well in any 
kind of soil.
In woods of some years standing, where the 
subsoil is a cold clay, the roots spread themselves in the 
decaying leaves close to the surface, so that the plants can be 
removed by merely pulling at the fronds, under such circum- 
stances they seem more especially to delight.
In wet situations 
five or six hundred feet above the sea, they grow in more 
exposed situations, as amongst the grass in the fields along 
Longridge Fell, between Preston and Clitheroe; here I found 
them much more stunted in growth, the fronds almost cuneate, 
more rigid, recurved, and richer in the green colour of the 
fronds.
A very handsome subevergreen Fernery plant.
Very prolific in varieties, some of which are exceedingly 
distinct.
Included in this species are several forms that will eventually 
be raised to the dignity of species.
We have the normal form, 
sjnnulosa, uliginosa, collina, glandulosa, and others all strikingly 
different, and amongst these uliginosa and another very similar 
variety can hardly be said to be varieties of L.
dilatata.
I 
would have considered uliginosa and another form closely 
resembling it as forms of the same Fern, yet one is always 
found growing in boggy situations, associated with Lastrea 
cristata and L.
oreopteris ; whilst the other is found in dry 
woods, where these two species could not exist; then again 
on removing these plants to a Fernery, if the one found in 
boggy places is planted high and dry, it soon dwindles away 
in the same manner as Lastrea cristata; whilst the other is 
equally unfortunate if planted in situations favourable to 
Lastrea cristata.
I am quite convinced that however much Lastrea uliginosa 
and Lastrea spinulosa agree with Lastrea cristata, they do not 
belong to that species.
I have watched these plants in various 
places, and living near Oxton Bog, a well-known locality for 
LASTREA DILATATA.
287 
Lastrea cristata, my attention has been specially directed to 
these plants, and the conclusion arrived at is that they cannot 
be grouped with each other.
The other similar form is a 
Avide-spread Fern, but always found in woods growing in 
similar situations to those suitable to Lastrea dilatata, but 
unlike that species, sending its roots perpendicularly down into 
the subsoil, it is always upright in growth, and having very 
long naked stems.
I have seen it in woods at Bulwell and 
AVollaton, in Nottinghamshire; in the lake district; near High- 
force, in Durham; at Chaigeley Manor and Browsholme Hall, 
Lancashire; and at Matlock, in Derbyshire, yet in no place 
have I found it where Lastrea cristata grows.
Then again, 
Lastrea • spinulosa has often been associated with Lastrea 
dilatata, and some growers have even affirmed that the pinnae 
and pinnules of the former have in course of time expanded 
into similar ones to those of the latter.
Plants in my Fernery, 
ten and fifteen years old, have never altered their character.
Provisionally, however, we will group all these Ferns under 
Lastrea dilatata, yet with a firm conviction that they cannot 
long remain united.
After describing the varieties we may return to the subject.
The normal form occurs at every elevation from the sea 
level to more than three thousand six hundred feet in height.
The fronds vary from twelve inches to six feet in length, 
and from four to eighteen inches in breadth.
Spreading, and 
usually drooping; ovate, or ovate-lanceolate in form, and 
bipinnate or tripinnate.
Pinnce distant below, becoming more 
approximate upwards; numerous, and opposite or subopposite.
The basal pair are obliquely-triangular elongate, the posterior 
much larger than the anterior.
Pinnules ovate-oblong, the basal ones stalked, the upper 
ones sessile and decurrent, all the divisions are sharply dentate, 
and terminating in a bristle-like point.
Veins branching.
Fructification occupying the whole underside of the frond.
Stipes terminal, and adherent to the caudex, variable in 
length, very thick at the base, and densely scaly.
Rachis 
convex behind, and channeled in front.
Caudex stout, and mostly erect.

A pretty Fern with diverse fronds.
Length of frond from

depauperated, many of the basal pinnae are depauperated, some 
only of the size of pinnules having incised margins, others 
very brief with much smaller pinnules, not unfrequently 
consisting only of a few lobe-like teeth.
The pinnules very 
diverse, some oblong, with acuminate lobatc-serrate teeth.

I found plants near Longridge Fell, Lancashire, 
and several plants in an alder wood at Chaigeley Manor.
In 
this wood I found several hundred specimens of the Clausilia 
laminata, and quantities of Azea tridens, Balea fragilis, 
Zua lubrica, Pupa pusilla, Pupa umhilicata, Vitnna pellucida, 
Arion Jlatus, Avion hortcnsis, Zonites cellarius, and other 
conchological species.
I name this to shew that *^two birds 
could be killed with one stone," at least very often: conchology 
and botany can very well be worked together.
Fronds 
bipinnate, and dwarf, seldom exceeding twelve inches in length; 
of a lengthened triangular-ovate form, very glandular on the 
rachides, stipites and lower surface of the veins.

surface in a hair-like white line, giving a falsely strigose 
appearance.
A similar form has been found in Monkland 
LASTREA DILATATA.

Interrupta, Moare.
(Fig. 233.) — Found near Harrogate, 
Yorkshire, by Mr. Clapham, of Scarborough.
The fronds are 
lanceolate-ovate in form, of medium size, and of irregular 
development; occasionally ramose as well as interrupted; the 
pinnae are sometimes wanting, or reduced to less than half their 
usual length, the pinnules being irregularly incised or laciniated 
on the margin, occasionally more or less normal.
Subsequently

and near Malton.
Mr. Monkman remarks that "the plants 
were large and handsome.
The pinnules irregularly shortened 
or wanting; sometimes a mere horn-like midrib, devoid of foliage, 
projecting."

PiGMJEA, Moore.
(Fig. 234.) — Found in Cant Clough, in 
the beautiful vale of Todmorden, Lancashire, by Mr. Stansfield, 
of Vale Nursery, Todmorden.
A very dwarf form having 
the pinnte scarcely bipinnate, the basal pinnules at the base 
of the frond being divided, the others irregularly confluent; 
having crowded lobes of various forms, and with unequal 
serratures which terminate in a bristle.
Its main peculiarity 
consists in the rachis or stipes being ramose.
A singularly

(Plate XXXIII.) — Said to be found in 
Yorkshire, but its history obscure.
^Ir. Tait, of Edinburgh, 
brought it under notice, having procured it from Mr. Stark, 
a Nurseryman of that city.
Singularly distinct, dwarf, and 
having much-divided fronds.
Fronds quadripinnate, very 
broadly ovate; length about eighteen inches.
Pinnae everywhere 
very unequal, the posterior ones much the largest.
Pinnules 
small and distinct, the primary pinnules elongate-ovate and 
distant on the rachides, and pinnate.
The secondary pinnules 
also distant, blunt, brief ovate, having a tapering stalk-like 
base; below they are divided into broad lobes, being tertiary 
pinnules on the basal posterior pinnule of the basal pinna.
The ultimate divisions are small.
Densely scaly, with large, 
entire, lepidote, brown scales.
Mr. Moore remarks a striking 
peculiarity in the development of the fronds, the evolution of 
the fronds being indefinite, for the basal pinnules of a pinna 
have matured and scattered their sori before the apex of the 
same pinna has expanded itself or become unrolled.
I am 
indebted to Mr. Cooling, of Derby, for plants.

Yorkshire and Lancashire.
This form is rather larger than the 
variety concinna, having the pinnae, as well as the pinnules, 
more distant.
The pinnules are also more ohtuse, and their 
lobes more widely apart.
This is a slender form, having 
sharply toothed lobes.
The fronds, including the stipes, exceed 
eighteen inches in length.

Cristata, Moore.
(Fig. 237.) — Found near Doncaster by 
Mr. Appleby, and brought under general notice by Mr. R.
Sim, of Foot's Cray.
A distinct crested variety, with somewhat 
dwarf habit.
The pinnae are usually twice forked into brief 
bluntly spread segments, terminating in a slightly crisped tuft 
as well as the apex of the frond.
All the pinn® are not 
regularly crested, but where not so they are dilate, showing a 
tendency to fork.
When the plant becomes older it will no

A much more crested 
variety was found in Devonshire by the late Mr. C.
Jackson, 
which is now in the possession of Mr. G.
B. ^VoUaston, of 
Chiselhurst.
Subsequently Mrs. Thompson, of Exeter, found a 
crested variety in Devonshire, which assumes this form in a 
marked degree.
My thanks are due to Mr. R.
Sim, of Foot's

Ramos A, Mooi'e.
(Fig. 238.) — Apparently a ramose form of

Usually twin-fronded, but sometimes each twin- 
frond again divided, forming a large variously-branched flabellate 
mass of foliage, and is in that state very remarkable.
Copiously 
fertile, and moderately constant.
Mr. Monkman's plant, from 
which the illustration is given, was received from Messrs.

LASTREA DILATATA.
Stansfield, of Todmorden.
Mr. Monkman has found this variety, 
more than any other, to be liable to the attacks of the green 
fly, which, if not closely watched, quickly destroys the foliage.
In a Malton atmosphere the variety is only semi-persistent.
A 
very fine and really interesting Fern.
A Scottish form.
The 
stipes and rachis forked, so as to produce a branched frond.

Glandulosa, Moore.
(Fig. 239.) — First discovered in a 
boggy portion of Ankerbury Hill, near Lydbrook, in the Forest 
of Dean, Gloucestershire, and subsequently near Windermere 
by Mr. F.
Clowes; near Linley, Broseley, Shropshire, by Mr.
G. Maw; at Barnes, Surrey, by Mr, T.
Moore; at Hastings by 
Mr. J.
Stidolph; and in Epping Forest, Essex, by Mr. H.
Doubleday.
A large-growing, almost erect-habited form, with 
tall robust fronds, not unlike a large and broad spinulosa, yet 
diifering in having the scales on the stipes more lanceolate in 
form and two-coloured, and in the indusia which covers the 
spore-cases being glandular fringed.
Caudex somewhat creeping.
The stipes varying from one third to one half the length of 
the entire frond, scaly, thickly so near the base, and sparingly 
upwards.
The stipites, rachides, and under surface of the 
fronds covered thickly with stalked glands.
Length of fronds 
from twenty-four to forty-eight inches, oblong-lanceolate in form 
in the fully-developed fronds.
Tripinnate below, bipinnate 
above.
Pinnae ascending, and twisted almost horizontally, the 
lower ones unequally deltoid and wide, above lanceolate-ovate, 
two inches broad near the base, and six inches in the longest.
LASTREA DILATATA.
297 
Pinnules usually an inch in length, the posterior pinnules on 
the basal pinna as much as an inch and three quarters, lanceolate- 
ovate and acute.
The basal ones stalked, above these decurrent, 
then adnate, and towards the apex confluent.
Pinnules pinnatifid 
almost to the mid vein; lobes oblong, adnate, cut or dentate, all 
the serratures terminating in a bristle-like point.
Fructification 
extending over the whole frond.
Somewhat similar varieties 
have been found in various places, which are all glandular, 
yet have more or less difference from the original normal form.
I am indebted to Mr. F.

HowARDTJ, Monhnan.
(Figs.
241, 242, 243.)— This is the 
most remarkahle form of dilatata yet discovered; indeed it 
may be said to present an entirely new arrangement hitherto 
without parallel in the British Filices.
In no other species, 
excepting perhaps in Athyrium Filix-foGmina var.
FieldicB and 
Polystichum angulare var.
Elworthii, has any approach to this 
peculiarity of development been observed.
And in the case of 
FieldicB, a whole frond is requisite to give an idea of each separate 
pinna of llowardii, therefore the peculiarities of the latter may 
LASTREA DTI.ATATA.
299 
be regarded as entirely new.
The variety was found in July, 
1863, by Mr, C.
Monkman, of Malton, and also by Mr. Stabler, 
of Levens, Milnthorpe, and accidentally by one of Lord 
Carlisle's labourers, growing luxuriantly in the Raywood, closely 
contiguous to his Lordship's Yorkshire seat.
Castle Howard.
In all six vigorovis plants were found, and as they are exclusively 
in the hands of collectors, some time must elapse before the 
variety is at all common.
• One half the find is held by Mr.
Monkman and Mr. Clapham, and the rest went to Mr. Barnes, 
at Milnthorpe.
Plants stout growing, as in the species; the 
outlines of the fronds present a contracted appearance towards 
the apices, which are lengthened caudately, resembling a pinna.
The basal pinnae are normal, becoming, as they ascend, 
curiously dwarfed and transformed, as follows: — pinnules, 
excepting the basal ones, dwarfed and irregularly palmately 
branched into three, four, or five short divisions, which, 
according to their size, resemble small pinnules or pinnulets, 
and are finely and continuously toothed.
The arrangement 
of the pinnules has the peculiar cruciate form, which renders 
a pinna of Hoicardii so much like the whole frond of 
Athyrium Filix-fcemina var.
Fieldice.
Fructification copious, 
but, so far, there has not been time to test the reproductibility 
of the variety from spores, and certain very small off'-sets from 
the old plants are yet indisposed to sport, showing no departure 
from the normal frond.
However, as six very large crowns 
were found, and growing some yards distant from one another, 
and as all the fronds, -without exception, are alike marked, 
there can be no doubt as to the permanency of the variety.
The 
name Hoicardii was given in compliment to the Earl of Carlisle, 
and in acknowledgment of the interest his Lordship has taken 
in the Ferns of the Castle Howard district.
It is apparently 
a form of the variety micromera.
Quite unique in character, 
and a most remarkable Fern.
The pinnae, with their transformed 
forked pinnules, bear a strong resemblance in character to the 
small fronds of the oddly-shaped Athyrium filix-fcemina^ variety 
Fieldice, and Polystichum angidare, var.
Elworthii.
Mr.
!Moore 
is of opinion that the plant belongs to the elegantly small 
pinnuled type or division of Lastrea dilatata, to which it has 
been proposed to apply the name micromera.
The illustrations 
are from fronds sent by Mr. Monkman.

apices terminating in a dilated bifid or trifid dentation, in the 
larger ones the sides are also dentate.
Although this Fern is 
known as Mr. Elworthy's form of erosa, the fronds which I 
have seen are not sufficiently erose for its name.

breadth four to five inches; outline of frond ovate-lanceolate or 
subtriangular ; pinnae strap-shaped, blunt; pinnules bluntly-ovate, 
mostly biserrate, thick, leathery, recurved.
The characteristic 
difference of this variety is the crisping or recurving of the 
pinnules, which are of a thick, leathery texture, and so abun- 
dantly glandular as to give almost a horny aspect to the frond.
My thanks are due to Messrs.

the pinnules narrower.
Length of frond twelve inches, width 
scarcely three inches, 
Blakei, Moore.
— Found near Aberdeen, and named after 
the discoverer Mr. James Blake.
A most striking Fern.
Tall, 
and upright in its habit, not unlike the variety alta, and 
evidently a depauperated form of that Fern.
The whole frond 
is affected with irregular development.
Mr. Moore remarks 
324 
J.ASTREA DILATATA, 
"this is so completely the case with Blakei, that the frond 
becomes symmetrically unsymmetrical, if such a paradox can 
be conceived." The form Blakei has also a tall, oblong outline, 
which is another peculiarity.
Doubtfully distinct from angusti- 
pinnula.

There has been great diversity of opinion as regards this 
Fern.
Mr. Xewman figured it in the "Phytologist" as a distinct 
species first as Lastrea uliginosa, and then as Lophodium uligino- 
sum.
Mr. Moore places it as the variety uliginosa of Lastrea 
cristata; and in Hooker and Arnott's "British Flora" it is also 
placed under this Fern, as Aspidium cristatum, var.
uliginosum/ 
and Mr. Braun calls it Aspidium spinulosum, var.
uliginosum.
This Fern and spinulosa seem to me to be distinct species.
2 U 
326 LASTREA ULIGINOSA.
Found at Oxton Bog, NottinghamsTiire, by myself; also at 
Wybunbury Bog, Cheshire; near Malton, Yorkshire, by Mr.
C. Monkman; Bawsey Heath, Wymondham Broad, and 
Sur] Ingham, Norfolk; Newcastle-under-Lyne, Staffordshire; 
Broseley, Shropshire.
In Ireland at Killarney, and in Glen 
Flesk, near Kenmare, Kerry.
Caudex stout and decumbent.
Fronds erect, linear-lanceolate 
in form.
Height from twenty-four to fifty inches; bipinnate at 
the base of the pinnse.
Fronds of three kinds.
The first fronds fertile, quite erect 
in growth, bipinnate; the basal pinnules distinct; pinnae 
stalked, the upper surface turning towards the apex of the 
frond.
The second kind shorter and barren, small, spreading, 
pinnate; pinnules oblong-obtuse and decurrent.
The third 
kind are produced later in the season, are sometimes barren 
and sometimes fertile, the pinnules being broader and blunter, 
and decurrent.
Pinnae elongate-triangular, the lower ones broader, shorter, 
and more oblique than those above them.
The basal posterior pinnule is an inch in length, and the 
basal anterior pinnule three quarters of an inch; in the 
middle of the frond the basal pinnules are distinct, oblong, 
acute, pinnatifidly lobed, the lobes having long, spinulose, or 
aristate teeth; the upper pinnules adnate, and sharply and 
profoundly serrate.
Fructification most copious towards the apex of the frond.
This Fern differs from Lastrea cristata in having in the 
earlier fertile fronds more acute pinnules, and in being more 
copiously lobed and toothed.
Some few years ago I found it abundant on Oxton Bogs, and 
in 1864 as a common plant at Browsholme Hall, the seat of 
Capt.
Parker.
At Oxton it has promise of being preserved, as 
the present proprietor, Mr. Henry Sherbrooke, is taking care 
that it and Lastrea cristata shall not be destroyed.
Mr. Monk- 
man, of Malton, remarks that it grows with cristata in the Malton 
district, also plentifully at Castle Howard, (but here there is not 
cristata.) In 1857 Mr. Monkman found uliginosa growing with 
Osmunda regalis on the west side of Derwent Water, near Kes- 
wick.
There were amongst them a few depauperated plants, but 
he is not aware whether these will prove permanent varieties.

A VERY beautiful Fern apparently distinct from Lastrea 
dilatata.
This is one of the scented Ferns, the fronds giving 
out a fragrance like newly-mown hay.
The fronds, which are triangular-ovate, sometimes quite 
triangular, are tripinnate, having concave pinnules, and on 
this account it is sometimes called the "Concave Buckler 
Fern." Scales of the stipes whole coloured, narrow lance-shaped 
in form, and laciniate or fimbriate on the margin, frequently 
contorted.
The pinnulets are pinnatifid, the lobes mucronately 
serrate, and curving upwards.
The indusium has minute sessile glands on the margin.
The caudex thick and copiously scaly.
The stipes is usually about half the length of the whole 
frond, rigid, somewhat stout, and purplish brown in colour.
Copiously scaly.
Rachis greenish, and less scaly.
Rachis, stipes, and secondary rachides bearing many small, 
sessile, spherical glands.
Fronds numerous.
Height from twelve to twenty-four 
inches, breadth from five to eight inches.
Colour rich bright 
green, paler beneath.
Elongate-triangular, tripinnate, the 
upper surface crispy.
Pinnae opposite or subopposite.
Broadly and unequally 
deltoid.
Pinnules in the anterior side less than those on the posterior 
side.
Profoundly pinnatifid, the lobes oblong and serrated.
The basal pinnae, pinnules, and pinnulets stalked.
The margins of the pinnules and lobes mucronately toothed, 
the margins turning upwards from the drooping fronds so that 
all the divisions are concave, giving the whole frond an elegant 
crispy appearance.
Fructification occupying the whole under surface of the frond.
LASTREA iEMULA.
333 
Sori numerous, circular, and indusiate, forming two rows 
along the pinnules and pinnulets, situated near the midvein, 
and eventually becoming confluent.
Indusium uniform, having 
a jagged uneven margin.
Found in many parts of Cornwall and Devonshire.
In 
Somersetshire, Sussex, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Yorkshire, 
Lancashire, Cumberland, Northumberland, Glamorganshire, 
Pembrokeshire, Anglesea, Merionethshire, Carnarvonshire, 
Forfarshire, Dumbartonshire, Argyleshire, Inverness-shire, Isles 
of Arran, Mull, Xorth Uist, Orkney, and Guernsey.
In Ireland 
in Antrim, Londonderry, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Gal way, 
Wicklow, "Waterford, Clare, Cork, and Kerry.
Abroad it is a native of the Azores, Madeira, and Cape de 
Verd Isles.
A Fern easily cultivated in a porous soil of loam, peat, and 
sand.
I am indebted to the Rev. F.
Mules, for fronds from Marwood, 
Devonshire; also to Mr. C Monkman, for others from Hackness; 
and to the late Dr. J.
R. Kinahan, for others from Foxe's Cove.
In 1862 I visited the woods above Hackness, where I 
found this Fern growing in the greatest profusion, yet only 
near the summits of these hilly plantations.
It appeared to 
delight in these shady rocky situations.
This species is not given to much variety from the normal 
form, the following, however, may be mentioned: — 
Angustipixnula, Moore.
— Found near Cushendall, in Antrim, 
by Mr. D.
Moore, of the Glasnevin Gardens.
The peculiarity 
consists in the secondary pinnules being more confluent, the 
lobes irregularly shortened, and the teeth more evidently aristate.
Interrupta, Clapham.—Y oundi at Hackness by Mr. Clapham, 
of Scarborough.
Fronds variously depauperated, the pinnae and 
pinnules (more frequently the latter) shortened and mis-shapened.
Ramosa, Clapham.
— Found at Hackness, about the year 
1858, by Mr. Clapham, of Scarborough.
The peculiarity of 
this variety is having twin fronds attached or joined together 
at the base.

LASTREA FILIX-MAS, Var. Depauperata.
WOLLASTON.
PLATE I.* — FRONTISPIECE.
This remarkable depauperate variety, which is quite distinct, 
and a very fine form, was found in the parish of West 
Buckland, North Devon, and was brought to notice by the 
Rev. C.
Padley, M.A., of Beaconfield House, near Plymouth.
It is now in the possession of Mr. G.
B. Wollaston, of 
Chiselhurst.
It is a barren variety, of dwarf habit.
The fronds are vividly green in colour.
My thanks are due to the Rev. Charles Padley for the 
illustration.
