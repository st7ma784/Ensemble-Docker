PREFACE.
The Knoll Ambleside, 
March 12th, 1855.
It is now some months since I com- 
mitted the manuscript of this Lake Guide 
to the publisher's hands; and now that 
the work is just ready to appear, I am 
thankful to him for the opportunity of 
saying, in this prefatory page, with what 
pride and pleasure I have looked over 
the accessories and embellishments with 
which, by his zeal and spirit, and by the 
admirable cooperation he has been so 
fortunate as to secure, my humble work 
is elevated to a quality of real importance.

PREFACE.
When I look at Mr. Ruthven's valuable 
geological Map, Mr. Aspland's beautiful 
illustrative Views, so finely engraved by 
Mr. Banks; and, again, the Botanical 
contributions, so essential to the perfect 
understanding of the Lake District, it 
seems to me that the book has become, 
by all this aid, one which may not only 
be in every tourist's hands, but find a 
place on the library shelves of those who 
have never visited, and may not contem- 
plate visiting, this district of England.
At the same time, the Directories, (a new 
feature in a Guide Book) are likely to 
make it valuable to residents, who need 
no guide to the scenery near their homes.
If my gratitude to my coadjutors causes 
me to overrate the product of our labours, 
I shall not at least be mistaken in saying 
that we have all done our best to set forth 
a true presentment of a land we love, in 
the hope of inducing and enabling those

who live in town or plain to know and 
love it as we do.
If any think that we 
have painted it too fair, and that we love 
it fanatically, let them come and see.

WINDERMERE.
A few years ago there was only one meaning to the 
word Wikdermere.
It then meant a lake lying 
among mountains, and so secluded that it was some 
distinction even for the travelled man to have seen it.
Now, there is a Windermere railway station, and a 
Windermere post-office and hotel ; — a thriving village 
of Windermere and a populous locality.
This implies 
that a great many people come to the spot ; and the 
spot is so changed by their coming, and by other cir- 
cumstances, that a new guide book is wanted; for 
there is much more to point out than there used to 
be; and what used to be pointed out now requires a 
wholly new description.
Such new guidance and des- 
cription we now propose to give.
The traveller arrives, we must suppose, by the rail- 
way from Kendal, having been dropped at the Oxen- 
holme Junction by the London train from the south, 
or the Edinburgh and Carlisle train from the north.
4 MOUNTAIIS" FORMATION.
The railways skirt the lake district, but do not, and 
cannot, penetrate it : for the obvious reason that rail- 
ways cannot traverse or pierce granite mountains or 
span broad lakes.
If the time should ever come when 
iron roads will intersect the mountainous parts of 
Westmorland and Cumberland, that time is not yet ; 
nor is in view, — loud as have been the lamentations 
of some residents, as if it were to happen to-morrow.
No one who has ascended Dunmail Kaise, or visited 
the head of Coniston Lake, or gone by Kirkstone to 
Patterdale, will for a moment imagine that any con- 
ceivable railway will carry strangers over those passes, 
for generations to come.
It is a great thing that 
steam can convey travellers round the outskirts of the 
district, and up to its openings.
This is now effectually 
done ; and it is all that will be done by the steam 
locomotive during the lifetime of anybody yet born.
The most important of the openings thus reached is 
that of WlKDERMERE.
The mountain region of Cumberland and Westmor- 
land has for its nucleus the cluster of tall mountains, 
of which Scawfell is the highest.
There are the loftiest 
peaks and deepest valleys.
These are surrounded by 
somewhat lower ridges and shallower vales ; and these 
again by others, till the uplands are mere hills and the 
valleys scarcely sunk at all.
It is into these exterior 
undulations that the railways penetrate ; and, at the 
first ridge of any steepness, they must stop.
It is this 
which decides the termination of the Windermere 
railroad, and which prevents the lateral railways from 
coming nearer than the outer base of the hills on the 
OEEEST HEAD.
b 
east and the coast on the west.
When the traveller 
on foot or horseback sees certain reaches of Lake 
Windermere from Orrest Head, lying deep down below 
him, he knows he is coming near the end of the railway, 
which cannot yet plunge and climb as our old mail 
roads must do, if they exist here at all.
As a general 
rule, lakes should be approached from the foot, that 
the ridges may rise, instead of sinking, before the 
observer's eye.
But so happy is the access to Winder- 
mere from the station, that it is hard to say that it 
could have been better ; and that access is, not from 
the south to its lower end, but from the south-east to 
about its middle.
The old coach road over Orrest 
Head and the railway meet at the new village of 
Windermere, whence the road to Bowness descends, 
winding for about a mile and a half, striking the shore 
at a point rather more than half way up the lake, and 
commanding the group of mountains that cluster about 
its head.
Supposing that the traveller desires to see the Win- 
dermere scenery thoroughly, we shall divide our direc- 
tions into portions ; first exhibiting what is to be seen 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the Windermere 
Hotel, or within a moderate walk ; and then describing 
three tours, two of which may be easily taken in a day 
each.
One mountain trip will be added, and, these 
being faithfully prosecuted, the tourist may be assured 
that he has seen all that falls within the scope of a 
summer visitor in the opening region of the Lake 
District.
A few minutes will take him to Orrest Head, where

he will see a lovely view, — a picturesque cottage roof, 
surrounded by trees, in the foreground; grey rocks 
cropping out of the sward on the other side of the 
hedges ; and in front, overlapping hills, range behind 
range, with the grey waters of the lake lying below.
Already, a traveller who should remain any time in 
the district would find himself introduced to the 
humours of a remote region.
Odd sayings and doings 
remain, and traditions of old singularities are not lost.
This place, Orrest Head, was the residence of the noted 
Josiah Brown, who amused himself, a century ago, with 
welcoming beggars, whom he supplied with meat and 
lodging, — sometimes to the number of twenty in a 
night.
He called them his "jolly companions ;" and 
no doubt he got a world of amusement out of them, in 
return for his hopitality.
The local saying, " that's too 
big a bo-o for a young horse," was Josiah Brown's, and 
it was originated thus.
He was breaking in a young- 
horse, when one of his men took a liberty, — such 
as his servants were always taking with him, — but 
in this case to be repented of.
The fellow hid himself 
behind a gate-post, and yelled so tremendously as 
his master passed through that Josiah was thrown, 
and broke his leg.
His good-natured criticism was, 
" that was too big a bo-o for a young horse ;" and this 
is still the proverbial expression of extreme surprise.
The hill to the right is part of the Elleray property, 
so well known as the lake-home of Christopher North, 
and now so much improved by its present proprie- 
tor, Mr. Eastted.

good fortune to obtain a ticket of leave to enter the

grounds,* his first object should be to walk up that hill 
at Elleray, by Mr. Eastted's new drive.
All the way 
up, the views are exquisite : but that from the summit, 
— about 700 feet above the lake, is one of the finest 
the district can show.
The whole length of Winder- 
mere extends below, with its enclosing hills and wooded 
islands ; and towards the head, some of the high- 
est peaks and ridges may be seen : - — Coniston 
Old Man to the west ; Bowfell and the Langdale Pikes 
to the northwest ; Fairfield to the north, with Lough- 
rigg lying, as a mere dark ridge, across the head of 
Windermere ; while, to the north-east, Troutbeck is 
disclosed, with its peaks of High Street and Hill Bell.
All below are woods, with houses peeping out ; on a 
height of the opposite shore, Wray Castle ; further 
north, the little Brathay Chapel, set down near the 
mouth of the valley ; and between Loughrigg and the 
lake, at its head, the white houses of Clappersgate, 
with the chateau-like mansion of Croft Lodge conspi- 
cuous above the rest.
This view is a good deal like

the one from the hill behind the Windermere Hotel, 
which is reached by a lane turning off from Orrest 
Head.
The Elleray one is the most extensive and com- 
plete to the north : but to enjoy the other, leave will be 
readily obtained at the hotel.
The village of Windermere is like nothing that is to 
be seen any where else.
The new buildings (and all 
are new) are of the dark grey stone of the region, and 
are for the most part of a mediaeval style of architec- 
ture.
The Eev. J.
A. Addison, of Windermere, has a 
passion for ecclesiastical architecture ; and his example 
has been a good deal followed.
There is the little 
church of St .
Mary, and there are the schools belonging 
to it, with their steep roofs of curiously-shaped slates : 
and there is St. Mary's Abbey, (new, in spite of its 
antique name), and St. Mary's Cottage.
And there 
will be the new college of St. Mary, standing in a fine 
position, between the main road and the descent to the 
lake.
This college, of which the Eev. J.
A. Addison 
is the warden, is designed to afford a cheap and 
thorough education, on sound church principles, to 
the sons of clergymen chiefly, though not exclusively.
It is under high patronage, ecclesiastical and local.
The pupils, in a college garb of the olden time, are a 
curious feature in the aspect of the place ; and they 
will be more so when they get their new buildings to 
live in.
Judging by the plan and elevation put forth, 
the edifice will be in excellent taste, and a great adorn- 
ment to the neighbourhood.
The large house, on the 
hill and amidst the woods of the Elleray estate, and 
often mistaken for the new college, is the property of 
ROAD TO BOWNES8.
9 
John Gandy, Esq., who has chosen a charming site 
for his abode ; and a little further, on the same side of 
the road, is the pretty villa-residence of Miss Yates.
There are villas on either side the road, on almost 
every favourable spot, all the way to Bowness.
The 
road past the college grounds leaves the other 
one to be called by the inevitable title of "the old 
road." We pass rows of lodging-houses ; and then we 
see to the right the spot where the college is to be : 
and to the left Ellerthwaite, the residence of Mr. Geo.
H. Gardner; and then, to the right, the cottage of 
Mylnbeck, the residence of the Misses Watson, daugh- 
ters of the late bishop of Llandaif : a common house 
in its aspect towards the road, but, as seen over the 
wall, very pretty in its garden-front.
The next gate 
on the left is the entrance to the Craig, built by Sir 
Thomas Pasley, and now inhabited by W.
E. Greg, 
Esq. Below this, the houses begin to thicken about 
the entrance to Bowness.
Among them, a road to the 
left leads to one of the most charming points of view in 
the neighbourhood, — a hill named Biscut How, crested 
with rocks, which afford as fine a station as the sum- 
mit of Elleray for a view of the entire lake and its 
shores.
BOWNESS 
Is the port of Windermere.
There the new steamboats 
put up; and thence go forth the greater number of 
fishing and pleasure boats which adorn the lake.
There 
is a good deal of bustle in the place ; and the lower 
parts, near the water, are very hot in summer : and the 
more since the building of a new lodging house in a 
10 BOWNESS.
space near the church, which used to be called the lungs 
of Bowness.
The two great inns, however, are in airy 
situations, — the garden platform of Ullock's Royal 
Hotel overlooking the gardens that slope down to the 
shot e ; and the Crown being on a hill which commands 
the whole place.
These inns are both extremely well 
managed; and it is for the traveller to say whether 
their charges, which are uniform, justify a complaint 
which has been made, (we think unreasonably as 
regards the Lake District in general) of high prices.
During the season, which extends from May to Novem- 
ber, the charges are two shillings for breakfast, (including 
meat, fish, &c.,) two shillings and sixpence for dinner ; 
and one shilling and sixpence for tea.
A private sitting- 
room is charged two shillings and sixpence per day.
Ullock's Hotel, called Royal since the visit of Queen 
Adelaide in 1840, makes up between seventy and eighty 
beds.
Close at hand is a little museum, where the birds 
of the district may be seen, exceedingly well stuffed 
and arranged by Mr. Armstrong, a waiter at the hotel.
The Crown has ten private sitting rooms, and makes up 
ninety beds.
Nothing can well exceed the beauty of 
the view from its garden seats.
There is an exhibition open in Bowness during the 
summer months, which, it will be useful, and particu- 
larly agreeable to the stranger to visit, before he pene- 
trates further into the district.
Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey 
Aspland exhibit their paintings of lake scenery every 
summer ; and their pictures are of a high order of merit 
as works of art, as well as for their fidelity as portraits 
of scenery.
Mr. Aspland's outline sketches are excel-

lent ; and those on which the passes are clearly indicated 
are of especial value to the pedestrian tourist.
The old churchyard of Bowness, with its dark yews, 
and the weather-worn church, long and low, is the 
most venerable object in the place.
The chancel win- 
dow of the church contains painted glass from Furness 
Abbey.
The tomb of Bishop Watson will be found in 
the churchyard, near the east window.
The rectory, 
which is hardly less venerable than the church, stands 
at a considerable distance from the village, and is 
approached through fields and a garden.
The old- 
fashioned porch is there, of which this is said to be 
the last remaining instance in the whole district, — the 
roomy, substantial porch, with benches on each side, 
long enough to hold a little company of parishioners, 
and a round ivy-clad chimney immediately surmount- 
ing the porch.
Within, there is abundant space, with 
little elevation ; — plenty of room in the hall and 
parlours, with ceilings that one can touch with the 
hand.
Almost every other noticeable edifice in Bow- 
ness is new, or at least modern ; the schools, the gift 
of the late Mr. Bolton, of Storrs Hall, — the Italian 
villa, called Belsfield, the property of the Baroness de 
Sternberg, and many others.
The visitor will first repair to the strand, to salute 
the waters.
He will find a good quay, with boats in 
abundance, and several boat-houses within view.
A 
substantial little pier is built out into the lake ; and 
on either side is a steamboat moored during winter ; 
and to the end these two steamers come, six times a 
day each, during the summer.
To the right, gardens 
12 EEREY MB.
slope down to this little bay ; and they look gay even 
in winter from their profusion of evergreens, and from 
the ivy which clothes their walls.
The church just 
peeps out behind the houses above.
Looking over the 
lake, Curwen's Island is just opposite.
In May and 
early June, the woods of that island, and of all the 
promontories round, present a most diversified foliage, 
— from the golden tufts of the oak to the sombre hue 
of the pines, with every gradation of green between.
In 
July and August, the woods are what some call too 
green, — massy and impenetrable, — casting deep sha- 
dows on the sward and the waters.
Within the shadow 
on the shore stands the angler, watching the dimpling 
of the surface, as the fly touches it, or the fish leaps 
from it : and within the shadow on the water, the boat 
swings idly with the current ; and the student, come 
hither for recreation, reads or sleeps as he reclines, 
waiting for the cool of the afternoon.
Turning to the 
north, the highest peaks are not seen from this strand ; 
but Fairfield and Loughrigg close in the head of the 
lake.
Turning southwards along the margin, and walking 
about a mile, the explorer reaches the point of the 
promontory, Ferry Nab, which stretches out opposite 
the Ferry House, — itself on the point of an opposite 
promontory.
There can hardly be a more charming 
resting-place than a seat under the last trees of this 
projection.
It is breezy here ; and the waters smack 
the shore cheerily.
The Troutbeck hills come into 
view, and the head of the lake is grander.
The round 
house on Curwen's island is seen among the trees.
The

Ferry house, under its canopy of tall sycamores, and with 
its pebbly beach, is immediately opposite ; and behind 
it rises the wooded bank which is, in light or shadow, 
one of the chief graces of the scene.
If the sun shines 
upon it, it is feathered with foliage to the very ridge, 
and the bay beneath it is blue and lustrous.
If the 
sun has gone down behind it, the bay is black ; and 
every dipping bird sprinkles it with silver ; and the 
wild duck that comes sailing out with her brood, draws 
behind her a pencil of white light.
From this point, 
a view opens to the south.
In the expanse of waters 
lies another island ; and farther down, on the eastern 
shore, a pier extends with a little tower at the end.
This is Storrs : and at that pier did the guests embark 
when Scott went to meet Canning at Mr. Bolton's, and 
the fine regatta took place, (under the direction of 
Christopher North) which is celebrated in Lockhart's 
Life of Scott.
This was only two years before Canning's 
death, and seven before that of Scott.
Mr. and Mrs.
Bolton are gone ; and Christopher North himself has 
followed.
It is probable that no stranger ever sees that 
pier at Storrs without thinking of Professor Wilson ; 
and, indeed, there is no spot in the neighbourhood with 
which his memory, and the gratitude of his readers, is 
not associated.
Any where, such a presence is rarely 
seen ; and it was especially impressive in the places he 
test loved to haunt.
More than one person has said 
that Wilson reminded them of the first man, Adam ; 
so full was his large frame of vitality, force and sen- 
tience.
His tread seemed to shake the ground, and his 
glance to pierce through stone walls ; and, as for his 
14 A SHORT WALK.
voice, there was no heart that could stand before it.
In his hour of emotion, he swept away all hearts, 
whithersoever he would.
No less striking was it to see 
him in a mood of repose, as he was seen when steering 
the packet-boat that used to pass between Bowness and 
Ambleside, before the steamers were put upon the lake.
Sitting motionless, with his hand upon the rudder, in 
the presence of journeymen and market-women, and his 
eye apparently looking beyond everything into nothing, 
and his mouth closed above his beard, as if he meant 
never to speak again, he was quite as impressive and 
immortal an image as he could have been to the students 
of his moral philosophy class, or the comrades of his 
jovial hours.
He was known, and with reverence and 
affection, beside the trout-stream and the mountain tarn, 
and, amidst the damp gloom of Elleray, where he could 
not bring himself to let a tree or a sprig be lopped 
that his wife had loved.
Every old boatman and 
young angler, every hoary shepherd and primitive dame 
among the hills of the district, knew him and enjoyed 
his presence.
He made others happy by being so in- 
tensely happy himself, when his brighter moods were 
on him ; and when he was mournful, no one desired to 
be gay.
He is gone with his joy and his grief; and 
the region is so much the darker in a thousand eyes.
Instead of returning to his inn the way he came, the 
stranger may make a moderate and pleasant walk by 
going through Bowness on the Ambleside road, and 
round by Cook's House.
The first noticeable abode 
that he will see is Eayrigg, — a rather low, rambling, 
grey house, standing on the grass near a little bay of 
MILLER BROW.
15 
the lake.
It is a charming old-fashioned house, and its 
position has every advantage, except that it stands too 
low.
On the high wall by the road side, immediately 
before reaching the gate of Rayrigg, the stranger will 
be struck with the variety of ferns.
That wall is an 
excellent introduction to the stone fences of the region, 
richly adorned as many of them are with mosses and 
ferns.
Passing between woods, resounding with brawling 
streams, the road leads up a rather steep ascent, the 
summit of which is called Miller Brow.
Hence is seen 
what, in our opinion, is a view unsurpassed for beauty 
in the whole Lake District.
The entire lake lies below, 
the white houses of Clappersgate being distinctly visi- 
ble at the north end and the Beacon at the south : and 
the diversity of the framework of this sheet of water is 
here most striking.
The Calgarth woods, for which we 
are indebted to Bishop Watson, rising and falling, 
spreading and contracting below, with green undulating 
meadows interposed, are a perfect treat to the eye ; and 
so are the islands clustering in the centre of the lake.
Wray Castle stands forth well above the promontory 
opposite ; and at the head, the Langdale Pikes, and 
their surrounding mountains seem, in some states of 
the atmosphere, to approach and overshadow the 
waters ; and in others to retire, and shroud themselves 
in soft haze and delicate hues peculiar to cloud land.
There is a new house, built just below the ridge at 
Miller Brow by William Sheldon, which we have 
thought, from the time the foundation was laid, the 
most enviable abode in the country, — commanding a 
16 A STEAMBOAT TEIP.
view worthy of a mountain top, while sheltered by hill 
and wood, and with the main road so close at hand that 
the conveniences of life are as procurable as in a street.
A short descent hence brings the walker to Cook's 
House, — the point where four roads meet.
Cook's 
house has only just disappeared.
With it has disap- 
peared a fine specimen of the old fireplace of the district, 
with its chimney-corners.
It is rather a drawback to 
the romance hanging about those wide old chimnies, to 
know that the good man had to sit with some special 
covering over his head and shoulders, to protect him 
from the soot that the rain brought down.
At Cook's 
house there were recesses and cupboards in that strange 
roofless alcove, — the door being of the old oak of which 
such fine specimens may be seen in the farm-houses of 
the dales.
We should rather say, might till lately have 
been seen ; for we fear there are but few left.
The 
greater number of old chests, cupboard doors, and high 
backed chairs, covered with carvings, have found their 
way to the London curiosity shops, whence agents have 
been sent through the wildest places in the district to 
buy up such relics at high prices.
Still, there are 
specimens left, as the observant traveller will notice.
Of the four roads which meet here, the one 
to his left would take him to Ambleside ; the one 
opposite, to Troutbeck.
To reach his inn he must take 
the one to the right, which leads him straight home.
The next thing to be done is to take a survey of the 
whole lake by a steamboat trip.
During the summer, 
two steamers make six trips each ; so that the stranger 
can choose his own hour, and go down or up first, as he

pleases.
In accordance with the rule of lake approach, 
we should recommend his going down first.
He em- 
barks at the pier at Bowness, and is carried straight 
across to the Ferry, where the boats touch.
Then the 
course is southwards, with the lake narrowing, and the 
hills sinking till the scenery becomes merely pretty.
The water is very shallow towards the foot, and the 
practicable channel is marked out by posts.
The best 
work that the whole neighbourhood could undertake 
would be the deepening of the lake at this part, and of 
the river which carries off the overflow.
Not only is 
the passage of the steamers difficult : there is a far worse 
evil in the inundations which take place on all the low- 
lying lands, even up to Rydal, from the insufficiency of 
the outlet.
The mischief has much increased since 
drainage has been introduced.
The excellent and 
indispensable practice of land drainage must be followed 
up by an improvement in arterial drainage, or floods 
are inevitable.
The water which formerly dribbled 
away in the course of many days, or even weeks, now 
gushes out from the drains all at once ; and if the main 
outlets are not enlarged in proportion, the waters are 
thrown back upon the land.
This is the case now in 
the neighbourhood of Windermere, — the meadows and 
low-lying houses at Ambleside, a mile or two from the 
lake, being flooded every winter by the overflow of the 
lake first, then of the river, then of the tributary streams.
The Steam Yacht Companies gave fifty pounds to have 
the lake deepened at Fell Foot, about five years ago ; and 
Mr. White, the proprietor of the Newby Bridge Hotel, 
subscribed the same amount : and this was good as far 
18 LAKE SHORES.
as it went.
But a much larger operation is required.
There is a weir below Newby Bridge, to serve a corn 
mill.
Now, the days of weirs and watermills are com- 
ing to an end.
In these days of steam engines it is 
not to be endured that hundreds of acres should be 
turned into swamps, and hundreds of lives lost by fever, 
ague, and rheumatism, for the sake of a waterpower, 
which pays perhaps thirty pounds or forty pounds 
a-year.
We say this of watermills generally; and in 
regard to the need of sufficient arterial drainage, we 
speak of the shores of Windermere in particular.
The 
expense of carrying off the utmost surplus of the waters 
in the wettest season would be presently repaid, here as 
anywhere else, by the improved value of the land and 
house property, relieved from the nuisance of flood.
The Swan Inn at Newby Bridge is exceedingly 
comfortable ; and the charges are very moderate.
The 
stranger will have to come again, on his way to Furness, 
at all events, and perhaps in some trip to Hawkshead ; 
or when making the circuit of the lake by land.
Now, 
he merely calls for lunch or tea, during the stopping of 
the steamer; and then he is off again, up the lake.
After the Ferry and Bowness, the next call is at Low- 
wood inn, where there are sure to be passengers landing 
or embarking.
Between Bowness and Lowwood inn, 
Eayrigg has been seen, beside the little bay ; and then 
Ecclerigg, with its overshadowing trees, and pretty 
pier.
It is inhabited by Richard Luther Watson, Esq., 
grandson of the late Bishop of Llandaff.
Just above 
Lowwood, high up on the wooded side of Wansfell, 
will be seen Dove Nest, once the abode of Mrs.

Hemans, when its appearance was more primitive and 
less pretty than it is now, — improved as it has been 
by its present resident, her then young friend, the Rev.
Robert Perceval Graves.
Next comes Wansfell Holme, 
inhabited by the Rev. James J.
Hornby.
This is 
another choice situation.
On the opposite shore is Wray 
Castle, erected by James Dawson, Esq., — a most defensi- 
ble-looking place for so peaceful a region; but an enviable 
residence, both from its interior beauty and the views it 
commands.
Just above it, Pullwyke bay, where lily of 
the valley is found, runs far into the land ; and overlook- 
ing it is seen Pull Cottage, the residence of Major 
Rogers.
Next, the sweet, tranquil Brathay valley opens, 
with Mr. Redmay ne's mansion of Brathay Hall, on a 
green slope above the lake ; and just behind, on a wooded 
knoll in the gorge of the valley, the beautiful little 
church, called Brathay Chapel, built by Mr. Redmayne.
Two rivers fall into the lake, uniting just before they 
reach it ; — the Rothay, which comes down from Dun- 
mail Raise, beyond G-rasmere, and the Brathay, which 
issues from Elterwater, a group of pools, rather than 
a lake, lying at the foot of the hills near Langdale.
The valleys of the Rothay and the Brathay are 
separated by Loughrigg, — the ridge of which, at its 
further end, commands Grasmere ; its Windermere end 
shelters Clappersgate and Water-head.
The steamer 
sweeps round to the pier at Waterhead, where there is 
a cluster of dwellings, the most imposing of which is 
the large grey stone house called Wanlas How, the 
property of Alexander C.
Brenchley, Esq. Omnibuses 
are in waiting here, from Ambleside and Grasmere, —

the one, distant one mile ; and the other, between four 
and five.
Our tourist will, however, complete the 
circuit of the lake, by returning to Bowness.
There are plenty of boats to be had at Waterhead 
and Bowness, and watermen who are practised and 
skilful.
The stranger should be warned, however, 
against two dangers which it is rash to encounter.
Nothing should induce him to sail on Windermere, or 
on any lake surrounded by mountains.
There is no 
calculating on, or accounting for, the gusts that come 
down between the hills ; and no skill and practice 
obtained by boating on rivers or the waters of a flat 
country are any sure protection here.
And nothing 
should induce him to go out in one of the little skiffs 
which are too easily attainable and too tempting, 
from the ease of rowing them.
The surface may be- 
come rough at any minute, and those skiffs are unsafe 
in all states of the water but the calmest.
The long 
list of deaths occasioned in this way, — deaths both of 
residents and strangers, — should have put an end to 
the use of these light skiffs, long ago.
The larger 
boats are safe enough, and most skilfully managed by 
their rowers : and the stranger can enjoy no better treat 
than gliding along, for hours of the summer day, peep- 
ing into the coves and bays, coasting the islands, and 
lying cool in the shadows of the woods.
The clearness 
of the water is a common surprise to the resident in a 
level country ; and it is pleasant sport to watch the 
movements of the fish, darting, basking, or leaping in 
the sunshine, or quivering their fins in the reflected ray.
What the quality of the trout and char is, the tourist 
will probably find every day, at breakfast and dinner.

For the greater convenience of taking his pleasure on 
the water, the traveller will now shift his quarters to 
Bowness, where he will find himself, as we have said, 
comfortably accommodated at either Ullock's Royal 
Hotel or the Crown.
Now is his time for visiting 
Furness Abbey.
This should be the first of his tours, 
because it will lead him into the least mountainous parts 
of the district.
He will go down to Newby Bridge either by steamer, 
or by the road, which passes the grounds of Storrs, and 
cuts over hill and dale, and winds among the copses, 
till it crosses the bridge opposite the inn.
Those 
copses have been valuable to the remotest known date, 
for charcoal, and they have become more so since the 
increase of manufactures has stimulated the demand for 
bobbins.
There are bobbin-mills at Skelwith, at Amble-

side, at Troutbeck Bridge, and at Staveley.
But the 
charcoal-burning goes on still, we believe, with some 
activity in these southern parts of the district.
The 
one the traveller has just passed was the scene of the 
life of two brothers whose name and fame will not be 
let die.
Their name was Dodgson ; and they lived in 
Cartmel Fell above a century ago.
They were so intent 
on their wood-cutting that they spent Sunday in cook- 
ing their food for the whole week.
They ate little but 
oatmeal porridge ; and, when that fell short, they tried 
Friar Tuck's ostensible diet of dried peas and hard 
beans.
As they grew old, they began to feel the need 
of domestic help.
Said the one to the other, " Thou 
mun out and tait a wife." — "Yes!" was the reply; 
"if thear be a hard job, thou olus sets yan tult." 
The thing was accomplished, however ; and when the 
old fellows were still chopping away at upwards of 
eighty, rain or shine, ill or well, there was the wife in 
the dwelling, and children to help.
The brothers left 
considerable property ; but it went the way of miser's 
money ; and there are no Dodgson' s now in Cartmel 
Fell.
All the way to Furness, there are specimens of roads 
and lanes which are locally called Ore gates (ways,) 
from their being constructed from the slag and refuse 
of the iron-ore formerly brought into the peninsula to 
be smelted, on account of the abundance of charcoal 
there.
There are few objects more picturesque, to this 
day, than the huts of the woodcutters, who remain on a 
particular spot till their work is done.
Upon piled 
stems of trees heather is heaped, to make a shaggy

thatch ; and when the smoke is oozing out, thin and 
blue, from the hole in the centre, or the children are 
about the fire in front, where the great pot is boiling, 
the sketcher cannot but stop and dash down the scene 
in his book.
The children will say he is "spying 
fancies," — as they say of every one who sketches, 
botanizes, or in any way explores ; and perhaps some- 
body may have the good taste to advise him to come 
at night, when the glow from the fires makes the thicket 
a scene of singular wildness and charm.
A sad story 
about a charcoal-burner belongs to this neighbourhood.
On two farms lived families which were about to be 
connected by marriage.
The young lover was a 
"coaler," — a charcoal-burner; and one stormy day, 
when he was watching his fire, and sitting on a stone 
near his hut to take his dinner, he was struck dead by 
lightning.
The poor crazed survivor, his Kitty Dawson, 
went to that hut after the funeral, and would never 
leave it again.
She did nothing but sit on that stone, 
or call his name through the wood.
She was well cared 
for.
There was always food in the hut, and some kind 
eye daily on the watch, — though with care not to 
intrude.
One day in winter, some sportsmen who were 
passing took the opportunity of leaving some provision 
in the hut.
They became silent, and silenced their 
dogs.
But she could never more be disturbed.
They 
found her dead.
It is eight miles hence to the cheerful little 
town of Ulverstone, which is now reached by the 
railway from Whitehaven; and from Ulverstone, the 
railway stretches south, past Furness Abbey, to the 
b 3 
24 TUEKESS ABBEY.
margin of the sea.
From Ulverstone to Furness, it 
is only seven miles.
There is a good inn, — (though 
not cheap, as cheapness is not to be expected in the 
precincts of secluded ruins :) and here the tourist 
should bespeak his bed, if he means to study the 
Abbey.
The Abbey was founded in A.
D. 1127.
Its domains 
extended over the whole promontory in which it lies, 
and to the north, as far as the Shire Stones on Wry- 
nose.
They occupied the space between "Windermere 
on the east and the Duddon on the west.
The Abbot 
was a sort of king ; and his abbey was enriched, not 
only by King Stephen, bat by the gifts of neighbour- 
ing proprietors, who were glad to avail themselves, not 
only of its religious privileges, but of its military 
powers for the defence of their estates against border 
foes, and the outlaws of the mountains, — the descend- 
ants of the conquered Saxons, who inherited their 
fathers 5 vengeance.
The Abbey was first peopled from 
Normandy, — a sufficient number of Benedictine monks 
coming over from the monastery of Savigny to establish 
this house in honour of St. Marye of Furnesse.
In a 
few years their profession changed : they followed St.
Bernard, and wore the white cassock, caul and scapu- 
lary, instead of the dress of the grey monks.
It is 
strange now to see the railway traversing those woods 
where these grey-robed foreigners used to pass hither 
and thither, on their holy errands to the depressed and 
angry native Saxons dwelling round about.
The situa- 
tion of the Abbey, as is usual with religious houses, is 
fine.
It stands in the depth of a glen, with a stream 
EUENESS ABBEY.
25 
flowing by, — the sides of the glen being clothed with 
wood.
A beacon once belonged to it ; a watch tower 
on an eminence accessible from the abbey, whose signal- 
fire was visible all over Low Furness, when assistance 
was required, or foes were expected.
The building is 
of the pale red stone of the district.
It must formerly 
have almost filled the glen : and the ruins give an 
impression, to this day, of the establishment having 
been worthy of the zeal of its founder, King Stephen, 
and the extent of its endowments, which were princely.
The boundary-wall of the precincts inclosed a space of 
sixty-five acres, over which are scattered remains that 
have, within our own time, been interpreted to be those 
of the mill, the granary, the fish-ponds, the ovens and 
kilns, and other offices.
As for the architecture, the 
heavy shaft is found alternating with the clustered 
pillar, and the round Norman with the pointed Gothic 
arch.
The masonry is so good that the remains are, 
even now, firm and massive ; and the winding stair- 
cases within the walls are still in good condition in 
many places.
The nobleness of the edifice consisted in 
its extent and proportions ; for the stone would not 
bear the execution of any very elaborate ornament.
The crowned heads of Stephen and his Queen Maude 
are seen outside the window of the Abbey, and are 
among the most interesting of the remains.
It is all 
triste and silent now.
The chapter-house, where so 
many grave councils were held, is open to the babbling 
winds.
Where the abbot and his train swept past in 
religious procession, over inscribed pavements, echoing 
to the tread, the stranger now wades among tall ferns 
26 CONISTON.
and knotted grasses, stumbling over stones fallen from 
the place of honour.
No swelling anthems are heard 
there now, or penitential psalms ; but only the voice of 
birds, winds, and waters.
But this blank is what the 
stranger comes for.
Knowing what a territory the 
Abbots of Furness ruled over, like a kingdom, it is 
well to come hither to look how it is with that old 
palace and mitre, and to take one more warning of how 
Time shatters thrones, and dominations and powers, 
and causes the glories of the world to pass away.
The stranger will be among the ruins late, by moon 
or by star light ; and again in the morning, before the 
dew is off, and when the hidden violet perfumes the 
area where the censer once was swung, and where the 
pillars cast long shadows on the sward.
But he must 
not linger ; for he has a good circuit to make before 
night.
The lake of Coniston, which is his next object, is in 
the district between Windermere and the Duddon, 
which has already been mentioned as formerly belonging 
to Furness Abbey.
From Ulverstone, his road com- 
mands the estuary of the Leven for a few miles, and 
then approaches the foot of Coniston Water, which it 
reaches at eight miles from Ulverstone.
Seven miles 
more bring him to the New Inn at Coniston, which, 
built under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. J.
Gr. Marshall, 
is one of the most comfortable hotels in England.
This 
lake, like Windermere, is flanked by low hills at the 
south end, and inclosed by magnificent mountains at 
the head, where Mr. J.
G-.
Marshall's house and lands 
are more gloriously situated than almost any other in 
C01STST01S" BANK.

the region.
The little town of Church Coniston, and 
the New Inn, are a mile short of Waterhead ; and the 
stranger must stop, and look through the place, while 
his early dinner is preparing.
The Old Man, eleventh 
in height of the mountains of the district, (2,576 feet) 
towers above him ; and the abodes of the people will 
shew him that he is in the neighbourhood of a copper 
mine.
There is one, some way up the mountain ; and 
he may see the winding road up to it.
Higher up, 
where there is an evident hollow, he is told that he 
would find a deep black tarn ; and higher up, another.
But to climb the mountain is a day's work, with much 
doubt of success, (that is, of a clear summit,) and he 
must to-day be satisfied with what is below.
Yewdale, 
with its grey rocks, cushioned with heather up to their 
summits, stretches away northwards from the head of 
the lake, into a gorge where the mountains overlap.
One of the crags there is called Eaven Crag : and it is 
said that a pair of ravens is living now, there or some- 
where near.
It is to be hoped that, now the eagles are 
gone, the last ravens will not be destroyed or scared 
away by the shot of the miners, or other rash sports- 
men, who are too apt to bring down every bird they 
see.
There are many picturesque dwellings in the area 
which is between the heights and the lake: but the 
best view of these is from the point to which the 
stranger will proceed, after his lunch or early dinner.
He must order his car to meet him in an hour at the 
junction of the two lake roads, on the Hawkshead 
road ; and then he must walk a mile to the Waterhead, 
and then on, round the head of the lake, in the direction 
28 te:n t t lodge.
of Tent Lodge, which is seen nestling in its garden at 
some elevation above the lake.
The road passes the 
site of the former Waterhead inn, now a young planta- 
tion of Mr. Marshall's.
Then, commanding the whole 
expanse of the lake, it begins to ascend, as it curves 
round to the east ; and, at about a mile and three- 
quarters from the new inn, there stands the' house in 
which Elizabeth Smith lived and died; and, on the 
opposite side of the road, Tent Lodge, built on the spot 
where a tent was pitched, that she might draw her 
dying breath with greater ease, and enjoy, as long as 
possible, the incomparable landscape there stretched 
before her.
The boat-house is at the bottom of the 
slope, down which she used to take her mother's guests; 
and she and her sister were so well practiced at the oar 
that they could show the beauties of the scene from 
any point of the lake.
The first station is, however, 
from a field, — the first beyond the new house on 
Coniston Bank.
Some people think this the finest view 
in the whole district : and truly, the frequent visitor 
pronounces it incomparable, every time he comes ; and 
the passing tourist feels that, once seen, it can never be 
forgotten.
Nowhere else, perhaps, is the grouping of 
the mountain peaks, and the indication of their recesses 
so striking ; and as to the foreground, with its glittering 
waterfall, its green undulations, its diversified woods, 
its bright dwellings, and its clear lake, — it conveys the 
strongest impression of joyful charm, — of fertility, 
prosperity and comfort, nestling in the bosom of the 
rarest beauty.

29 
turn which would lead him down again to Tent Lodge, 
the stranger has rather a steep ascent before him, from 
point to point of which he finds, on looking behind 
him, new views of the lake appearing, while the magni- 
tude of the Old Man becomes more apparent as he 
recedes from it.
By the roadpost, which indicates the 
two ways to the two sides of the lake, he finds his car ; 
and then he proceeds through a wild country — moor- 
land, sprinkled with grey rock, — in the direction of 
Hawkshead, which is three miles from Waterhead.
The parish church of Hawkshead is ancient; its 
appearance is venerable ; and it stands, as a church 
should do, in full view of the country round, — of the 
valley in which Esthwaite Water lies.
Elizabeth Smith 
lies buried there ; and there is a tablet to her memory 
in the churchyard.
At the ancient Grammar School of 
Hawkshead, Wordsworth and his brother were educated.
Passing through the neat little town, the road turns to 
the left, to reach the northern end of Esthwaite Water, 
which is two miles long, and half a mile broad ; — a 
quiet sheet of water, with two promontories stretching 
into it, which appear like islands, nearly dividing it into 
a chain of ponds.
A round pond at the northern end 
of the lake, connected with it by a narrow creek, exhibits 
a strange phencemenon.
It has a floating island, — not 
like that of Derwentwater, which is a mass of mud and 
vegetable tangle, — but actually bearing trees : and this 
island is carried by strong winds from the one side to 
the other.
The name of the pond is Priest's Pot : a 
fact which some explain by a tradition that a priest 
was drowned there ; and others by a supposition of its 
30 THE EERRY.
holding about as much as a thirsty priest would like to 
drink, if the liquor were sufficiently good.
Lakebank 
is a pretty place; and further on, Lakefield, (J.
E. 
Ogden's, Esq.,) at Near Sawrey, commands perhaps the 
best view in the valley.
Just beyond, the road turns 
to the left, through an undulating country of consi- 
derable beauty.
We find a trace of the rebellion of 
1745 in the name of a lane, called " Scotch Grate" (way.) 
It was here that the fearful Highlanders were looked 
for, on their march to Derby ; and here they might 
have had all their own way if they had come : for 
Sawrey had no idea of showing fight.
All the inhabi- 
tants, carrying all their valuables, hied away, and took 
refuge together in a solitary building which was called 
Cook's braw bog-house.
And braw it must have 
been, to hold all the Sawrey ans.
The view of 
Windermere from the highest point is very fine.
The road leads through Farther Sawrey to the Ferry 
House.
If there is daylight left, (and there may be, 
as the Ferry is only seven miles from Coniston Water- 
head) the traveller may as well go to the Station House, 
which he must have seen from the opposite side of the 
lake, peeping out of the ever-green woods.
There he 
obtains fine views, up and down the lake, and may 
mark, on the way up, the largest laurels he has ever 
seen.
His driver, or some resident, will probably take 
care that he does not stay till it is more than reasonably 
dusk.
As reasons in plenty are always found for not 
marrying on a Friday, so it is said to be impossible, 
somehow or other, to get over to the Ferry Nab in the 
ferry-boat, except by daylight.
And if you should 
THE CEIER OF CLAIFE.
31 
arrive at the Nab too late, you may call all night for 
the boat, and it will not come.
The traveller may 
judge for himself how much of the local tale may be true.
He may probably have heard of the Crier of Claife, 
whose fame has spread far beyond the district : but if 
not, he should hear of the Crier now, while within sight 
of Ferry Nab. If he asks who or what the Crier was, 
— that is precisely what nobody can tell, though every 
body would be glad to know : but we know all how 
and about it, except just what it really was.
It gave 
its name to the place now called the Crier of Claife, — 
the old quarry in the wood, which no man will go near 
at midnight : — 
It was about the time of the Eeformation, one 
stormy night, when a party of travellers were making 
merry at the Ferry-house, — then a humble tavern, — 
that a call for the boat was heard from the Nab. A 
quiet, sober boatman obeyed the call, though the night 
was wild and fearful.
When he ought to be returning, 
the tavern guests stepped out upon the shore, to see 
whom he would bring.
He returned alone, ghastly and 
dumb with horror.
Next morning, he was in a high 
fever ; and in a few days he died, without having been 
prevailed upon to say what he had seen at the Nab.
For weeks after, there were shouts, yells, and howlings 
at the Nab, on every stormy night : and no boatman 
would attend to any call after dark.
The Eeformation 
had not penetrated the region ; and the monk from 
Furness who dwelt on one of the islands of the lake, 
was applied to to exorcise the Nab. On Christmas day, 
he assembled all the inhabitants on Chapel Island, and 
32 CIIAR.
performed in their presence services which should for 
ever confine the ghost to the quarry in the wood behind 
the Ferry, now called the Crier of Claife.
Some say 
that the priest conducted the people to the quarry and 
laid the ghost, — then and there.
— Laid though it 
be, nobody goes there at night.
It is still told how the 
foxhounds in eager chase would come to a full stop at 
that place ; and how, within the existing generation, a 
schoolmaster from Colthouse, who left home to pass the 
Crier, was never seen more.
Whatever may be said 
about the repute of ghosts in our day, it is certain that 
this particular story is not dead.
Meantime, the heavy, roomy ferry-boat is ready : the 
horse is taken out of the car ; and both are shipped.
Two or three, or half-a-dozen people take advantage of 
the passage : the rowers, with their ponderous oars, are 
on the bench ; and the great machine is presently afloat.
The Ferry House looks more tempting than ever when 
seen from under its own sycamores, — jutting out as it 
does between quiet bays on either hand.
The landing 
takes place on the opposite promontory : the horse is 
put to, and the traveller is presently at his inn.
He 
is ready for his meal (be it tea or supper) of lake trout 
or char.
The best char are in Coniston Water : but 
they are good every where ; especially to hungry travel- 
lers, sitting at table within sight of the waters whence 
they have just been fished.
The potted char of Coniston 
is sent, as every epicure knows, to all parts of the world 
where men know what is good.
As for the trout, there 
can be none finer than that of Windermere.

As the traveller will have other opportunities of 
observing the six miles of rnailroad between Bowness 
and Ambleside, he may as well go round, and see 
Ullswater, on the day of his removal.
Sending his 
luggage on by the omnibus to one of the three chief 
Ambleside inns, he will take a car for the day, and go 
by Troutbeck to Patterdale.
The country people will tell him, as he turns up to 
Troutbeck at Cook's House, that he is going to see 
"the handsomest view in these parts, — especially at 
the back-end of the year." And wonderfully fine the 
views are, as the road ascends, commanding the entire 
lake, and the whole range of mountains from Coniston 
Old Man to Fairfield.
The singular valley of Trout- 
beck was once a wooded basin, where the terrified 
Britons took refuge from the Eomans, while the latter 
were making their great road from Kendal to Penrith.
That road actually ran along the very ridge of the 
34 TROUTBECK.
Troutbeck hills, as any one may see who will climb the 
mountain called, for this reason, High Street.
What 
a sight it must have been — the pioneers felling the 
trees, and paving the way, and the soldiers following, 
with their armour and weapons gleaming in the sun, 
while the trembling natives cowered in the forest below, 
— listening now to the blows of the workmen, and now 
to the warlike music of the troops, marching up from 
Kendal!
After Eomans and Saxons were gone, the 
valley was a great park, and the inhabitants were 
virtually serfs, in danger of the gallows, (which had a 
hill to itself, named after it to this day) at the will 
and pleasure of the one great man.
In course of time, 
— that is, a good many centuries ago, — the valley was 
disparked, and divided among the inhabitants, — only 
one very large estate being left, — the new park, con- 
taining 2,000 acres.
This was the estate given by 
Charles I, to Huddlestone Phillipson, for his services in 
the civil wars.
The valley now contains a string of 
hamlets, — Town End, Town Head, High Green, Crag, 
and High Fold ; and its farmsteads and outbuildings 
show some of the most curious specimens of ancient 
edifices that are to be seen in the district.
Josiah 
Brown, whom we mentioned in connexion with Orrest 
Head, found nearly his match in oddity in this vale.
A "rum fellow" in Troutbeck had a prodigious bull ; 
and so had Josiah : and what must they do but meet 
half-way, and have a bull-fight ; the terms being that the 
winner should have the fallen animal.
Josiah actually 
came riding his bull.
The battle was tremendous ; and 
the Troutbeck animal went down before Josiah' s, and 
TROUTBECK CHAPEL.
35 
was given by him to the poor of Troutbeck.
These 
anecdotes appear very strange to people who have lived 
in towns, or among the more level manners of the south : 
and this is why we relate them.
Thej are among the 
curiosities of the district.
Troutbeck is the most 
primitive of the frequented valleys of the district.
To 
find any other so antique and characteristic, it is neces- 
sary to leave the high road, and explore the secluded 
dales of which the summer tourist sees and hears 
nothing.
The dale looks from the uplands as if it had 
been scooped out between the ridges with a gigantic 
scoop.
Its levels are parcelled out into small fields, of 
all manner of shapes ; and the stream, — the beck 
abounding in trout, — winds along the bottom, from the 
foot of High Street, to fall into the lake just by Calgarth.
The road now followed by the tourist descends into 
the vale sharply, by the abode of John Wilson, Esq., at 
The How, and crosses the bridge, in full view of the 
chapel, which was consecrated in 1562, and thoroughly 
repaired in 1828.
It is one of the small churches that, 
with their square tower and bell, look and sound so well 
in the dales.
This one seats 160 worshipers.
Imme- 
diately beyond the bridge, the road mounts again very 
steeply, till it joins that which runs along the hill sides, 
on the western side of the valley.
This road is to be 
followed up the valley ; and the tourist must lose none 
of its beauties.
Behind him, there are views of the 
receding lake, now diminished to the likeness of a cabinet 
picture : — below, is the deep vale with its green levels : 
opposite, the grassy slopes ascend to the ridges of High 
Street and Hill Bell; and before him, Troutbeck Tongue 
36 HIGHEST HOUSE.
protrudes, splitting the valley into two, and being itself 
most lovely with its farmstead, and dropped thorns, and 
coppice and grey rocks : while, behind and above it, the 
vale head rises into grandeur, with its torrents leaping 
down, and its pathway winding up, indicating the pass 
into Mardale.
The stranger is not going that way, 
however.
He turns over a gentler pass to the left, 
which leads him, on the slope of Wansfell, away from 
Troutbeck.
As he bids farewell to the Tongue, he sees 
the summit of Kirkstone before him.
He is passing 
over the somewhat boggy upland where the Stock takes 
its rise, to flow down to and through Ambleside, after 
having taken the leap called Stockghyll Force.
The 
tourist may see that in the evening, if there is time : — 
he is going the other way now.
His road meets the one from Ambleside at a small 
public-house, which the Ordnance Surveyors have 
declared the highest inhabited house in England : 
and thus it is labelled by a board over the porch.
In 
clear weather, the sea is seen hence, and the thread of 
smoke from its steamers.
The head of Windermere 
lies like a pond below : the little Blelham tarn, near 
Wray Castle, glitters behind ; and range beyond range 
of hills recedes to the horizon.
Near at hand, all is 
very wild.
The Ambleside road winds up steeply 
between grey rocks and moorland pasture, and dashing 
streams ; and the Kirkstone mountain has probably 
mists driving about its head.
There is something 
wilder to come, however, — the noted Kirkstone Pass, 
— the great pass of the district.
The descent begins 
about a quarter of a mile beyond the house.
Down 
PATTERDALE.
37 
plunges the road, with rock and torrent on either hand, 
and the bold sweeps of Coldfield and Scandale Screes 
shutting in the pass ; and the little lake of Brothers' 
Water lying below, afar off among the green levels ; 
and, closing in the whole in front, the mass of Place 
Fell, — the other side of which goes sheer down into 
Ullswater.
The stranger must not omit to observe near 
the head of the pass, the fallen rock, ridged like a roof, 
whose form (like that of a miniature church) has given 
its name to its precincts.
All the way as he descends 
to Brothers' Water, the openings on the Scandale side 
(the left) charm his eye, — with their fissures, preci- 
pices, green slopes and levels, and knolls in the midst, 
crowned with firs.
He passes through Hartsop, and 
then winds on, for three or four miles, among the rich 
levels of Patterdale, which is guarded by mountains 
jutting forwards, like promontories.
The Patterdale 
Inn, kept by Mr. Grelderd, is another of the first-rate 
hotels of the district.
The stranger, who must have 
left Windermere early in the morning, hastens to order 
a car or a boat, to take him to Growbarrow Park, and 
desires that dinner may await him in about three hours' 
time.
If the weather is calm and fine, he has a boat, to 
which he must walk across the mead<Mp. As soon as 
he is afloat, the beauties of UllswateSfcpen upon him, 
— the great Place Fell occupying the whole space 
to the right ; and Stybarrow Crag, precipitous and 
wooded, shoots up on the left-hand bank.
The road 
winds below it, under trees, passing good houses, and 
the paths to Helvellyn, and to the lead works, and to 
c2 
38 ltulph's tower.
Glencoin, -^ all recesses full of beauty.
Tales are told 
of artists who, turning into Glencoin, to find materials 
for a sketch, have not come out again for three months, 
finding themselves overwhelmed with tempting subjects 
for the pencil.
The singularly primitive character of 
the popular mind in those secluded corners is almost 
as great an incitement to study as the variety and 
richness of the foregrounds and the colouring.
Ullswater has two bends, and is shaped like a relaxed 
Z. At the first bend, the boat draws to shore, below 
Lyulph's Tower, an ivy-covered little castle, built for a 
shooting-box by the late Duke of Norfolk ; but it stands 
on the site of a real old tower, named, it is said, after 
the Ulf, or L'Ulf, the first Baron of Grey stoke, who 
gave its name to the lake.
Some, however, insist that 
the real name is Wolf's Tower.
The park which sur- 
rounds it, and stretches down to the lake, is studded 
with ancient trees ; and the sides of its watercourses, 
and the depths of its ravines, are luxuriantly wooded.
Vast hills, with climbing tracks, rise behind, on which 
the herds of deer are occasionally seen, like brown 
shadows from the clouds.
They are safe there from 
being startled (as they are in the glades of the park) 
by strangers who come to find out Ara Force by 
following the sound of the fall.
Our tourist must take 
a guide to this waterfall from the tower.
He will be led over the open grass to the ravine, and 
then along its wooded sides on a pathway above the 
brawling stream, till he comes to a bridge, which will 
bring him in full view of the fall.

cool damp nook at the bottom of the chasm, where the

echo of dashing and gurgling water never dies, and 
the ferns, long grasses and ash sprays wave and quiver 
everlastingly in the pulsing air ; and as, looking up, he 
sees the slender line of bridge spanning the upper fall, 
he ought to know of the mournful legend which belongs 
to this place, and which Wordsworth has preserved : — 
In the olden times, a knight who loved a lady, and 
courted her in her father's tower here, at Greystoke, 
went forth to win glory.
He won great glory : and at 
first his lady rejoiced fully in it : but he was so long in 
returning, and she heard so much of his deeds in behalf 
of distressed ladies, that doubts at length stole upon 
her heart as to whether he st'ill loved her.
These 
doubts disturbed her mind in sleep : and she began to 
walk in her dreams, directing her steps towards the 
waterfall where she and her lover used to meet.
Under 
a holly tree beside the fall they had plighted their 
vows, and this was the limit of her dreaming walks.
The knight at length returned to claim her.
Arriving 
in the night, he went to the ravine to rest under the 
holly until the morning should permit him to knock at 
the gate of the tower : but he saw a gliding white 
figure among the trees : and this figure reached the 
holly before him, and plucked twigs from the tree, and 
threw them into the stream.
Was it the ghost of his 
lady love ?
or was it herself ?
She stood in a dangerous 
place : he put out his hand to uphold her : the touch 
awakened her.
In her terror and confusion she fell 
from his grasp into the torrent, and was carried down 
the ravine.
He followed and rescued her ; but she died 
upon the bank; not, however, without having fully 
c 3 .

understood that her lover was true, and had come to 
claim her.
The knight devoted the rest of his days to 
mourn her : he built himself a cell upon the spot, and 
became a hermit for her sake.
The visitor should ascend the steps and pathway 
from the bottom of the fall, and stand on the bridge 
that spans the leap.
It is a grand thing to look down.
He returns the way he came, by boat, to the inn, and, 
after dinner up Kirkstone Pass.
He will hear and see 
enough to make him wish to come again, and stay 
awhile on Ullswater.
He would like to walk along 
Place Fell, above the margin of the lake, where no car- 
riage road is or can be made ; and, once there, he would 
certainly climb the mountain.
He would like to enter 
the bridle road, from the foot of the lake, which leads 
to Grisedale tarn, and comes out above Grasmere.
He 
would like to visit Angle Tarn, on the southern end of 
Place Fell ; and, yet more, Hays Water, the large lonely 
tarn above Hartsop ; where the angler delights to 
seclude himself, because the trout delights in it too.
It 
is a high treat to follow up the beck from the road, 
winding among the farms, and then entering the soli- 
tude of the pass, till the source of the stream is found 
in this tarn, a mile and a-half from the main road.
The 
little lake is overhung by High Street, so that the 
Eoman eagles, as well as the native birds of the rocks, 
may have cast their shadows upon its surface.
Its 
rushy and rocky margin is as wild a place as the most 
adventurous angler can ever have found himself in.
Our 
traveller must, however, come again to see it ; for there 
is no time to diverge to it to-day.
AMBLESIDE.
41 
At the house, at the top of the pass, (which he has 
walked up, in mercy to his horses) he leaves the Trout- 
beck road to the left, and descends rapidly upon 
Ambleside, which is between three and four miles from 
the house.
On the left, is the valley or ravine of the 
Stock, whose waters are concealed by wood.
The road 
runs along the slopes of the Scandale Fells.
Below, 
Windermere opens more and more ; and at length, the 
pretty little town of Ambleside appears, nestling at the 
foot of Wansfell, and the valley of the Eothay opens at 
the gazer's feet.
On the opposite margin of this green 
recess, and on the skirts of Loughrigg, he sees Fox 
How, the residence and favourite retirement of the late 
Dr. Arnold, and now inhabited by his family.
Near 
the pass which opens between Loughrigg and Fairfield, 
he is told that the residence of Wordsworth may be 
seen from below.
Just under him to the left is the old 
church ; and near the centre of the valley is the new 
church, — more of a blemish than an adornment, un- 
happily, from its size and clumsiness, and the bad taste 
of its architecture.
Though placed in a valley, it has 
a spire, — the appropriate form of churches in a level 
country ; and the spire is of a different color from the 
rest of the building ; and the east window is remarkably 
ugly.
There have been various reductions of the 
beauty of the valley within twenty years or so ; and 
this latest is the worst, because the most conspicuous.
The old church, though not beautiful, is suitable to the 
position, and venerable by its ancient aspect.
It is 
abundantly large enough for the place, except for a few 
weeks in summer : but its burial ground, inclosed by 
42 AMBLESIDE.
roads on three sides, has for many years been over- 
crowded.
Ten years ago, the state of the churchyard, 
and the health of the people who lived near it, was such 
as to make the opening of a new burial-ground a press- 
ing matter ; and hence, no doubt, arose the new church, 
though a larger and more beautiful cemetery might 
easily have been formed in the neighbourhood.
The descent to all the Ambleside inns is steep, — 
past the old church, and through a narrow street, and 
into the space dignified with the name of the market- 
place, and actually exhibiting an ancient market-cross.
Half-a-dozen of the few shops of the town are in or 
about the market-place, and the Salutation and Com- 
mercial Inns and the White Lion, — the three princi- 
pal inns, are all conspicuous in it.
If his time in 
Ambleside is precious, the stranger may use the sunset 
or twilight hour for seeing Stoekghyll Force, while his 
supper is preparing.
He is directed or guided through 
the stable-yard of the Salutation Inn, when he passes 
under a tall grove of old trees on the right hand, the 
stream being on the left.
On the opposite bank is the 
bobbin-mill, the one industrial establishment of Amble- 
side, placed there on account of the abundant supply of 
coppice wood obtainable in the neighbourhood.
The 
stacks of wood are seen, high up on the bank ; and the 
ivy-clad dwelling of the proprietor ; and then the great 
water-wheel, with its attendant spouts and weir, and 
sound of gushing and falling waters.
Where the path 
forks towards and away from the stream, the visitor 
must take the left-hand one.
The other is the way up 
WansfelL His path leads him under trees, and up and 
STOCKGHYLL FORCE.
43 
through a charming wood, with the water dashing 
and brawling further and further below, till his ear 
catches the sound of the fall : and presently after, the 
track turns to the left, and brings him to a rocky station 
whence he has a full view of the force.
It is the fashion 
to speak lightly of this waterfall, — it being within 
half-a-mile of the inn, and so easily reached ; but it is, 
in our opinion, a very remarkable fall, (from the symme- 
try of its parts,) and one of the most graceful that can 
be seen.
Its leap, of about seventy feet, is split by a 
rocky protrusion, and intercepted by a ledge running 
across; so that there are four falls, — two smaller ones 
above, answering precisely to each other, and two larger 
leaps below, no less exactly resembling.
The rock 
which parts them is feathered with foliage ; and so are 
the sides of the ravine.
Below, the waters unite in a 
rocky basin, whence they flow down to the mill, and on 
in a most picturesque torrent, through a part of Amble- 
side, and into the meadows, where they make their last 
spring down a rock near Millar Bridge, and join the 
Rothay about a mile from the lake.
Supposing the excursion to Patterdale to be left for 
another day, the stranger will see, after turning into the • 
Ambleside road from Bowness, first, Ibbotsholme, on 
the right, the residence of Samuel Taylor, Esq., just 
beyond Troutbeck Bridge.
Presently, he will pass on 
the left hand, the gate of Calgarth, Bishop Watson's 
house, now inhabited by Edward Swinburne, Esq.
Ecclerigg, the residence of Ed. Luther Watson, Esq., 
comes next : and then Lowwood Inn, Dove's Nest, and 
Wansfell Holme, and, on the opposite shore, Wray 
44 DOTS AND BATHS.
Castle, all of which have been mentioned as seen from 
the lake.
Clappersgate, with its white houses, nestles 
under Loughrigg, at the head of the lake ; and the 
Brathay valley, with its pretty little church on its knoll, 
opens beautifully as seen from the toll-bar.
From 
Water-head to Ambleside, .
there are residences, humble 
or handsome, on either hand.
The traveller can hardly 
be wrong in his choice of an inn, as all three are comfort- 
able and well served.
At present there are no baths in 
the place ; — a singular deficiency where there is so 
much of company on the one hand and of water on 
the other.
The inconvenience is, however, in the way 
of being remedied ; and it is to be hoped that another 
season will not arrive without a provision of this needful 
refreshment for the dusty and tired traveller, — to say 
nothing of the residents, who must desire it for pur- 
poses of health as well as enjoyment.

The stranger had better take an entire day for this 
tour also, if he can spare the time, and means to see 
Easedale at his ease.
The distance in miles is not a 
day's journey ; but there are things to see which deserve 
a pause.
The road to the right, after leaving the little market 
place, is the one to be taken.
Between Eothay Cottage 
and Eothay Bank, the residence of John Crosfield, Esq., 
the road turns upon Kothay Bridge, whence there is a 
fine view of the valley, with the cul-de-sac of Fairfield 
closing it in to the north.
Whether the vapours are 
gathering and tumbling in that basin, — the recess of 
Fairfield, — or whether every projection, streak, slide, 
and mossy tract is clearly visible, that northern barrier 
is very imposing ; and perhaps most so to those who are 
most familiar with it, and can read its manifold weather 
signs and tokens.
Between Eothay Bridge and Clap- 
46 BRATHAY CHURCHYARD.
persgate is Croft Lodge, the residence of James Holme, 
Esq.
; — the mansion and its woods being on the right 
of the road, and the gardens stretching down to the 
river on the left.
Then comes the pretty hamlet of 
Clappersgate, so conspicuous from the lake; and two 
roads branch off, leading along each bank of the river 
Brathay, and meeting at Skelwith Bridge at the other 
end of the valley.
If the stranger has any thought of 
ascending Loughrigg, some other day, he may now see, 
above Clappersgate, the path by which he may ascend 
or descend ; a zig-zag path up the hill side, leading to 
the two peaks, crowning the south end of Loughrigg, 
from between which the most perfect possible view of 
Windermere is obtained.
That cannot, however, be 
done to-day.
The left-hand road should now be taken, 
crossing Brathay Bridge, and passing the parson- 
age.
When the stranger sees the churchyard gate, he 
must alight, and walk up to the church.
From the 
rock there he commands the mountain range from Con- 
iston Old Man to the Langdale Pikes : the Brathay 
flows beneath, through its quiet meadows ; and its 
dashing among the rocks, just under his feet, catches 
his ear ; — Loughrigg, with its copses and crags and 
purple heather, rises immediately before him : and to 
the right he sees a part of Ambleside nestling between 
the hills, and a stretch of the lake.
This churchyard 
has the first daffodils and snowdrops on the southern 
side of its rock ; and, in its copse, the earliest wood 
anemones.
Throughout the valley, spring flowers, and 
the yellow and white broom abound.
The road ascends and descends abruptly, and winds 
LOUGHRIGG TARiN".
' 47 
towards, and away from, the right bank of the Brathay, 
till it reaches Skelwith Fold.
There the stranger must 
alight again, and go through a field gate to the right, 
to a rocky point, where he commands the finest view 
of the valley and its environs.
And again, just before 
he comes to Skelwith Bridge, he must go through the 
gap in the wall to the left, and follow the field-track 
until he comes in sight of Skelwith Force.
He will 
hardly aver that he ever saw a more perfect picture than 
this, — with the fall in the centre, closed in by rock 
and wood on either hand, and by the Langdale Pikes 
behind.
Keturning to his car, he will next pass over 
the bridge, and the roaring torrent beneath, and by 
stacks of wood, — (more coppice wood for another 
bobbin-mill,) and, turning to the right, will find that 
he has headed the valley.
As he is not going home, 
however, but to Grasmere, he turns out of the Brathay 
valley by a steep road on the left, which ascends again 
and again, leading by farmsteads almost as primitive as 
those of Troutbeck, and evidently mounting the spurs 
of Loughrigg, — which he is travelling round to-day, 
and which must therefore be always on his right hand.
After a while, he comes to a sheet of water, so still, if 
the day be calm, that he might possibly miss it, unless 
the precision of the reflections should strike his eye.
It is more likely, however, to be rippled by some breeze, 
and to show how deeply blue, or darkly grey, these 
mountain tarns may be.
This is Loughrigg tarn, well 
known to all readers of Wordsworth.
At some little 
distance beyond it, the stranger must diverge from his 
road to visit High Close, and see the view which is re- 
48 LAKGDALE.
puted the finest in Westmorland.
He may leave his 
car where the road to High Close ascends to the left, 
and walk to the farm-house at the top.
As there are 
probably lodgers, he had better not present himself at 
the garden door, but go on to the farmyard gate, pass 
through the yard to the field, and walk along the brow 
till he reaches the grey stone bench.
There he is !
overlooking "the finest view in Westmorland." To 
the extreme right, Bowfell closes in the Langdale 
valley, the head of which is ennobled by the swelling 
masses of the Pikes.
A dark cleft in the nearer one is 
the place where the celebrated Dungeon Ghyll Force is 
plunging and foaming, beyond the reach of e}^e and ear.
He can gather from this station, something of the 
character of Langdale.
It has levels, here expanding, 
there contracting ; and the stream winds among them 
from end to end.
There is no lake : and the mountains 
send out spurs, alternating or meeting, so as to make 
the levels sometimes circular and sometimes winding.
The dwellings are on the rising grounds which skirt the 
levels ; and this, together with the paving of the road 
below, shows that the valley is subject to floods.
The 
houses, of grey-stone, each on its knoll, with a canopy 
of firs and sycamores above it, and ferns scattered all 
around, and ewes and lambs nestling near it, — these 
primitive farms are cheerful and pleasant objects to look 
upon, whether from above or passing among them.
•Nearer at hand are some vast quarries of blue slate.
Below, among plantations, are seen the roofs of the 
Elterwater Powder Mills ; whence the road winds 
through the village of Langdale Chapel, to the margin 
EED BANK.
49 
of the pools which make up the lake.
From their 
opposite shore rise the hills, height above height, — 
range beyond range.
To the left lies Loughrigg Tarn, 
and, in the distance,* Windermere, with Wray Castle 
prominent on its height, and the Lancashire hills clos- 
ing in the view.
It is a singular prospect, at once noble 
and lovely ; and the comfortable lodgings at High Close 
farm are in request accordingly.
The car is waiting where the traveller left it ; but he 
had better walk for half-a-mile or so, — the descent of 
Red Bank being very steep.
The great mountain that 
swells so grandly above the rest before him is Helvellyn.
The lake that opens below is Grasmere, with its one 
island, made up of green slope, black fir clump, and grey 
barn.
At the further end lies the village, with its old 
square church tower, beneath whose shadow Words- 
worth is buried.
The white road that winds like a 
ribbon up and up the gap between Helvellyn and the 
opposite fells is the mail road to Keswick, and the gap 
is Dunmail Raise.
The remarkable and beautiful hill 
behind the village is Helm Crag ; and its rocky crest 
forms the group called the Lion and the Lamb.
The 
long white house, near the foot of Helvellyn, is the 
Swan Inn, whence Scott, Southey, and Wordsworth, 
set forth on ponies for the ascent of the mountain : and 
behind it rises the path by which pedestrians come from 
Grasmere to Patterdale, by the margin of Grisedale 
tarn, — the mountain tarn of the wild boar, as the 
words properly signify.
To the left of Helm Crag, a 
deep valley evidently opens.
That is Easedale ; and 
there our tourist is to go to-day.
Meantime, let him 
50 GRASMERE INNS.
linger awhile, that he may learn by heart every feature 
of this gay and lovely scene.
The lane he has just 
passed to the right leads him to the grassy bridle-road 
called Loughrigg Terrace, whence the best views are 
obtained of both Grasmere and Rydal lakes, and which 
leads along the uplands and then by Eydal Lake back 
to the valley of the Rothay.
We must leave it now, and 
plunge down Eed Bank, which has the characteristics 
of a Norwegian road." At the cistern at- the bottom, 
the stranger enters his car, and passes farm houses 
between him and the lake, and villas on the rocky and 
wooded bank on the left ; and, at the corner, where the 
road turns to the village, the cluster of lodging-houses, 
called St. Oswald's, where the Hydropathic Establish- 
ment struggled on for a time, but found the Westmor- 
land winters too long for invalids.
The driver must stop at the Red Lion, to order 
dinner.
It is an old-fashioned little place, where the 
traveller's choice is usually between ham and eggs and 
eggs and ham ; with the addition, however, of cheese 
and oat cake.
He goes to the Red Lion now merely 
because it is on the way to his destination.
If he were 
going to stay at Grasmere, he would take up his abode 
at the Hotel kept by Mr. Brown.
The beauty of the 
view from that house is evident at a glance ; and good 
accommodations will be found within, with ample 
means of conveyance of all kinds.
Whatever the 
dinner at the Red Lion is to be, it must not be 
ready under two or three hours ; — rather three 
than two.
He proceeds for a mile between fences 
before he reaches the opening of Easedale.
The gate 
EASEDALE TARN.

and shrubbery to the right are the entrance to Lady 
Kichardson's cottage ; and there the regular road ends.
The car can go about a mile further along the farm 
tracks in the valley, through the meadows which yield 
a coarse hay, and near the stream which is tufted with 
alders.
At the farm house where the car stops, the 
people will shew the stranger the way he must go, — 
past the plantation, and up the hill side, where he will 
find the track that will guide him up to the waterfall, 
— the foaming cataract which is seen all over the valley, 
and is called Sour Milk Ghyll Force.
The water and 
the track together will shew him the way to the tarn, 
which is the source of the stream.
Up and on he goes, 
over rock and through wet moss, with long stretches of 
dry turf and purple heather ; and at last, when he is 
heated and breathless, the dark cool recess opens in 
which lies Easedale Tarn.
Perhaps there is an angler 
standing besides the great boulder on the brink.
Per- 
haps there is a shepherd lying among the ferns.
But 
more probably the stranger finds himself perfectly alone.
There is perhaps nothing in natural scenery which 
conveys such an impression of stillness as tarns which 
lie under precipices : and here the rocks sweep down to 
the brink almost round the entire margin.
For hours 
together the deep shadows move only like the gnomon 
of the sundial ; and, when movement occurs, it is not 
such as disturbs the sense of repose; — the dimple 
made by a restless fish or fly, or the gentle flow of 
water in or out ; or the wild drake and his brood, pad- 
dling so quietly as not to break up the mirror, or the 
reflection of some touch of sunlight, or passing shadow.
D 
52 WOEDSWOETH's GEAVE; 
If there is commotion from gusts or eddies of wind, 
the effect is even more remarkable.
Little white clouds 
are driven against the rocks, — the spray is spilled in 
unexpected places ; now the precipices are wholly 
veiled, and there is nothing but the ruffled water to be 
seen : and again, in an instant, the rocks are disclosed 
so fearfully that they seem to be crowding together to 
crush the intruder.
If this seems to the inexperienced 
like extravagance, let him go alone to Easedale Tarn, or 
to Angle Tarn on Bowfell, on a gusty day, and see 
what he will find.
After his return to the Bed Lion, and his dinner, the 
stranger will go to the churchyard.
In the church is 
a medallion portrait of Wordsworth, accompanied by 
an inscription adapted from a dedication of Mr. Keble's.
The simple and modest tombstone in the churchyard 
will please him better.
At present it bears only the 
name of the poet, — in his case, an all-sufficient memo- 
rial : but it is understood that some dates and other 
particulars will be filled in hereafter.
Beside him lies 
his only daughter, and next to her, her husband, — 
whose first wife is next him on the other side.
Some 
other children of Wordsworth, who died young, are 
buried near ; and one grandchild.
Close behind the 
family group lies Hartley Coleridge, at whose funeral 
the white-haired Wordsworth attended, not very long 
before his own death.
This spot, under the yews, be- 
sides the gushing Bothay and encircled by green 
mountains, is a fitting resting-place for the poet of the 
region.
He chose it himself; and every one rejoices 
that he did.
EYDAL LAKE.
53 
Just after entering the mail road, the driver will 
point out the cottage in which the poet and his sister 
lived, many long years ago, when Scott was their guest.
Several good houses have sprung up near it, within a 
few years.
The promontory which here causes the lake 
to contract to the little river (which is called the 
Rothay in all the intervals of the chain of lakes,) may 
be passed in three ways.
The mail road runs round its 
point, and therefore keeps beside the water ; — the 
Roman road, where the Wishing Grate used to be, 
crosses it by a rather steep ascent and descent ; — and 
a shorter road still, steeper and boggy, cuts across its 
narrowest part, and comes out at the Rydal Quarries.
Our traveller will take the mail road, probably.
It will 
soon bring him to Rydal Lake ; and he cannot but 
think the valley very lovely in the summer afternoon.
On the opposite side of the lake is Loughrigg, with its 
terrace- walk distinctly visible half-way up.
The islands 
are wooded ; and on one of them is a heronry ; and the 
grey bird, with its long napping wings, is most likely 
visible, either in flight, or perched on a tree near its 
nest, or fishing in the shallows.
Nab Scar, the blunt 
end of Fairfield, which overlooks the road and the lake, 
is very fine with its water-worn channels, its wood, and 
grey rocks.
Nab Cottage, the humble white house by 
the road side, and on the margin of the lake, is the 
place where Hartley Coleridge lived and died.
In the 
distance, Ivy Cottage peeps out of the green ; and fur- 
ther on, Rydal Chapel rises out of the foliage on the 
verge of the park.
When the turn to the left, which leads up to that 
J)2 
54 WORDSWORTH' S GARDEN.
chapel, is readied, the stranger must alight, and ascend 
it.
He is ascending Rydal Mount : and Wordsworth's 
house is at the top of the hill, — within the modest 
gate on the left.
If the family should be absent, the 
traveller may possibly obtain entrance, and stand on 
the mossgrown eminence, (like a little Roman camp,) 
in front of the house, whence he may view the whole 
valley of the Roth ay to the utmost advantage.
Win- 
dermere in the distance is, as Wordsworth used to say, 
a light thrown into the picture, in the winter season, 
and, in summer, a beautiful feature, changing with 
every hue of the sky.
The whole garden is a true 
poet's garden ; its green hollows, its straight terraces, 
bordered with beds of periwinkle, and tall foxgloves, 
purple and white, — (the white being the poet's 
favourite) ; and then the summer house, — (now, how- 
ever, damp and dreary, with the fircones that line it 
dropping out of their places) ; and then the opening of 
the door, which discloses the other angle of the pros- 
pect, — Rydal Pass, with the lake lying below.
Every 
resident in the neighbourhood thinks the situation of 
his own house the best : but most agree that Words- 
worth's comes next.
We should say that Words- 
worth's came next to Mr. Sheldon's at Miller Brow, 
but for the great disadvantage of the long and steep 
ascent to it.
That ascent is a serious last stage of a 
walk on a hot summer day ; but the privileges of the 
spot, when once reached, are almost incomparable.
The guide to the Rydal Falls will by this time have 
presented herself, and the tourist must visit them.
They are within the park, and cannot be seen without 
• 
BYDAL FALLS.
55 
a guide : but some one is always to be found at one of 
the two guides' cottages on the ascent of the hill.
The upper fall is the finest, in the eyes of those who 
prefer the most natural accessaries of a cascade : but 
the lower is the one generally represented by artists, — 
the summer-house from which it is viewed affording an 
admirable picture- frame, and the basin of rock, and the 
bridge above, constituting, in truth, a very perfect 
picture.
When there is a dash of sunshine on the ver- 
dure, behind and under the bridge, to contrast with the 
shadowy basin and pool of the fall, the subject is tempt- 
ing enough to the artist.
These falls seen, the tourist need alight from his car 
no more, for he is only a mile and a-half from Amble- 
side.
He presently passes Pelter Bridge, which spans 
the Eothay on the right.
That is the way to Fox 
How : and he presently sees Fox How, — the grey 
house embosomed in trees, — at the foot of Loughrigg.
He must not mistake for it the gem of a house that he 
sees, — the cream-coloured one, veiled in roses, with the 
conservatories beside it, just under the wooded preci- 
pice : — that is Foxghyll, the residence of Hornby 
Eoughsedge, Esq. To the left, there are good views of 
Eydal Park.
Approaching Ambleside, the first house 
to the left is Lesketh How, the residence of Dr. Davy : 
the white house to the right is Tranby Lodge, the 
abode of Alfred Barkworth, Esq.
: and the house on the 
rising ground behind the chapel is the Knoll, the resi- 
dence of Miss.
H. Martineau.
The gates on the left 
are those of Green Bank, the estate of Benson Harrison, 
Esq.

side is that of James C.

The stream to the right is the Stock, making its way 
to the river: and the odd little grey dwelling "built 
above it is the ancient house which is considered the 
most curious relic in Ambleside of the olden time.
The 
view of the mill and the rocky channel of the Stock on 
the left of the bridge is the one which every artist 
sketches as he passes by ; and if there is in the Exhibi- 
tion in London, in any year, a view at Ambleside, it is 
probably this.
The Kirkstone road now joins the mail 
road, and the tourist finds himself on old ground, — in 
Ambleside market-place.
A DAY ON THE MOUNTAINS.
The stranger has now made his three tours.
There 
is one thing more that he must do before he goes on 
into Cumberland.
He must spend a day on the Moun- 
tains : and if alone, so much the better.
If he knows 
what it is to spend a day so far above the every-day 
world, he is aware that it is good to be alone, (unless 
there is danger in the case) ; and, if he is a novice, let 
him try whether it be not so.
Let him go forth early, 
with a stout stick in his hand, provision for the day in 
his knapsack or his pocket ; and, if he chooses, a book : 
but we do not think he will read to-day.
A map is 
essential, to explain to him what he sees : and it is very 
well to have a pocket compass, in case of sudden fog, 
or any awkward doubt about the way.
In case of an 
ascent of a formidable mountain, like Scawfell or Hel- 
vellyn, it is rash to go without a guide : but our tourist 
shall undertake something more moderate, and reason- 
ably safe, for a beginning.
What mountain shall it be?
He might go up 
Blackcombe, on his way to or from Furness : and from 
thence he might see, in fair weather, as Wordsworth 
tells us, "a more extensive view than from any other 
point in Britain," — seven English counties, and seven 
58 CHOICE OE A MOUNTAIN.
Scotch, a good deal of Wales, the Isle of Man, and in 
some lucky moment, just before sunrise (as the Ordnance 
surveyors say) the coast of Ireland.
This is very fine ; 
but it is hardly what is looked for in the lake district, 
— the sea being the main feature.
He might go up 
the Old Man from Coniston ; but there are the copper 
works, and there is the necessity of a guide : and it is a 
long way to go for the day's treat.
If he ascends the 
Langdale Pikes, it had better be from some interior 
station ; and the rest of the great peaks will be best 
commanded from Keswick.
Of those within reach of 
Ambleside, which shall it be ?
Loughrigg is very easy 
and very charming ; but it is not commanding enough.
From the surrounding heights it looks like a mere 
rambling hill.
Wansfell is nearest, and also easy and 
safe.
It may be reached by a charming walk from 
Low Wood Inn, and descended by the Stockghyll lane, 
above Ambleside.
The immediate neighbourhood is 
mapped out below ; and there is a long and wide open- 
ing to the south : but to the north-east, and everywhere 
round the head of the lake, the view is stopped, first by 
Nab Scar, and then by other heights.
Why should it 
not be Nab Scar itself ?
or, the whole of Fairfield ?
That excursion is safe, not over fatiguing, practicable 
for a summer day, and presenting scenery as character- 
istic as can be found.
Let it be Fairfield.
The stranger should ascend to the ridge, either 
through Bydal forest, (for which leave is requisite, and 
not always easily obtained,) or by the road to 
the Nook which anybody will shew him.
The 
Nook is a farmhouse in a glorious situation as he will

see when he gets there and steps into the field on the 
left, to look abroad from the brow.
He then passes 
under its old trees to where the voice of falling waters 
calls him onward.
Scandale Beck comes tumbling 
down its rocky channel, close at hand.
He must cross 
the bridge, and follow the cart-road, which brings him 
out at once upon the fells.
What he has to aim at is 
the ridge above Bydal forest or park, from whence his 
way is plain, — round the whole cul-de-sac of Fairfield, 
to Nab Scar.
He sees it all ; and the only thing is to 
do it : and we know of no obstacle to his doing it, unless 
it be the stone wall which divides the Scandale from the 
Rydal side of the ridge.
These stone walls are an in- 
convenience to pedestrians, and a great blemish in the 
eyes of strangers.
In the first place, however, it is to 
be said that an open way is almost invariably left, up 
every mountain, if the rover can but find it ; and, in 
the next place, the ugliness of these climbing fences 
disappears marvellously when the stranger learns how 
they came there.
— In the old times, when there were 
wolves, and when the abbots of the surrounding Norman 
monasteries encouraged their tenants to approach nearer 
and nearer to the Saxon fastnesses, the shepherds were 
allowed to inclose crofts about their hillside huts, for 
the sake of browsing their flocks on the sprouts of the 
ash and holly with which the hillsides were then 
wooded, and of protecting the sheep from the wolves 
which haunted the thickets.
The inclosures certainly 
spread up the mountain sides, at this day, to a height 
where they would not be seen if ancient custom had 
not drawn the lines which are thus preserved ; and it 
60 EYDAL PAEK.
appears, from historical testimony, that these fences 
existed before the fertile valleys were portioned out 
among many holders.
Higher and higher ran these 
stone inclosures, — threading the woods, and joining on 
upon the rocks.
Now, the woods are for the most part 
gone ; and the walls offend and perplex the stranger's 
eye and mind by their unsightliness and apparent use- 
lessness ; but it is a question whether, their origin once 
known, they would be willingly parted with, — remind- 
ing us as they do of the times when the tenants of the 
abbots or military nobles formed a link between the 
new race of inhabitants and the Saxon remnant of the 
old.
One of these walls it is which runs along the 
ridge and bounds Rydal Park.
There may be a gate in 
it ; or one which enables the stranger to get round it.
If not, he must get over it ; and, if he does so, high 
enough up, it may save him another climb.
The 
nearer the ridge, the fewer the remaining walls between 
him and liberty.
Once in the forest, Christopher 
North's advice comes into his mind, — unspoiled by the 
fear, only too reasonable in the lower part of the park, 
— of being turned out of the paradise, very summarily.
"The sylvan, or rather, the forest scenery of Rydal 
Park," says Professor Wilson, "was, in the memory of 
living man, magnificent ; and it still contains a treasure 
of old trees.
By all means wander away into these old 
woods, and lose yourself for an hour or two among the 
cooing of cushats and the shrill shriek of startled 
blackbirds, and the rustle of the harmless glow-worm 
among the last year's beech leaves.
No very great 
harm should you even fall asleep under the shadow of 
MOUNTAIN SOLITUDE.
61 
an oak, whilst the magpie chatters at safe distance^ and 
the more innocent squirrel peeps down upon you from 
a bough of the canopy, and then, hoisting his tail, 
glides into the obscurity of the loftiest umbrage." — 
Ascending from these shades through a more straggling 
woodland, the stranger arrives at a clump on the ridge, 
— the last clump, and thenceforth feels himself wholly 
free.
His foot is on the springy mountain moss ; and 
many a cushion of heather tempts him to sit down and 
look abroad.
There may still be a frightened cow or 
two, wheeling away, with tail aloft, as he comes on- 
wards ; and a few sheep are still crouching in the 
shadows of the rocks, or staring at him from the knolls.
If he plays the child and bleats, he will soon see how 
many there are.
It is one of the amusements of a good 
mimic in such places to bring about him all the animals 
there are, by imitating their cries.
One may assemble 
a flock of sheep, and lead them far out of bounds in this 
way ; and bewildered enough they look when the bleat 
ceases, and they are left to find their way back again.
It is in such places as this that the truth of some of 
Wordsworth's touches may be recognised, which are 
most amusing to cockney readers.
Perhaps no passage 
has been more ridiculed than that which tells of the 
"solemn bleat' ' of 
" a lamb left somewhere to itself, 
The plaintive spirit of the solitude/' 
The laughers are thinking of a cattle market, or a 
flock of sheep on a dusty road ; and they know nothing 
of the effect of a single bleat of a stray lamb high up 
on the mountains.
If they had ever felt the profound 
62 RAIN GUAGES.
stillness of the higher fells, or heard it broken by the 
plaintive cry, repeated and not answered, they would 
be aware that there is a true solemnity in the sound.
Still further on, when the sheep are all left behind, 
he may see a hawk perched upon a great boulder.
He 
will see it take flight when he comes near, and cleave 
the air below him, and hang above the woods, — to the 
infinite terror, as he knows, of many a small creature 
there, and then whirl away to some distant part of the 
park.
Perhaps a heavy buzzard may rise, flapping, 
from its nest on the moor, or pounce from a crag in the 
direction of any water-birds that may be about the 
springs and pools in the hills.
There is no other sound, 
unless it be the hum of the gnats in the hot sunshine.
There is an aged man in the district, however, who 
hears more than this, and sees more than people below 
would, perhaps, imagine.
An old shepherd has the 
charge of four rain guages which are set up on four 
ridges, — desolate, misty spots, sometimes below and 
often above the clouds.
He visits each once a month, 
and notes down what these guages record ; and when 
the tall old man, with his staff, passes out of sight into 
the cloud, or among the cresting rocks, it is a striking 
thought that science has set up a tabernacle in these 
wildernesses, and found a priest among the shepherds.
That old man has seen and heard wonderful things : — 
has trod upon rainbows, and been waited upon by a 
dim retinue of spectral mists.
He has seen the hail 
and the lightnings go forth as from under his hand, 
and has stood in the sunshine, listening to the thunder 
growling, and the tempest bursting beneath his feet.
FAIKFIELD.
63 
He well knows the silence of the hills, and all the solemn 
ways in which that silence is broken.
The stranger, 
however, coming hither on a calm summer day may 
well fancy that a silence like this can never be broken.
Looking abroad, what does he see ?
The first im- 
pression probably is of the billowy character of the 
mountain groups around and below him.
This is per- 
haps the most striking feature of such a scene to a 
novice ; and the next is the flitting character of the 
mists.
One ghostly peak after another seems to rise 
out of its shroud; and then the shroud winds itself 
round another.
Here the mist floats over a valley; 
there it reeks out of a chasm : here it rests upon a 
green slope ; there it curls up a black precipice.
The 
sunny vales below look like a paradise, with their bright 
meadows and waters and shadowy woods, and little 
knots of villages.
To the south there is the glittering 
sea ; and the estuaries of the Leven and Duddon, with 
their stretches of yellow sands.
To the east there is a 
sea of hill tops.
On the north, Ullswater appears, 
grey and calm at the foot of black precipices ; and 
nearer may be traced the whole pass from Patter- 
dale, where Brothers' Water lies invisible from hence.
The finest point of the whole excursion is about the 
middle of the cul-de-sac, where, on the northern sides, 
there are tremendous precipices, overlooking Deepdale, 
and other sweet recesses far below.
Here, within hear- 
ing of the torrents which tumble from those precipices, 
the rover should rest.
He will see nothing so fine as 
the contrast of this northern view with the long green 
slope on the other side, down to the source of Bydal 
64 TEN" LAKES AKD TARNS.
Beck, and then down and down to Bydal Woods and 
Mount.
He is now 2,950 feet above the sea level ; and 
he has surely earned his meal.
If the wind troubles 
him, he can doubtless find a sheltered place under a 
rock.
If he can sit on the bare ridge, he is the more 
fortunate.
The further he goes, the more amazed he is at the 
extent of the walk, which looked such a trifle from be- 
low.
Waking out of a reverie, an hour after dinner, he 
sees that the sun is some way down the western sky.
He hastens on, not heeding the boggy spaces, and 
springing along the pathless heather and moss, seeing 
more and more lakes and tarns every quarter of an 
hour.
In the course of the day he sees ten.
Winder- 
mere, and little Blelham Tarn beyond, he saw first.
Ullswater was below him to the north when he dined ; 
and, presently after, a tempting path guided his eye to 
Grisedale Tarn, lying in the pass from Patterdale to 
Grasmere.
Here are four.
Next, comes G-rasmere, 
with Easedale Tarn above it, in its mountain hollow : 
then Eydal, of course, at his feet ; and Elterwater 
beyond the western ridges ; and finally, to the south- 
west, Esthwaite Water and Coniston.
There are the 
ten.
Eight of these may be seen at once from at least 
one point — Nab Scar, whence he must take his last 
complete survey ; for from hence he must plunge down 
the steep slope, and bid farewell to all that lies behind 
the ridge.
The day has gone like an hour.
The sun- 
shine is leaving the surface of the nearer lakes, and the 
purple bloom of the evening is on the further moun- 
tains ; and the gushes of yellow light between the 
EETUEN.
65 
western passes show that sunset is near.
He must 
hasten down, — mindful of the opening between the 
fences, which he remarked from below, and which, if he 
finds, he cannot lose his way.
He does not seriously 
lose his way, though crag and bog make him diverge 
now and then.
Descending between the inclosures, he 
sits down once or twice, to relieve the fatigue to the 
ancle and instep of so continuous a descent, and to 
linger a little over the beauty of the evening scene.
As 
he comes down into the basin where Eydal Beck makes 
its last gambols and leaps, before entering the park, he 
is sensible of the approach of night.
Loughrigg seems 
to rise : the hills seem to close him in, and the twilight 
to settle down.
He comes to a gate, and finds himself 
in the civilised world again.
He descends the green 
lane at the top of Eydal Mount, comes out just above 
Wordsworth's gate, finds his car at the bottom of the 
hill, — (the driver beginning to speculate on whether 
any accident has befallen the gentleman on the hills,) — 
is driven home, and is amazed, on getting out, to find 
how stiff and tired he is.
He would not, however, but 
have spent such a day for ten times the fatigue.
He 
will certainly ascend Helvellyn, and every other moun- 
tain that comes in his wav.

Some call Ambleside the head quarters of the lake 
district, and others Keswick.
It is not necessary to 
settle this point of precedence here.
Having treated of 
Ambleside first, because the tourist arrived there first, 
Keswick claims the next notice.
The road from Ambleside to Keswick has already 
fallen under our observation as far as Grasmere, and its 
conspicuous white inn, the Swan.
That inn had the 
honour of providing Scott with a daily draught of some- 
thing good, when he was, in his early days, the guest 
of Wordsworth and his sister at Grasmere, — their 
board being conscientiously humble, as they used to 
tell, to a degree, which did not suit the taste of their 
E 
68 DUNMAIL BAISE.
guest.
By some device or another, Scott managed to 
pay a daily visit to the Swan without his friends being 
aware of it.
But, when he, Wordsworth, and Southey 
were to ascend Helvellyn, mounting their ponies at the 
Swan, the host saw their approach, and cried out to 
Scott, " Eh, sir !
you've come early for your drink to- 
day." It was a complete escape of the cat from the 
bag ; but Wordsworth was not one to be troubled by 
such a discovery.
No doubt he took the unlucky 
speech more serenely than his guest.
From the Swan, the road to Keswick ascends Dun- 
mail Baise ; — a steep pitch of road, though its highest 
point is only 720 feet above the sea.
On the right 
there is a stream which divides the counties of Cumber- 
land and Westmorland; and on either hand rise the 
mountains of Steel Fell and Seat Sandal.
The cairn, 
— a rude mass of stones near the top of the ascent, 
which the stranger should be on the look out for, 
marks the spot of a critical conflict in the olden time, — 
that is, in A.D. 945, — when the Anglo Saxon King 
Edmund defeated and slew Dunmail, the British King 
of Cumbria, and then put out the eyes of the two sons 
of his slain foe, and gave their inheritance to Malcolm, 
King of Scotland.
At the Nag's Head, the little inn which is about a 
mile and a-quarter further on, the traveller must decide 
on one of three courses, — as politicians are wont to do.
He may go up Helvellyn, or he may bowl along on the 
high road, straight through Legberthwaite, and imme- 
diately under Helvellyn ; or he may go on foot, or on a 
pony, round the western side of the lake, which is 
THIRLMEEE.
69 
known by the various names of Wythburn Water, 
Leathes Water, and Thirlmere.
It is a choice of plea- 
sures ; and he will ascend Helvellyn hereafter, if he 
does not now.
Of the two lake roads, the rude western 
one is unquestionably the finest.
The woods, which 
were once so thick that the squirrel is said to have gone 
from Wythburn to Keswick without touching the 
ground, are cleared away now ; and the only gloom in 
the scene is from the mass of Helvellyn.
The stranger 
leaves the mail road within a mile of the Nag's Head, 
passes the cottages called by the boastful name of the 
City of Wythburn, and a few farm-houses, and soon 
emerging from the fences, finds himself on a grassy 
level under the Armboth Fells, within an amphitheatre 
of rocks, with the lake before him, and Helvellyn be- 
yond, overshadowing it.
The rocks behind are feathered 
with wood, except where a bold crag here, and a free 
cataract there introduces a variety.
There is a clear 
pool in the midst of the grass, where, if the approaching 
tread be light, the heron may be seen fishing, or faith- 
fully reflected in the mirror.
The track leads by the 
margin of the lake, and through a shady lane, and a 
farm yard, to the bridge by which the lake is to be 
crossed.
The water is shallow there, between two pro- 
montories ; so that piers are easily built, with little 
wooden bridges at intervals : and thus is solved what is 
to novices a great mystery ; — how there can be a bridge 
over a lake.
There is another mystery just behind, 
under the Armboth Fells, — a haunted house.
Lights 
are seen there at night, the people say ; and the bells 
ring ; and just as the bells all set off ringing, a large 
e2

JOHjS".
dog is seen swimming across the lake.
The plates and 
dishes clatter ; and the table is spread by unseen hands.
That is the preparation for the ghostly wedding feast 
of a murdered bride, who comes up from her watery 
bed in the lake to keep her terrible nuptials.
There is 
really something remarkable, and like witchery, about 
the house.
On a bright moonlight night, the spectator 
who looks towards it from a distance of two or three 
miles, sees the light reflected from its windows into the 
lake ; and, when a slight fog gives a reddish hue to the 
light, the whole might easily be taken for an illumina- 
tion of a great mansion.
And this mansion seems to 
vanish as you approach, — being no mansion, but a 
small house tying in a nook, and overshadowed by a hill.
The bridge being crossed, another bit of lane leads out 
upon the high road near the clean little inn, the King's 
Head, and within view of the vale of St. John.
One would like to know how often the Bridal of 
Triermain has been read within that vale.
The Castle 
Rock, in its disenchanted condition, is a prominent 
object in approaching the vale from Legberthwaite, or 
by the road just described ; and there are lights and 
gloomy moments in which it looks as like as may be to 
a scene of witchery, — now engrossing the sunshine 
when the range to which it belongs is all in shadow ; 
and now perversely gloomy, because there is a single 
cloud in the sky .
The narrow vale is full of character 
and charm, from end to end ; and at its northern extre- 
mity it comes out upon a spot of strong historical 
interest.
The village of Threlkeld will, by its name, re- 
mind the traveller of the good Lord Clifford, the story of 
CASTLERIGG.
71 
whose boyhood is familiar to all readers of Wordsworth.
That place is, indeed, the refuge where the boy passed 
his shepherd life ; and there is a local tradition that, 
though he never learned to read or write, during the 
twenty-four years that he spent in keeping sheep, his 
astronomical knowledge was considerable, and so inter- 
esting to him that he improved it by study after he 
came to his estates.
The road through Threlkeld will, 
however, be followed by the traveller on another occa- 
sion, and not now : for he must not miss that view from 
Castlerigg, which made the poet Gray long to go back 
again to Keswick ; and he will not, therefore, now pass 
through the vale.
Within five miles from the peep 
into it, the view opens, which presently comprehends 
the whole extent from Bassenthwaite Lake to the 
entrance of Borrowdale, — the plain between the two 
lakes of Bassenthwaite and Derwent Water, presenting 
one of the richest scenes in England, — with the town 
of Keswick, and many a hamlet and farmstead besides ; 
and the two churches, — the long, white, old-fashioned 
Crosthwaite church, in which Southey is buried, and the 
new red-stone church of St. John, with its spire, and 
the school houses and pretty parsonage at hand.
These 
were built by the late John Marshall, of Hallsteads, — 
a name which is more spoiled than dignified by any 
conventional addition.
The church and parsonage were 
occupied by the husband of one of his daughters ; and 
now heand his son-in-law lie buried there together.
Skiddaw is here the monarch of the scene.

stretches out to the lake of that name ; and at the 
southern end the Borrowdale mountains are grouped 
with wonderful effect, — Castle Crag occupying the most 
conspicuous place.
On the eastern side, to the left of 
the spectator, Wallabarrow Crag rears its crest, and 
unfolds its woods below ; while the opposite side of the 
lake is guarded by Cat Bells and other mountains, bare 
and pointed, and possessing a character of their own.
A steep winding road descends into the valley ; and at 
the foot of the hill lies Keswick.
There is no beauty in the primitive little town itself ; 
but it has its attractions, besides the convenience of its 
central situation among so many mountains and valleys.
Of these attractions, the first is, undoubtedly, Mr. Flin- 
toft's Model of the Lake District, which is within a few 
yards of all the principal inns, and may be seen during 
a shower, when, otherwise, the stranger might be losing 
temper in hearing the rain drip.
That model, — at 
first sight an uneven ugly bit of plaster, — will beguile 
a sensible traveller of a longer time than he would sup- 
pose possible.
Ten minutes would give him a better 
idea of the structure and distribution of the country 
than all maps and guide books ; but he will probably 
linger over it till he has learned all the sixteen large 
lakes, and some of the fifty-two small ones, and traced 
every road and main pass in the district.
Crosthwaite's 
Museum is also a place of great interest, for its own 
sake, as well as that of its founder, — Peter Crosthwaite, 
the first real explorer, surveyor and draughtsman of the 
district, and the inventor of the seolian harp, the life- 
boat (the reward of which invention he missed through 
KESWICK.

carelessness in a government office,) and various other 
matters, useful or curious.
The museum contains 
ancient coins, ancient books, and a good geological and 
mineralogical collection.
It was begun between 70 and 
80 years ago ; and the founder died in 1808.
It is pre- 
served, improved and exhibited by his descendants.
The inns of Keswick are numerous.
The chief are 
the Eoyal Oak, the Queen's Head, and the King's 
Arms, — all good.
EXCURSIONS FROM KESWICK.
DEEWENT WATEE.
The first object of attention will be the lake itself; 
and it will probably be viewed by boat.
The uppermost 
thought at all points about the foot of the lake is of the 
Derwentwater family.
They had once a castle on the 
hill called Castlehead, where they built upon the site of 
a Druidical circle.
This hill should be visited for the 
view.
The Batcliffes also possessed Lord's Island, the 
largest on the lake, where their mansion is said to have 
been built, from the stones of the old one on Castle- 
head.
Kamps Holme, another of the islands, was 
their' s also ; and the hermit, the dear friend of St.
Cuthbert, who lived in St. Herbert's Isle in the seventh 
century, is somehow mixed up in legends, in local 
imaginations which are careless of dates, with the same 
family.
All that is known of St. Herbert is, that he 
really had a hermitage in that island, and that St.
Cuthbert and he used to meet, either at Lindisfarn or 
Derwentwater, once a-year.
The legend about their 
deaths is well known ; that, according to their prayer, 
they died on the same day.
There is beauty in the 
tradition that the man of action and the man of me- 
ditation, the propagandist and the recluse, were so 
dear to each other, and so congenial.

Derwent Isle, is the other of the four larger islands.
Lord's Isle was once a part of the mainland.
The 
Ratcliffes cut a fosse, in the feudal times, and set up a 
drawbridge.
When the young Lord Derwentwater 
was captured for being " out " in 1715, his lady 
escaped, and saved her liberty and the family jewels 
(to use them on behalf of her husband) by clambering 
up one of the clefts of Wallabarrow Crag, since called 
the Lady's Rake.
Every where are there traces of the 
unhappy family ; even in the sky, where the aurora 
borealis is sometimes called, to this day, Lord Derwent- 
water' s lights, because it was particularly brilliant the 
night after his execution.
The lake is about three miles long, and, at its broad- 
est part, about a mile and a half wide.
Its waters are 
singularly clear, and its surface often unruffled as a 
mirror.
Then it reflects the surrounding shores with 
marvellous beauty of effect, — from the bare crest of 
the crag and peak of the mountain to the grassy knoll 
and overhanging birch.
Pike, trout, and perch abound 
in the lake ; but not char, which requires deeper water.
The Floating Island, whose appearance is announced in 
the newspapers at intervals of a few years, has obtained 
more celebrity than it deserves.
It is a mass of soil 
and decayed vegetation, which rises when distended 
with gases, and sinks again when it has parted with 
them at the surface.
Such is the explanation given by 
philosophers of this piece of natural magic, which has 
excited so much sensation during successive generations .
Sometimes it comes up a mere patch, and sometimes

If the tourist desires, (as it is to be hoped that 
he does) to see one of the primitive valleys of the dis- 
trict, — one of those recesses lapped in the mountains, 
where the sounds of civilised life have hardly penetrated, 
let him now go to Watendlath (locally called Wathen- 
dal) and descend into Borrowdale by Eosthwaite.
The 
circuit is one of 13 miles ; and it must be accomplished 
on foot or horseback ; for there is no carriage-road in 
the upper part.
So few pass that way that the women 
afford a remarkable specimen of the effects of a life of 
excessive seclusion.
The men go to markets and sales, 
and have more use of their tongues and wits accordingly.
The road along the lake side is followed, till it gives 
out a branch before reaching Barrow House.
Up this 
by-road the explorer goes, and passes behind and above 
Barrow House, soon reaching the stream that feeds the 
Barrow fall, which may be visited by strangers in the 
grounds below.
The upland valley runs parallel with 
the lower one ; and in it lies the clear circular pool 
which feeds the fall of Lodore.
Stout pedestrians say 
WATENDLATH.

that the walk over the trackless heather, turning to the 
left, over the fells to Thirlmere, is glorious in a fine 
autumn day.
No doubt it is : but our business now 
is to follow the track before us.
It takes us to the 
little foot-bridge between the tarn and the verge of the 
crag ; and the peep down the chasm shows the lake and 
the Skidclaw range in beautiful union.
Helvellyn rises 
to the east, and Scawfell and Bowfell show themselves in 
front, all the way down into Borrowdale.
The descent 
upon Rosthwaite is the concluding treat.
The way is 
easy, — a gentle slope over grass and elastic heather ; 
and the whole surface is starred over with bright heath 
flowers.
The head of the dale, imposing under all 
aspects, opens out, and seems to be spreading its green 
levels for the stranger's rest.
The passes to Langdale 
by the Stake, to Wastdale by Sty Head, and to Butter- 
mere by Honister Crag, disclose themselves round the 
projecting Glaramara.
The other way lie Grange and 
the Lake ; and beneath lies Eosthwaite, with the brat- 
tling stream behind, which must be crossed by stepping- 
stones to reach the little inn.
Before turning his face 
lakewards, the traveller must go forward a few yards 
from Simpson's inn, to where he will see a narrow 
entrance and steps in the right-hand fence.
He must 
go in there, and mount that little hill, called Castlehill, 
whence the truest and best total view of Borrowdale is 
obtained ; for the station is nearly central.
He is now standing in the middle of that far-famed 
Borrowdale, of which so many curious tales are told.
Its inhabitants were once considered as primitive as we 
now consider those of Watendlath ; and a good deal 
78 ANCIENT WISDOM.
more, if the current stories are true.
It is said that an 
old Borrowdale man was once sent a very long way for 
something very new, by some innovator who had found 
his way into the dale.
The man was to go with horse 
and sacks (for there were no carts, because there was 
no road) to bring some lime from beyond Keswick.
On 
his return, when he was near Grange, it began to rain ; 
and the man was alarmed at seeing his sacks begin to 
smoke.
He got a hatful of water from the river ; but 
the smoke grew worse.
Assured at length that the 
devil must be in any fire which was aggravated by 
water, he tossed the whole load over into the river.
That 
must have been before the dalesmen built their curious 
wall ; for they must have had lime for that.
Spring 
being very charming in Borrowdale, and the sound of the 
cuckoo gladsome, the people determined to build a wall 
to keep in the cuckoo, and make the spring last for ever.
So they built a wall across the entrance, at Grange.
The plan did not answer ; but that was, according to 
the popular belief from generation to generation, because 
the wall was not built one course higher.
It is 
simply for want of a top course in that wall that 
eternal spring does not reign in Borrowdale.
Another 
anecdote shows, however, that a bright wit did occasion- 
ally show himself among them.
A " statesman" — (an 
" estatesman," or small proprietor) — went one day to a 
distant fair or sale, and brought home what neither he 
nor his neighbours had ever seen before ; — a pair of 
stirrups.
Home he came jogging, with his feet in his 
stirrups ; but, by the time he reached his own door, he 
had jammed his feet in so fast that they would not come

out.
There was great alarm and lamentation ; but, as 
it could not be helped now, the good man patiently sat 
his horse in the pasture for a day or two, his family 
bringing him food, till the eldest son, vexed to see the 
horse suffering by exposure, proposed to bring both into 
the stable.
This was done ; and there sat the farmer 
for several days, — his food being brought to him, as 
before.
At length, it struck the second son that it was 
a pity not to make his father useful, and release the 
horse ; so he proposed to carry him, on the saddle, into 
the house.
By immense exertion it was done ; the 
horse being taken alongside the midden in the yard, to 
ease the fall : and the good man found himself under his 
own roof again, — spinning wool in a corner of the 
kitchen.
There the mounted man sat spinning, through 
the cleverness of his second son, till the lucky hour 
arrived of his youngest son's return, — he being a 
scholar, — a learned student from St. Bees.
After duly 
considering the case, he gave his counsel.
He suggested 
that the goodman should draw his feet out of his shoes.
This was done, amidst the blessings of the family ; and 
the goodman was restored to his occupations and to 
liberty.
The wife was so delighted that she said if she 
had a score of children, she would make them all 
scholars, — if only she had to begin life again.
It is by no means to be supposed, however, that there 
was no wit in the valley, but what had come from 
St. Bees.
On the contrary, a native genius, on one 
occasion, came to a conclusion so striking that it is 
doubtful whether any university could rival it.
A 
stranger came riding into the dale on a mule, and, being 
80 THE BOWDER STONE.
bound for the mountains, went up the pass on foot, 
leaving the animal in the care of his host.
The host 
had never seen such a creature before, nor had his 
neighbours.
Fearing mischief, they consulted the wise 
man of the dale ; for they kept a Sagum, or medicine 
man, to supply their deficiencies.
He came, and after 
an examination of the mule, drew a circle round it, and 
consulted his books while his charms were burning ; 
and, at length, announced that he had found it.
The 
creature must be, he concluded, a peacock.
So Borrow- 
dale could then boast, without a rival, of a visit from a 
stranger who came riding on a peacock.
There is a 
real and strong feeling in the district about these old 
stories.
Only last year, when a Borrowdale man entered 
a country inn, a prior guest said simply "cuckoo," and 
was instantly knocked down ; and a passionate light 
ensued.
This cannot last much longer, — judging by 
the number of new houses, — abodes of gentry, — built 
or building in Borrowdale.
The wrath must presently 
turn to a laugh in the humblest chimney corner in the 
dale.
Eosthwaite is beautifully situated near the centre of 
the dale, and at the confluence of the two mountain 
brooks which form the Derwent.
This river flows 
through the lakes of Derwent Water and Bas sen th wait e, 
passes Cockermouth, and falls into the sea at Working- 
ton.
Following its course, the traveller reaches the 
Bowder Stone at a mile from Eosthwaite, — a fallen 
rock, standing on its point, and about thirty feet high, 
and sixty long.
There are steps for ascent to the top ; 
but it is as well seen from below, where it cannot but 
GRANGE.

catch the eye of the passenger.
A mile further lies 
Grange, at the entrance of the dale, with its undulating 
bridges crossing the windings of the river.
When the 
Abbots of Furness owned the whole of Borrowdale, a 
few monks were placed at its entrance, to receive and 
guard the crops ; and this place was their granary.
It is now a picturesque hamlet, which must be familiar 
to all who haunt exhibitions of pictures.
Nobody 
who carries a pencil can help sitting down on the 
grass to sketch it.
Just behind it, the noble wooded 
rock, which leaves room only for the road and the 
river, is Castle Crag ; and nimble youths who have 
reached its summit, say the view is splendid.
It is, 
in itself, a fine spectacle.
After this, the traveller begins to listen for the fall 
of Lodore, and he finds the inn at the distance of a 
mile from Grange.
It is a delighful little inn, clean 
and well managed, and, by its situation, preferable to 
those at Keswick, except for the convenience of head- 
quarters.
To visit the fall, the way is through the gay 
little garden, and the orchard, (where the fish-preserves 
are terrible temptations to waste of time) and over a 
foot bridge, and up into the wood, where the path leads 
to the front of the mighty chasm.
It is the chasm, 
with its mass of boulders and its magnificent flanking 
towers of rock, that makes the impressiveness of the 
Lodore fall, more than the water.
No supply short of 
a full river or capacious lake could correct the dispro- 
portion between the channel and the flood.
After the 
most copious rains, the spectacle is of a multitude of 
little falls, and nowhere of a sheet or bold shoot of 
82 LODOKE.
water.
The noise is prodigious, as the readers of 
Southey's description are aware : and the accessaries 
are magnificent.
Growder Crag on the left, and 
Shepherd's Crag on the right, shine in the sun or frown 
in gloom like no other rocks about any of the falls of 
the district ; and vegetation nourishes every where, 
from the pendulous shrubs in the fissures, 200 feet 
overhead, to the wild flowers underfoot in the wood.
On a lustrous summer evening, when the lights are 
radiant, and the shadows sharp and deep, the scene is 
incomparable, whatever may be the state of the water.
When the stream is fullest, and the wind is favourable, 
it is said the fall is heard a distance of four miles.
There is something else to be heard here ; and that is 
the Borrowdale echoes.
A cannon is planted in the 
meadow before the inn, which awakens an uproar from 
the surrounding crags to Grlaramara.
The road from Lodore to Keswick, about three miles, 
runs between the lake and the Wallabarrow and Falcon 
Crags.
It is a charming walk in all seasons, — sheltered 
in winter, shady, for the most part, in summer ; and in 
spring and autumn presenting a vast variety of foliage, 
bursting forth or fading.

The tour which embraces the country between the 
four lakes, Derwent Water, Buttermere, Crummock 
Water, and Bassenthwaite, is one of twenty-six miles ; 
and it should be allowed to occupy the greater part of 
a day, — time being taken both for survey and refresh- 
ment.
Its outset will afford a good opportunity for 
visiting Greta Hall, Southey's abode, and his monument 
in Crosthwaite Church ; — a recumbent statue by 
Lough, — the inscription being written by Wordsworth.
The villages along the road, beginning with Portinscale, 
will exhibit their own evidence of the employment of 
the inhabitants in the woollen manufacture ; an ancient 
staple of the town and district, as is shown by the 
inscription which has come down from the olden time, 
engraved on a flagstone.
" May God Almighty grant His aid 
To Keswick and its woollen trade." 
84 YALE OF NEWLANDS.
Afterwards, the views over the rich plain, and glimpses 
into fertile valleys are charming, till the road winds in 
among what the oldest guide-books truly call the solemn 
pastoral scenes that open after leaving Keskadale.
The 
houses of Keskadale are the last seen before entering 
on the ascent of Newlands Haws.
The vale formed by 
the rapid slope of mountains that are bare of trees, 
boggy in parts, and elsewhere showing marks of winter 
slides, is wholly unlike any thing else in the district.
Its silence, except for the bleating of sheep ; its ancient 
folds, down in the hollow, the length and steepness of 
the ascent, and the gloom of the mountain, — Great 
Robinson, with its tumbling white cataract, — render 
this truly "a solemn pastoral scene." At the head of the 
vale, it is found not to be shut in.
A turn to the right 
discloses a new landscape.
A descent between green 
slopes of the same character leads down directly upon 
Buttermere.
The opposite side of the hollow is formed 
by the mountain Whitelees.
The stream at the bottom 
flows into Crummock Water ; and the four peaks of 
High Crag, Hayrick, High Stile, and Red Pike, are 
ranged in front.
The Lake of Buttermere and Honister Crag must be 
left for another day.
To-day, the turn is to the right, 
and not the left.
The traveller may proceed along 
Crummock Water either by boat or in his carriage.
Or he may leave the horse to bait at Buttermere while 
he takes a boat to see Scale Force, and returns.
The meadow between the two lakes is not more than 
a mile in extent.
The walk to the boat lies through 
its small patches of pasture and wooded knolls ; and a 
CKTIMMOCK WATER.
85 
pretty walk it is.
The path is prolonged to Scale Force 
over the fields ; but it is usually too swampy to be 
agreeable, when a boat can be had.
A short row brings 
the stranger to the mouth of the stream from the 
force ; and he has then to walk a mile among stones, 
and over grass, and past an old fold.
The chasm 
between two walls of rock, which are feathered with 
bright waving shrubs, affords a fall of 160 feet, — 
high enough to convert the waters into spray before 
they reach the ground.
It is one of the loftiest water- 
falls in the country ; and some think it the most elegant.
There is a point of view not far off which the traveller 
should visit.
His boat will take him to the little pro- 
montory below Melbreak, called Ling Crag.
From 
200 yards, or rather more, above this, he will see two 
lakes and their guardian mountains to the greatest 
advantage.
The drive along Crummock Water is one of the 
most charming we know ; especially where the road 
forms a terrace, overhanging the clear waters, and 
sweeping round Rannersdale Knot.
Melbreak fills up 
the opposite shore, with its isolated bulk ; and Bed 
Pike discloses its crater ; both being streaked with red 
and lead-coloured screes, and tracts of bright verdure 
and darker moss.
On the side where the road is, 
Whitelees, Grassmoor, and Whiteside rear their swelling 
masses ; and the road winds pleasantly among fields 
and meadows, till it passes behind the Lanthwaite 
Woods, and turns down, in full view of the rich Yale 
of Lorton, to Scale Hill Inn. That best and most 
home-like of inns should be the traveller's resting

place for days together, if he desires a central point 
whence he may visit a great extent of the lake coun- 
try, while in command of a variety of pleasures near 
at hand.
From Scale Hill he can descend into the 
vale of Lorton, and enjoy a change from the rugged- 
ness of the dales.
Or, he may visit the most solemn 
and imposing of the lakes, — Wast Water ; and also 
Ennerdale.
He commands all the roads to Keswick, 
and the vales that lie between.
Crummock Water 
yields char, as well as every other lake fish, in abun- 
dance.
The mountain tops are accessible : from 
Lowfell, which may be a lady's morning walk, to 
Eed Pike, which is a pretty good day's scramble for 
a stout student.
There is Lowes Water at one end of 
Crummock, and Buttermere at the other : and at home 
there is a spacious, clean, airy house, standing in a 
garden ; good fare, careful attendance, and reasonable 
charges.
Scale Hill is a place to spend a month in, in 
a fine season.
A few minutes will take" the stranger up to the 
Station, by a path from the inn door.
The Station is 
a hill in Lanthwaite Wood, whence a magnificent view 
is obtained of the stern mountain group, (the central 
group of the whole district,) on the one hand, and the 
rich levels of Lorton Vale on the other, backed, in 
favourable lights, by the Scotch mountains.
This 
spot is one on which to linger through a long summer 
day, pacing the sward, and choosing seats from rock 
to rock, along the whole crest.
The stranger must 
now, however, take his brief survey, and hope to come 
again.
He has twelve miles to go to Keswick; and 
YALE OF LORTOK.
87 
the early part of it is steep and slow.
The turn is to 
the right, at about a mile from Scale Hill, leaving the 
Cockermouth road, which traverses the vale of Lorton.
The higher he ascends, the more lovely are the views 
over that vale that the traveller obtains, till at length 
the Solway gleams in the sun, and the Scotch moun- 
tains appear beyond.
If he has good eyes, the driver 
will point out to him, at a vast distance, the famous 
old Lorton yew, appearing like a dark clump, beside a 
white farmhouse.
When fairly under Whinlatter, six 
or seven miles from Scale Hill, he cannot but ad- 
mire, — in one or the other sense of the word, — the 
colouring of the hill itself, if the time be anywhere 
from June to September.
The gaudy hues of the 
mingled gorse and heather are, at that season, unlike 
any exhibition of colour we have seen elsewhere, — ex- 
ceeding even the far-famed American forest.
As the 
north-western vision vanishes, the south-eastern opens ; 
and the vale of Keswick, with Skiddaw in its noblest 
aspect, and the lakes far below, looks finer than ever.
After passing through Braithwaite, he soon recognises 
the road, and returns to Keswick by the well-known 
bridge over the Derwent.

5 Keswick 18 
Bassenthwaite is perhaps the last of the lakes to be 
visited, unless it be Hawes Water.
Hawes Water is 
difficult of access to the ordinary tourist : and Bassen- 
thwaite verges towards the flat country, which is not 
what the traveller came to visit.
It is amusing to 
observe how the residents in the district become more 
sensible every year to the beauty of the merely undu- 
lating country through which the mountains sink into 
the plains : while strangers have hardly patience to look 
at it, in their eagerness to find themselves under the 
shadow of the great central fells.
Bassenthwaite is one 
of the outermost lakes ; and it is therefore no more 
cared for by the tourists in general than the foot of 
Coniston or Windermere.
Still, considering that Skid- 
daw overshadows its eastern shore, it would seem worthy 
of some attention ; and the drive of eighteen miles 
round it is, in truth, a very pleasant one.
This lake is larger than Derwent Water, being four 
miles in length and one mile in breadth.
The distance 
BASSENTHWAITE.
89 
from lake to lake is between three and four miles, a 
large proportion of which is apt to be flooded in winter ; 
and occasionally the waters actually join, so as to 
present the appearance of a lake of ten miles long, — 
the length of Windermere.
These floods are a serious 
drawback to the productiveness of the lake levels, and 
the health and comfort of the inhabitants.
The side opposite Skiddaw is the most interesting of 
the two; so the traveller takes it first.
The road 
passes through Portinscale and Braithwaite to Thorn- 
thwaite, and leaves Whinlatter on the left.
It passes 
through woods and pretty glades which make a charming 
foreground, while old Skiddaw fills the view on the 
opposite shore.
Lord's Seat and Barf rise boldly to 
the left, and the road runs, for the most part, on the 
margin of the lake.
It winds round, after passing 
Peel Wyke, to Ouse Bridge, beneath which the lake 
discharges itself in the form of the much enlarged river 
Derwent, which flows away towards Cockermouth.
If 
it is thought worth while to go a mile or two out of 
the way for an exceedingly fine view, the traveller will 
follow the Hesket road for a mile beyond Castle Inn, 
and ascend the Haws on the right.
Thence he will 
see a charming landscape, — the open vales of Embleton 
and Isell, and the whole expanse of the lake, with its 
rich terraced shores.
From Castle Inn, it is eight miles 
to Keswick.
The road turns away from the lake, and 
presents nothing more of remarkable beauty.
FOURTH TOUR.
ASCENT OF SKIDDAW.
The ascent of Skiddaw is easy, even for ladies, who 
have only to sit their ponies to find themselves at the 
top, after a ride of six miles.
There must be a guide, 
— be the day ever so clear, and the path ever so plain.
Once for all let us say, in all earnestness, and with the 
most deliberate decision, that no kind of tourist should 
ever cross the higher passes, or ascend the mountains, 
without a guide.
Surely, lives enough have been lost, 
and there has been suffering and danger enough, short 
of a fatal issue, to teach this lesson.
But the confident 
and joyous pedestrian is not the most teachable of 
human beings.
In his heart he despises the caution of 
native residents, and in his sleeve he laughs at it.
The 
mountain is right before him; the track is visible 
enough ; he has a map and guide book, and boasts of 
his pocket-compass.
With the track on his map, and 
track on the mountain, both before his eyes, how should 
he get wrong ?
So he throws on his knapsack, seizes 
his stick, and goes off whistling or singing, — the host 
and hostess looking after him and consulting as he 
strides away.
For some time he thinks he can defy all 
the misleading powers of heaven and earth.
But, once 
out of reach of human help, he finds his case not quite 
so easy as he thought.
Instead of one path, as marked 
GUIDES.
91 
on his map, he finds three ; and perhaps the one he 
relies on may have disappeared under recent accidents, 
or have lapsed into swamp.
He finds himself on the 
edge of a precipice, and does not know how far to go 
hack.
He finds the hog deepen, and thinks he can 
scarcely he in the right road.
He finds a landslip, 
which compels him to make a wider circuit, and mean- 
time it is growing dusk.
Worst of all, a fog may come 
on at any moment ; and there is an end of all security 
to one who does not know the little wayside-marks 
which guide the shepherd in such a case.
Tales are 
current throughout the region of the deaths of natives, 
even in the summer months, through fog, wet, fatigue, 
or fall, — the native having a hetter chance than a 
stranger, ten times over.
And why should the risk be 
run ?
It cannot be to save the fee, in the case of a 
journey of pleasure.
The guide is worth more than his 
pay for the information he has to give, — to say nothing 
of the comfort of his carrying the knapsack, — as many 
knapsacks as there are walkers.
If solitude be desired, 
the meditative gentleman will soon find that anxiety 
about the way, and an internal conflict with apprehen- 
siveness are sad spoilers of the pleasures of solitude.
Better have a real substantial, comfortable, supporting 
shepherd by his side, giving his mind liberty for con- 
templation and enjoyment of the scene, than the 
spectres of the mountain perplexing him on all sides, 
and marring his ease.
But enough.

know what mountain climbing is, among loose stones, 
shaking bog, and slippery rushes or grass, with the 
alternative of a hot sun or a strong wind, and perpetual

liability to mist, will not dispute the benefit of having 
a guide : and novices ought to defer to their judgment.
If we have seemed to dwell long on this point, it is 
because warning is grievously wanted.
It will probably 
not be taken by those who need it most ; but it ought 
to be offered.
Even in the mild ascent of green Skiddaw, then, 
there is a guide.
— At the distance of half-a-mile from 
Keswick, on the Penrith road, just through the toll- 
bar, a bridge crosses the Greta.
The road, after cross- 
ing this bridge, winds round Latrigg, and in the direc- 
tion of Low Man, crossing the barren plain called 
Skiddaw Forest.
The plain of Keswick, and the lake 
and its islands, grow smaller and smaller, and the 
surrounding mountains seem to swell and rise, as the 
road gently climbs the side of Skiddaw; and, when 
about half way up, that lower world disappears, while 
a more distant one comes into view.
The Irish Sea 
and the Isle of Man rise, and the Scotch mountains 
show themselves marshalled on the horizon.
At the 
first summit, after a mile of craggy ascent, steeper 
than the rest, the city of Carlisle comes into view, 
with the coast and its little towns, round to St. Bees, 
with the rich plains that lie between.
But there is a 
higher point to be reached, after an ascent of 500 feet 
more ; and here Derwentwater comes into view again.
And how much besides !
Few lakes are seen ; but the 
sea of mountain tops is glorious ; and the surrounding 
plains ; and the ocean beyond ; and land again beyond 
that.

Castle and the hills of Kirkcudbright, Wigton and

like a mountain, I am sure, in my life!" "Bleak" 
the air is indeed "atop," — exposed as the summit is 
to the seawinds.
If the stranger desires to take a 
leisurely view, he must trouble his guide or his pony 
with a railway wrapper, or something of the sort, to 
enable him to stand his ground.
The descent may be 
made, for the sake of variety, by a road through 
Milbeck and the pretty village of Applethwaite ; or by 
descending the north side of the mountain, and coming 
out upon the road, just north of the village of Bassen-

antiquity stands in a field, near the entrance of St.
John's Yale.
The stones, forty-eight in number, form 
an oval ; and there is a peculiarity in this case which 
distinguishes it from all other Druidical monuments 
extant in England.
On the eastern side, within the 
circle, there is a small recess formed by ten stones, 
making an oblong square.
As Southey observed, the 
spot is the most commanding that could be chosen, 
short of a mountain side ; and it is indeed nearly sur- 
rounded by mountains, which it recognises in their true 
forms, from the levels, — with the exception of the plain 
towards Penrith, — being sunk out of view.
The old 
legend about the last human sacrifice of the Druids 
may belong to any of the monuments of that age in 
the district ; and it is probably claimed for them all.
According to that old story ; when some people settled 
in a clearing of the woods, beside a river, somewhere to 
the south of the district, the priests took up their 
station further north, among the mountains, where 
there were plenty of stones fit and ready for their 
temple.
After a time, a fever laid waste the lower

settlement; and the oracle demanded a sacrifice to 
appease the divine wrath.
The lot fell on a young girl 
who was betrothed : and, on an appointed day, she was 
conveyed, with all the ceremonies, to the temple.
A 
small hut of wickerwork, like a large beehive, was found 
set up on the western side of the temple.
The girl was 
led into the circle, and placed in the midst, while the 
dedication proceeded.
We are even told that she was 
adorned with an oak garland, and held mistletoe in her 
hand.
The whole population was looking on from a 
distance: but it must have been within reasonable 
reach, as every one was required to contribute a stick to 
the fire.
The wretched lover saw all from afar ; and 
he daringly resolved, — let the god be as wrathful as he 
pleased, — not to contribute so much as a twig to the 
burning of his beloved.
She was seen to enter the 
door, which was next the circle ; and then the priest 
closed it up, and heaped the dried leaves and sticks that 
were brought all round the hut.
The arch-druid mean- 
time was procuring fire from two pieces of wood.
He 
succeeded, and set the pile in a blaze.
In this moment 
of desperation, the lover saw every mountain round 
give forth a great cataract ; and all the floods gushed 
to the temple as to a centre, and made an island of the 
little hut, — returning when they had extinguished the 
fire.
The victim came forth, with not a hair singed, 
and not a leaf of her garland withered.
The arch- 
druid, skilled to interpret thunder, seems to have under- 
stood in this case the voice of waters ; for he announced 
that, henceforth, the god would have no more human 
sacrifices.
Any resident who is sufficiently familar with 
96 DEUIDICAL CIKCLES.
the country people to get them to speak their minds 
fully, will find that they still hold to the notion that 
nobody can count the druid stones correctly ; and also 
that a treasure is buried under the largest stone.
As 
to the first, — there are, in most such circles, some 
smaller stones cropping out of the ground which some 
visitors will, and others will not, include among those 
of the circle.
We ourselves counted Long Meg and 
her daughters, near Penrith, many times before making 
out the prescribed sixty-seven, with any certainty.
As 
for the treasure, can any one prove that it is not there ?
Nobody wants to undermine the stone, to get rid of the 
tradition : so our neighbours are like the Arabs at 
Petra, who have been shooting with sling, bow, and 
matchlock, for a thousand years, at the urn, where they 
are sure Pharaoh's treasure is, — in its niche in the rock 
temple.
For a thousand years, they have failed to 
bring it down, and are determined that no European 
shall.
And no European would dismantle the temple 
to disabuse the Arabs ; and so the tradition and the urn 
stand untouched.
So may it be for ages to come with 
Long Meg, and the giant of eight tons' weight that 
presides over the Keswick circle !
The ascent of Saddleback may begin behind Threl- 
keld, up a path which the villagers will point out : but 
an easier way is, to diverge from the main road some 
way further on, by the road to Hesket, near the village 
of Scales.
The hill-side path is to be taken which leads 
along Souter Fell, by the side of the stream which 
descends from Scales tarn.
This part is the very home 
of superstition and romance.
This Souter, or Soutra 
SOUTEE FELL GHOSTS.
97 
Fell, is the mountain on which ghosts appeared in 
myriads, at intervals during ten years of the last 
century, — presenting precisely the same appearances 
to twenty-six chosen witnesses, and to all the inhabi- 
tants of all the cottages within view of the mountain ; 
and for a space of two hours and a-half at one time — 
the spectral show being then closed by darkness.
The 
mountain is full of precipices which defy all marching 
of bodies of men ; and the north and west sides present 
a sheer perpendicular of 900 feet.
On Midsummer 
eve, 1735, a farm-servant of Mr. Lancaster's, half-a-mile 
from the mountain, saw the eastern side of the summit 
covered with troops, which pursued their onward march 
for an hour.
They came, in distinct bodies, from an 
eminence in the north end, and disappeared in a niche 
in the summit.
When the poor fellow told this tale, 
he was insulted on all hands ; as original observers 
usually are when they see anything wonderful.
Two 
years after, also on a Midsummer eve, Mr. Lancaster saw 
some men there, apparently following their horses, as if 
they had returned from hunting.
He thought nothing 
of this ; but he happened to look up again ten minutes 
after, and saw the figures now mounted, and followed 
by an interminable array of troops, five abreast, march- 
ing from the eminence and over the cleft, as before.
All the family saw this, and the manoeuvres of the 
force, as each company was kept in order by a mounted 
officer who galloped this way and that.
As the shades 
of twilight came on, the discipline appeared to relax, 
and the troops intermingled, and rode at unequal paces, 
till all was lost in darkness.
Now, of course, all the 
98 SOIITEK TELL GHOSTS.
Lancasters were insulted, as their servant had been: 
but their justification was not long delayed.
On the 
Midsummer eve of the fearful 1745, twenty-six persons, 
expressly summoned by the family, saw all that had 
been seen before, and more.
Carriages were now inter- 
spersed with the troops ; and every body knew that no 
carriages ever had been, or could be, on the summit of 
Souter Fell.
The multitude was beyond imagination ; 
for the troops filled a space of half-a-mile, and marched 
quickly till night hid them, — still marching.
There 
was nothing vaporous or indistinct about the appearance 
of these spectres.
So real did they seem that some of 
the people went up, the next morning, to look for the 
hoof-marks of the horses ; and awful it was to them to 
find not one foot-print on heather or grass.
The 
witnesses attested the whole story on oath before a 
magistrate ; and fearful were the expectations held by 
the whole country-side about the coming events of the 
Scotch rebellion.
It now came out that two other 
persons had seen something of the sort in the interval, 
viz., in 1743, — but had concealed it to escape the 
insults to which their neighbours were subjected.
Mr.
Wren, of Wilton Hall, and his farm-servant, saw, one 
summer evening, a man and a dog on the mountain, 
pursuing some horses along a place so steep that a horse 
could hardly, by any possibility, keep a footing on it.
Their speed was prodigious, and their disappearance at 
the south end of the fell so rapid, that Mr. Wren and 
the servant went up, the next morning, to find the 
body of the man who must have been killed.
Of man, 
horse, or dog, they found not a trace : and they came 
scales tar:*.
99 
down, and held their tongues.
When they did speak, 
they fared not much the better for having twenty-six 
sworn comrades in their disgrace.
As for the explana- 
tion, — the Editor of the Lonsdale Magazine declared 
(Yol. ii.
p. 313.) that it was discovered that on that 
Midsummer eve of 1745, the rebels were " exercising 
on the western coast of Scotland, whose movements 
had been reflected by some transparent vapour, simi- 
lar to the Fata Morgana." This is not much in 
the way of explanation : but it is, as far as we know, 
all that can be had at present.
The facts, however, 
brought out a good many more ; as the spectral march 
of the same kind seen in Leicestershire in 1707 : and 
the tradition of the tramp of armies over Helvellyn, 
on the eve of the battle of Marston Moor.
And now 
the tourist may proceed, — looking for ghosts, if he 
pleases, on Souter Fell.
Here, too, lies another wonder, — that tarn (Scales 
Tarn) which is said to reflect the stars at noonday, — 
a marvel which we by no means undertake to avouch.
The tarn is so situated at the foot of a vast precipice, 
and so buried among crags, that the sun never reaches 
it, except through a crevice in early morning.
This 
dark water is one of the attractions which bring 
strangers to this mountain ; though the easy ascent of 
Skiddaw better suits the greater number.
Another 
attraction here is the deeper solitude of the recesses 
of old Blencathra, — as Saddleback should still be 
called.
Another is the view of Derwent Water from 
the summit.
Southey says, " Derwent Water, as seen 
from the top of Saddleback, is one of the finest moun- 
100 ASCEKT.
tain scenes in the country." That summit is called 
Linthwaite Fell ; and there the guide will point out, 
better than we can do, the various objects, — seas, 
islands, castles in their woods, and cities of the plain ; 
mountains, far and near ; shores, like the boundaries of an 
estate, and lakes like its fish-ponds.
People who made 
the ascent sixty years since have left a terrifying ac- 
count of its dangers, such as now excites a smile among 
energetic tourists.
One gentleman was so "astonished," 
near the outlet, "with the different appearance of 
objects in the valley beneath," that he chose to stay 
behind.
Another of the four presently "wished to lose 
blood and return:" but he was coaxed onwards to the 
tarn, where, however, he could see no stars, though it 
was noonday.
Mr. Green, with his companion Mr.
Otley, was among the earlier adventurers who stood on 
the highest ridge.
He was so accurate an observer 
that his descriptions of unfrequented and unalterable 
places will never be antiquated.
" From Linthwaite 
Pike," he says, " on soft green turf, we descended 
steeply, first southward, and then in an easterly direc- 
tion to the Tarn ; a beautiful circular piece of trans- 
parent water, with a well-defined shore.
Here we 
found ourselves engulphed in a basin of steeps, having 
Tarn Crag on the north, the rocks falling from Sharp 
Edge on the east, and on the west, the soft turf on 
which we had made our downward progress.
These 
side-grounds, in pleasant grassy banks, verge to the 
stream issuing from the lake, whence there is a charming 
opening to the town of Penrith ; and Cross Fell seen 
in extreme distance.
Wishing to vary our line in 
SHARP EDGE.
101 
returning to the place we had left, we crossed the 
stream, and commenced a steep ascent at the foot of 
Sharp Edge.
We had not gone far before we were 
aware that our journey would be attended with perils : 
the passage gradually grew narrower, and the declivity 
on each hand awfully precipitous.
From walking erect, 
we were reduced to the necessity either of bestriding the 
ridge, or of moving on one of its sides, with our hands 
lying over the top, as a security against tumbling 
into the tarn on the left, or into a frightful gully on 
the right, — both of immense depth.
Sometimes we 
thought it prudent to return ; but that seemed un- 
manly, and we proceeded; thinking with Shakspere 
that ' dangers retreat when boldly they're confronted.' 
Mr. Otley was the leader, who, on gaining steady 
footing, looked back on the writer, whom he perceived 
viewing at leisure from his saddle the remainder of his 
upward course." On better ground they had a retros- 
pect on Sharp Edge, — which is the narrowest ridge 
on Saddleback, or any other north-of-England moun- 
tain.
In places, its top is composed of loose stones 
and earth ; and, the stepping on the sides being as 
faithless as the top, the Sharp Edge expedition has less 
of safety in it than singularity.
And now, — those who, after this, like to go there, 
know what they have to expect.
The other mountain-lake, lying north-east of this, 
and called Bowscale Tarn, is also reputed to reflect the 
stars at noonday, but under so many conditions, that 
it will be a wonder if any body ever has the luck to see 
them.
It is in this tarn that, in the belief of the

country people, there are two fish which cannot 
die ; — the same fish that used to wait on the pleasure 
of the good Lord Clifford when, in his shepherd days, 
he learned mathematics from the stars upon the moun- 
tain.
The traveller can return either by the way he 
came ; or by Knott Crag, down upon Threlkeld ; or by 
following the course of the Grlenderaterra, along the 
skirts of Saddleback and Skiddaw, — coming out upon 
the Keswick road about a mile from Threlkeld.
This 
last mode of descent is considered by far the most 
interesting.
Whenever he passes that bit of road to Keswick, he 
will be more and more struck with the advantages of 
the situation of the mansion on Greta Bank, with its 
airy position, its walks through the woods, with the 
Greta dashing below ; and afar, the uninterrupted view 
of the whole of Derwentwater basin and surrounding 
mountains.
The tenth commandment is, we imagine, 
oftener broken there than in most places.

There is a circuit by which the chief objects of the 
Lake District can be seen in four days, even by ladies 
and elderly persons.
We will describe this route, 
interpolating some directions for stout pedestrians 
who can undertake more than the majority of tourists.
The starting-point of this tour may be either Kes- 
wick or Ambleside, according as the traveller enters 
the district from the north or the south.
Supposing 
it to be Keswick, the first day's journey is by Matter- 
dale to Ullswater, and by the Kirkstone Pass to 
Ambleside.
g3 
104 MATTERDALE.
The distance from Keswick to Patterdale is nine- 
teen miles ; and from Patterdale to Ambleside ten 
more ; so that the journey should begin in good time, 
if the scenery is to be duly enjoyed.
The first part of 
the road, as far as Threlkeld, has been abundantly 
described.
It then becomes wild and bleak, while 
commanding noble distant views of the Keswick 
mountains, and of the saddle-shaped aspect of Old 
Blencathra.
Mell Fell, the ugliest of hills, — like a 
tumulus planted all over with larch, grows larger as 
the traveller proceeds, till he finds he is to make a 
sharp turn to the right, and pass directly under it.
Judging from our own experience, we should say that 
this part of the journey is always broiling hot or bit- 
terly cold.
A bleak high-lying tract it certainly is, 
where the old monks no doubt suffered much and often 
in their expeditions.
Their paternosters said among 
the perils of Ulls water, and their Ave Marys here are 
supposed to have given the names of Patterdale and 
Matterdale, which become more interesting as soon as 
their origin is known.
From Matterdale, the road 
drops down upon Gowbarrow Park, already described 
at p.
38.
It is a usual practice to send on the carriage 
to the Patterdale Inn, (weather permitting) where the 
driver will order dinner to be ready in two hours or so : 
and then the traveller will explore the park, and see 
Ara Force, and walk the remaining four miles, — 
enjoying as he goes, the very finest views of Ullswater.
An ordinary party of travellers will be content with 
the road to Ambleside, to close the labours of the day.
But young men will choose, if there be daylight left,

to diverge to the left at Hartsop, to see Hays "Water.
The track passes among the farms, and beside the beck, 
between the mountains, and up till the source is 
reached, — the secluded tarn called Hays Water.
This 
little lake is a mile and a-half from the main road, and 
the ascent is rather steep.
It is the delight of the 
angler, because it is also the delight of the trout.
It 
is overhung by High Street ; so that perhaps the 
Roman eagles, as well as the native birds of the rocks, 
have cast their shadows upon its surface.
Not far off 
lies Angle Tarn, on the southern end of Place Fell.
Both these tarns send their brooks down, to swell the 
stream from Brothers' Water, which is itself supplied 
from the busy, noisy beck that descends the Kirkstone 
Pass ; and the whole, united with a tributary from 
Deepdale, form the clear brown stream which winds 
through Patterdale, and empties itself into Ullswater.
Brothers' Water derives its name from the accident — 
which is said to have happened twice, — of brothers 
being lost in it, in the attempt of one to save the other.
On one of the two occasions, the accident happened 
through the breaking of the ice, when the brothers 
were making a venturesome short cut across it to 
church.
— No persuasion of ours can be necessary to 
induce any traveller to visit Deepdale, if he has time.
Its aspect from the road is most tempting ; — only, it 
cannot, like the walk to Hays Water, be accomplished, 
in the longest summer day, in addition to the route 
given for the day.
An account of Ambleside will be found at p.p. 41, 55.

There are two ways, meeting at Stanley Grhyll, — 
(the grand waterfall of the district,) — which are about 
equally beautiful, though entirely unlike ; but the 
shorter one, by Cockley Beck, is fit only for good 
walkers, in fair weather.
There is no reason why ladies 
should not achieve it, by taking ponies, or a car, which 
they will leave in the steeper parts.
We will suppose, 
in order to describe both, that the party divides, — the 
young men going sixteen miles on foot, by the moun- 
tains to Stanley Grhyll, and meeting there the carriage 
party, who have made a circuit of about ten miles 
longer, and will take up the pedestrians for the remain- 
ing six miles to Strands.
The drive to Coniston has been already described.
THE DTJDDOl*.

The road now to be followed, passes through Coniston 
and Torver, and then diverges from the lake, overlook- 
ing a region in which the hills sink into heathery 
undulations, which again subside into a wide alluvion, 
which stretches to the estuary.
When it is high 
water, the scene is fine : but the vast reaches of sand at 
low water are dreary.
The coast railway is seen 
crossing the estuary, — its cobweb tracery showing 
well against the sand or the water.
Near at hand 
Brought on Tower rises from the woods above the little 
town : but there is nothing else to detain the eye.
Tourists who desire to ascend Blackcombe, should do 
it from hence, — the summit being only six miles from 
Broughton ; and guides are here to be procured.
Wordsworth says of this mountain that " its base 
covers a much greater extent of ground than any 
other mountain in those parts ; and, from its situation, 
the summit commands a more extensive view than 
any other point in Britain." One would think that 
this testimony, and Col. Mudge's information that, 
when residing on Blackcombe for surveying purposes, 
he more than once saw Ireland before sunrise, would 
bring strangers to try their luck in seeing Scotland, 
Staffordshire, and Ireland, from the same point : but 
the mountain lies out of the ordinary track of tourists, 
and very few visit it.
The next portion of the drive is charming ; — up the 
valley of the Duddon.
The series of sonnets that 
Wordsworth has given us may have led strangers to 
expect too much : but to an unprepossessed eye the 
valley must appear lovely.
Leaving the Bootle road 
108 ttlpha kibe:.
and the bridge to the left, the road ascends so steeply 
that the travellers will get out and walk ; and many a 
time will they turn to the sea- view, and the wooded 
slopes on the way to Bootle, and the rocks, dressed 
with wild flowers, that enclose the road.
Then comes 
a common covered with fern, in which the greenest of 
paths form a net-work : and far below dashes the brown 
river, between rocky banks ; and Duddon Grove, with 
its conservatories and beautiful grounds and green 
clearings, is seen in the hollow of the vale.
Four miles 
from Broughton, the bridge at Ulpha Kirk spans the 
river, and discloses a beautiful view, up and down, One 
thing which the traveller is always expected to remark 
is the strange holes (called pots) worn by the waters in 
the rocks, and the rounding of the edges of the boul- 
ders and shelves in the channel.
Ulpha Kirk is a mere 
hamlet ; but there is a little inn at which the horses 
can rest if the party are disposed for a walk to the 
scene of Robert Walker's life and labours.
Ulpha Kirk 
itself is one of the primitive places where the old man- 
ners of the district may yet be traced more clearly than 
in most road-side settlements.
The people still think it 
no sin to do their farm work on Sundays, when the 
weather, — so precarious here, — is favourable ; and the 
familiar style of " the priest" in these parts makes the 
transition from work to worship very natural.
Some 
time since there was a blind "priest" settled there.
One Sunday morning, the bell rang before the people 
were all ready; and especially the stoutest farmer in 
the neighbourhood, who, detained by some cow, pig, or 
sheep, entered the church last of all, " thunnerin' down 
ROBERT WALKER'S CHURCH.
109 
the aisle." "Wha's comin' now?" asked the blind 
priest ; and, being informed by the clerk that it was 
John T , he inquired further, " a-foot or a-horse- 
back ?
" Odd sprinklings of learning are found in these 
by-places, as in Scotland.
Some students staying at 
this same little inn, and wanting to settle their account, 
wrote a note in Latin to the landlord, asking for the 
bill, and sent it by the girl who waited.
Mr. Gunson, 
the landlord, (from whom the present landlord is 
descended) immediately sent in the bill in Greek.
It 
was too much for the students, who where obliged to 
ask to have it in English.
There was a " heigh lamed" 
woman, not far from hence, who married a farmer on 
the moor.
When every body was lamenting the hard 
times, she declared that, for her part, she should be 
contented if she could obtain food and raiment ; where- 
upon her husband rebuked her presumption.
" Thoo 
fule," said he : " thoo dusn't think thoo'st to hev 
mare than other folk.
J'se content wi' meeat and 
claes." 
Newfield Church, in Seathwaite, is the place where 
Robert Walker, called " the Wonderful," exercised his 
office for sixty years.
The grey farmsteads stand 
under their sycamores, dispersed in the vale, and up 
the slope which meets the Walna Scar track from 
Coniston.
Rocky and wooded knolls diversify the 
dale ; and the full beck runs down to join the Duddon, 
for which it is often mistaken : but the Duddon is 
unseen here, so deep lies its channel among the rocks.
The church is little loftier or larger than the houses 
near.
But for the bell, the traveller would hardly 
110 THE PABSONAGE.
have noticed it for a church on approaching : but when 
he has reached it, there is the porch, and the little 
graveyard, with a few tombs, and the spreading yew, 
encircled by the seat of stones and turf, where the 
early comers sit and rest till the bell calls them in.
A little dial, on a whitened post in the middle of the 
enclosure, tells the time to the neighbours who have 
no clocks.
Just outside the wall is a white cottage, so 
humble that the stranger thinks it cannot be the par- 
sonage: yet the climbing roses and glittering ever- 
greens, and clear lattices, and pure uncracked walls, 
look as if it might be.
He walks slowly past the 
porch, and sees some one who tells him that it is 
indeed Kobert Walker's dwelling, and courteously in- 
vites him in to see the scene of those life-long chari- 
ties.
Here it was that the distant parishioners were 
fed on Sundays with broth, for which the whole week's 
supply of meat was freely bestowed.
Hither it was 
that in winter he sent the benumbed children, in com- 
panies, from the school in the church, to warm them- 
selves at the single household fire, while he sat by the 
altar all the school hours, keeping warmth in him by 
the exercise of the spinning wheel.
But the story is 
too well known, as it stands in Wordsworth's works, 
to need further celebration here : too well known, we 
should think, not to induce tourists to walk two miles 
from Ulpha Kirk and back again, to visit the homes, 
in life and in death, of Robert Walker.
There are 
changes even here.
There is a school-house, warmer 
in winter than the church : and there is a decline in 
the number of attendants at church.
The Wesleyan 
BIRKER MOOR.
Ill 
chapel at Ulpha has drawn away some ; and the taste 
for Sunday diversion, which has found its way over 
the hills from Coniston, estranges more ; and the 
descendant and successor of the good pastor says 
that "the old stocks are gone, and the new families 
are different." Thus is the large world's experience 
reflected in this little vale !
The finest part of the Duddon scenery is just here ; 
and it is a charming walk by the stepping-stones, 
celebrated by Wordsworth, and up and over the moor, 
to descend upon Eskdale.
The travelling party sees 
nearly the same view, as far as the mountain is con- 
cerned, by crossing at Ulpha Kirk, and getting upon 
the moor that way.
As soon as the enclosures are 
past, up springs the lark, and freely run the rills, and 
keen is the air ; and ghostlike are the mountains that 
appear by degrees above the high foreground of the 
moor.
It is a rare pleasure in the lake district to 
meet with the lark.
It is only on a very wide expanse 
of moorland that it can happen ; for in the valleys the 
birds of prey allow no songsters.
The eagles are gone 
(or nearly), and few ravens are left among the crags : 
but there are hawks domineering in every vale ; so 
that those who would hear the lark must go out to 
such places as Birker Moor.
— The mountain group in 
front is that which has been remarked upon before as 
the centre of the region ; — the lofty nucleus whence 
the vales diverge (as Wordsworth observed after 
Green) "like the spokes of a wheel." Scawfell is 
the highest; and the whole line, from that peak to 
Hardknot, is very fine in all lights.
The dark basin

key may be had at the farmhouse of Dalegarth ; and 
there perhaps, or in the glen, the party from Fellfoot 
may be found to have arrived first.
The Stanley Grhyll fall has much the character of 
Ara Force ; and the immediate surroundings may per- 
haps be rivalled by other waterfalls in the district.
But the glen itself is indisputably the finest in the 
region ; and it is scarcely possible to say too much of 
the view from the Moss-house on the steep, which 
should certainly be the first point of view.
From 
hence the eye commands the whole ravine, whose sides 
are feathered with wood from base to ridge.
The fall 
is between two crags, — the one bare, the other crowned 
with pines ; and if there is a slant of sunlight between 
them, it gives the last finish of beauty to the chasm.
The most modern element in the scene, the young 
larches, cannot offend the eye, — so well as their vivid 
green is intermingled with the well-grown beech, oak, 
birch, and hollies, of a soberer hue.
There is a bridge 
below, descried from the moss-house, which will tempt 
the stranger to find his way down ; and there he will 
meet with two more, by means of which he will reach 
the fall.
Here, among a wilderness of ferns and wild 
flowers, he may sit in the cool, damp abyss, watching 
the fall of waters into their clear rock-basin, till his ear 
is satisfied with their dash and flow, and his eye with

the everlasting quiver of the ash sprays, and swaying 
of the young birches which hang over from the ledges 
of the precipice.
A path then leads him under the 
rocks, now on this side of the stream, and now on that, 
till he emerges from the ravine, and winds his way 
through the hazel copse to the gate.
It may be thought that our travellers have not 
leisure for much of this meditating in the glen : and it 
is true that by this time, the sun is sloping westwards ; 
but there are only six miles to be travelled ; and there 
are no more rough mountain tracks to-day, but a good 
road, — (wonderfully red) across Eskdale, and all the 
way to Strands.
After crossing the Esk, and passing the little inn at 
Bout, the road runs above the river, till, at the King 
of Prussia Inn, it turns up out of Eskdale, and crosses 
into Miterdale.
Before Eskdale is lost sight of, the 
opening of the valley to the sea affords a fine view, 
with the little town of Eavenglass seated in the bay 
where the Irt, the Mite, and the Esk flow into the sea.
Then comes a long ascent, and more views of the levels 
towards the coast, — rich with woods and fields, bounded 
by sands and sea.
Then there is a descent, to cross the 
Mite ; and another ascent ; and a descent again to 
pretty Santon Bridge, on the winding Irt. Instead of 
passing the bridge, however, the road to the right must 
be taken, which leads, in two miles, to Strands.
There 
is again a long ascent : but even the tired traveller will 
not complain of it, when the circle of mountains round 
Wast Water opens before him.
The lake is not 
visible ; but there is no mistaking where it lies.
To 
114 STRANDS.
the right, and close at hand, the Screes present their 
remarkable sweep of debris, and crests streaked with 
red, grey, and vivid green, and here and there cloven 
for the passage of cataracts from the brow, which 
tumble down through the gloom of woods.
Hawlghyll 
is the largest of these ravines.
Next, the Scawfell peaks 
rise above the rest ; and Great End just peeps over the 
shoulder of Lingmell.
The cleft between Lingmell 
and Great Gable is Sty Head Pass ; and to the left, 
from Great Gable, are Yewbarrow and Middlefell.
The broken foreground on the common whence this 
view is seen adds greatly to its beauty.
Descending 
upon Wastdale, the Irt is crossed ; and then the road 
meets others on the green.
The one to the right leads 
to the lake.
Sweeping round to the left, and passing 
the church, — so small and domestic-looking as to 
appear like a house, — the road reaches the two little 
inns.
They are humble but clean ; and horses can be 
had, and boats for the lake.
Now we must see how the party by Fellfoot has 
fared.
Their route has been described, as far as Skelwith 
Bridge ; — viz : the road by Clappersgate, and the 
Brathay valley, in which, however, they must keep the 
right-hand road.
Passing Skelwith Bridge, they had 
better, if on foot, go through the gap in the wall 
mentioned in p.
47, and follow the path in the wood 
which will lead them out into the road at the top of 
the hill.
After about a mile from thence, they must 
take the road to the right, which turns sharp down the 
very steep hill to Colwith Bridge.
Colwith Force, a 
THE SHIEE STORES.

little further on, will make itself heard and seen.
It 
tumbles from a height of seventy feet, and the adjuncts 
are beautiful.
One mile further along the winding road 
or lane, Langdale Tarn comes into view, with Wetherlam 
swelling up grandly to the south of it.
About a mile 
further on, there is a gate from which the road parts ; 
— the straight forward one leading on to Blea Tarn 
and Langdale ; and the left hand one, which our travel- 
lers must follow, leading to Fellfoot, and the old road 
from Kendal to Whitehaven, which was the only route 
before carriers' carts found their way into the region.
Fellfoot was the house of entertainment whence the 
pack-horse cavalcade began the ascent, or where they 
stopped to congratulate themselves on having accom- 
plished the descent.
The ascent of Wry nose from this 
point is long and rather steep : but the views behind 
become grander with every step.
The travellers are 
now in Westmorland; but at the three shire stones 
at the top, where three counties meet, they will step 
into Lancashire, in order to leave it for Cumberland at 
Cockley Beck bridge, within three miles further on.
We are glad to hear that a spirited citizen of Amble- 
side, to whom his neighbours are under great obli- 
gations, is erecting a stone pillar at the spot where the 
shire stones are, that the junction of counties may not 
be overlooked (as it easily may be now) by the unob- 
servant traveller.
Young tourists, who happen to have 
long limbs, may enjoy the privilege of being in three 
counties at once, by setting their feet on two of the 
three stones, and resting their hands on the third.
The 
stream which is now on the right, divides Lancashire 
H 
116 COCKLEY BECK.
from Cumberland; and Westmorland is left behind.
We know nothing wilder in the district than the 
next two miles.
These are the desolate hills in which 
the Duddon and the Esk take their rise ; and Cockley 
Beck is the spot where the Duddon must he left, to 
cross over to the Esk. There is a farmhouse near 
the bridge, where horses can be refreshed, when a car 
comes this way, while travellers sit down by the stream 
to dinner.
A melancholy and harassed traveller once 
came this way, whose adventure is still talked over in 
Eskdale and Borrowdale.
A party of tourists, among 
whom were two sisters, were on the heights, intending 
to cross Esk Hause into Borrowdale, and to spend the 
night at Seathwaite, — the first settlement there.
Now there is, as we have seen, another Seathwaite on 
the Duddon ; and mistakes frequently arise between 
them.
On Esk Hause, one of the ladies lost sight of her 
party behind some of the rocks scattered among the 
tarns there, and took a turn to the right instead of the 
left.
A shepherd of whom she inquired her way to 
Seathwaite, pointed down to the Duddon valley; and 
that way she went till she found herself at Coekley 
Beck, when the old shepherd farmer who lived there 
was getting his supper in the dusk of the autumn 
evening.
He used his best courtesy to induce her to 
stay till daylight : but she was bent on going at once, 
— so great would be her sister's terror.
As she would 
not be persuaded, the old man went with her, putting 
his crust into his pocket.
It was dark, and the lady 
was weary ; and she was not aware what she was under- 
taking.
After a long struggle, she fainted.
The old 
ESKDALE.
117 
man was afraid to leave her, lest he should not find her 
again : but he succeeded in reaching the water without 
losing sight of her white dress.
He dipped his crust, 
and brought water in his hat to bathe her face.
She 
revived, ate the crust, and strove onwards, — persevering 
on her weary way till between one and two in the 
morning, when she met her sister and a party coming 
from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, with a dozen lanterns, 
to search for her.
She gave her guide " a one-pound 
note  ;" (it was so long ago as that) and afterwards, sent 
him two more.
The whole family connexion of that 
lady will remember for ever that there is a Seathwaite 
on each side Esk Hause.
From Cockley Beck, the road climbs the side of 
Hardknot, and from the highest point commands a 
view of the sea.
The descent into Eskdale is charming, 
— the ravine to the left, in which the infant river 
flows down, being beautifully wooded, and the whole 
valley, with its few hamlets and many sheep, lying 
open, as far as the sea.
In three miles from Cockley 
Beck, the bridge over the Esk is passed ; and Stanley 
Ghyll is less than three miles further.
Scawfell, and 
all that group of summits are in view to the right, 
during the descent : and to the left, Birker Force is 
seen dashing over the rocks.
Bout comes next, and 
then Dalegarth and Stanley Ghyll, where our travellers 
will join their party, after a walk of sixteen miles from 
Ambleside.

The objection to seeing Wast Water early in the 
morning, is that Scawfell may too probably be covered 
with clouds.
He does not take off his night cap so 
soon as the pleasure-seekers.
On this account, we 
have preferred, when weather was favourable, the Fell- 
foot way to Strands, as leaving time for an evening 
drive to Wast dale Head, — five miles and back again.
The travellers by Broughton must no doubt wait till 
the morning.
Taking a cup of tea and a crust, and 
ordering breakfast for two hours hence, the party may 
start early for the far-famed Wast Water, — the most 
solemn and imposing of all the lakes.
For some way, 
the road is a pretty lane, with frequent gates, till the 
beautiful abode of Crook End, the seat of Stanfield 
Rawson, Esq., is passed.
Hawlghyll and the other 
fissures are probably breathing forth their vapours, 
which keep ascending all the way.
There are the 
Screes, with the grey and still lake, — too deep to be 
ever frozen, lying at the base of their prodigious sweep.
WASTDALE HEAD.
119 
The lake is three and a-half miles long, and has the 
Screes for its south-eastern shore.
The line of this 
singular range is almost unbroken.
The crags are 
hidden, about a-third of the way down, by the slope of 
many-coloured debris which slants right into the lake.
The summer thunderstorm and the winter tempest 
sometimes shiver the loosely-compacted crags above; 
and then, when a mass comes thundering down, and 
splashes into the lake, the whole range feels the shock, 
and slides of stones rush into the water, and clouds of 
dust rise into the air.
We gave in approaching Strands, (p.
78.) the names 
of the mountains as they are now seen.
The road 
winds pleasantly round bays and over promontories, 
and the pyramidal Yewbarrow, Great Gable, which 
closes in the dale, and Lingmell and the Scawfell Pikes 
to the right, all explain themselves.
Several brooks 
and rills are passed, flowing down from the valleys; 
and the stranger exclaims that he should like to 
spend a whole summer here, to explore all the ways 
among the mountains.
Several gentlemen have spent 
weeks together at Bitson's farm-house, at the 
dale head, where there are clean beds, and farm-house 
fare in plenty and perfection.
The opening out of the 
dale head, when the valley has appeared to close in 
round the lake, is as wonderful a spectacle to strangers i 
as any thing they see.
The dale is one of those 
perfect levels, shut in by lake and mountains, which 
give a different impression from any other kind of 
scenery in the world.
The passes themselves are so 
high as to leave no appearance of outlet, except by the 
h 3 
120 SITPEKSTITIOIS'S.
lake ; and of these passes there are but two, — the Sty 
Head and Mosedale paths.
The green and perfect 
level, to which the monntains come down with a sheer 
sweep, is partly divided off into fields ; and a few farm- 
houses are set down among the fields, on the bends of 
the gushing and gurgling stream.
There is a chapel, 
— the humblest of chapels, — with eight pews, and 
three windows in three sides, and a skylight over the 
pulpit.
There is now a school : — a chapel and a school 
and no public house !
The schoolmaster is entertained 
on " whittlegate " terms: that is, he boards at the 
farm-houses in turn.
An old man told us that the 
plan answers.
" He gets them on very well," said he ; 
" and particularly in the spelling.
He thinks that if 
they can spell, they can do all the rest." Such are the 
original conclusions arrived at in Wastdale Head.
It 
struck us that the children were dirtier than even in 
other vales, though the houses are so clean that you 
might eat your dinner off the board or the floor.
But 
the state of children's skin and hair is owing to super- 
stition, in all these dales ; and the schoolmaster is the 
one who should cure the evil.
A young lady who 
kindly undertook to wash and dress the infant of a 
sick woman, but who was not experienced in the 
process, exclaimed at the end " dear !
I forgot it's 
• hands and arms.
I must wash them." The mother 
expressed great horror, and said that "if the child's 
arms were washed before it was six months old,- it 
would be a thief;" and, added she, pathetically, "I 
would not like that." The hair and nails must not be 
cut for a much longer time, for fear of a like result.
KIEKFELL.
121 
The Yorkshire people put the alternative of dirty and 
clean rather strongly in their proverb, " Better hev a 
bairn wi a mucky feace than wash its noase off:" but 
the Cumberland folk view the matter more in a moral 
way, and refuse to have their children baptised into 
thievery.
Kirkfell, which stands backward, between Yewbar- 
row and Great Gable, was very tempting to a tourist 
who explored this neighbourhood some years ago ; and 
he set out to get to Buttermere by Blacksail and Scarf 
Gap. After hours of walking, he struck into the deep 
ravine between Kirkfell and Great Gable ; and when he 
arrived within sight of a lake at night, he was con- 
founded to find it still Wast Water.
He had walked 
completely round the mountain, instead of getting on.
We observed to a comrade that this could not have 
happened if the tourist had carried a pocket-compass.
"And not having a compass," said our friend, "he 
fetched one." Wastdale Head is the place whence the 
ascent of Scawfell should be made : but we must defer 
that ; as it would occupy the energies of a whole day.
The party will now return the way they came ; for 
there is no road, of course, under the Screes, though 
the shepherds venture along a perilous thread of a path 
in the loose debris.
After breakfast, the travellers will address themselves 
to the very different spectacle of Calder Abbey and its 
environs.
After climbing the long hill from Strands, an eager 
look-out will be kept for the Isle of Man: but the 
most probable point for seeing it is at the top of the 
122 CALDER ABBEY.
hill between Gosforth (the reddest of villages) and 
Calder Bridge.
Far off at sea rises the outline of its 
mountains ; and when the wind is east, we have repeat- 
edly seen the shadows filling the hollows of its hills.
From this eminence, the road descends through a 
avenue of beech, ash, and other trees, to Calder Bridge.
Here the travellers will leave the carriage, which will 
meet them within an hour at Captain Irwin's gate, on 
their quitting the Abbey.
They must now step into 
the inn garden at the bridge, and see how beautifully 
the brown waters swirl away under the red bridge and 
its ivied banks, while the waving ferns incessantly 
checker the sunshine.
It is a mile to the Abbey, 
through the churchyard, and along the bank of the 
Calder, where again the most beautiful tricks of light 
are seen, with brown water and its white foam, red 
precipitous banks, and the greenest vegetation, with a 
wood crowning all.
The scene is thoroughly monastic.
There is no sound at noonday besides the gushing 
water, but the woodman's axe and the shock of a falling 
tree, or the whirr of the magpie, or the pipe of the 
thrush : but at night the rooks on their return to roost 
fill the air with their din.
The ruins are presently seen, 
springing sheer from the greenest turf.
Relics from 
the abbey are now placed beside the way; and the 
modern house appears at hand.
The ruins should be 
approached from the front, so that the lofty pointed 
arches may best disclose the long perspective behind of 
grassy lawn and sombre woods.
The Abbey is built of 
red sandstone of the neighbourhood, now sobered down 
by time (it was founded in A.D. 1134.) into the richest 
CALDER ABBEY.
123 
and softest tint that the eye conld desire.
But little 
is known of it beyond its date and the name of its 
founder, Ranulph, son of the first Ranulph de Mes- 
chines, a Norman noble.
The church was small, as the 
scanty remains show ; and the monastery, which now 
looks like a continuation of the same building, could 
not have contained a numerous company.
From the 
fragments of effigies preserved, it appears that some 
eminent persons were buried here ; but who these 
knights and nobles were, there is no record that can 
tell, — carefully as these memorials were wrought to 
secure the immortality of this world.
The eye is first 
fixed by the remains of the tower, from whose roofless 
summit dangles the tufted ivy, and whose base is 
embossed by the small lilac blossoms of the antirrhi- 
rom ; but at last the great charm is found in the aisle 
of clustered pillars.
Almost the whole aisle is standing, 
still connected by the cornice and wall which supported 
the roof.
The honeysuckle and ivy climb till they fall 
over on the other side.
There is a sombre corner 
where the great ash grows over towards the tower, 
making a sort of tent in the recess.
There are niches 
and damp cells in the conventual range.
It is a small 
ruin, but thoroughly beautiful : and when the stranger 
looks and listens, as he stands in the green level 
between woods, he will feel how well the old monks 
knew how to choose their dwelling-places, and what it 
must have been to the earnest and pious among these 
Cistercians to pace their river bank, and to attune their 
thoughts to the unceasing music of the Calder flowing 
by.
In the broad noon it is a fine thing to see the 
124 egremoot.
shadows flung, short and sharp, on the sward, and to 
catch the burnish of the ivy, and woo the shade of the 
avenue : and in the evening, it is charming to see how 
the last glow in the west brings out the projections and 
recesses of the ruins, and how the golden moon hangs 
over the eastern mass of tree tops, ready to take her 
turn in disclosing the beauties of the monastic retreat.
The Abbey is carefully preserved, and liberally laid 
open to strangers by Capt.
Irwin.
It is no fault of his 
that his house, a plain substantial modern dwelling, 
stands too near the ruins.
He did not build it ; so 
there is nothing personal in the natural wish of 
strangers that it stood somewhere else.
At the gate the carriage is waiting, and it takes the 
cross road, almost opposite the gate, up to Cold Fell.
The drive over that fell is commonly called dreary ; and 
it is so in bad weather : but it has its charms.
The 
sea-view is fine, — all flecked with cloud shadows as 
with islands : and the wide down sprinkled with sheep, 
that look as ragged as terriers, after tearing their 
fleeces with the furze and brambles with which the 
swelling slopes are embossed.
In a hollow, at rare 
intervals, stands a farm-house, under the ordinary syca- 
more canopy ; and far away, between the slopes of the 
down below, the soil is cut up into fields, with woods 
hanging above ; and at the mouth of the vale, between 
it and the coast, stands Egremont, a little town of 
1,500 inhabitants or so, and which certainly looks very 
pretty from the uplands ; — and cheerful too, in spite of 
its Eoman name, — (the Mount of Sorrow.) It is 
distinguished by Eoman traditions.
It was at the 
THE DE LACYS.
125 
gateway of Egremont Castle that the horn was hung, 
in crusading days, which was twice blown by the 
gallant Sir Eustace de Lacy.
As the Cumberlanders 
tell, Sir Eustace and his brother Hubert rode forth 
together to the Holy Wars ; and Sir Eustace blew the 
horn, saying to his brother, " If I fall in Palestine, do 
thou return and blow this horn, and take possession ; 
that Egremont may not be without a Lacy for its 
Lord." In Palestine, ambition of this lordship so 
took possession of Hubert, that he hired ruffians to 
drown his brother in the Jordan : and the ruffians 
assured him that the deed was done.
Pie returned 
home, and stole into the castle by night, — not daring 
to sound the horn.
But he soon plucked up spirit, 
and drowned his remorse in revels.
In the midst of a 
banquet, one da}^ the horn was heard, sounding such a 
blast that the echoes came back from the fells, after 
startling the red deer from his covert, and the wild 
boar from his drinking at the tarn.
Hubert knew that 
none but Eustace could or would so sound the horn : 
and he fled by a postern while his brother Eustace 
entered by the gate.
Long after, the wretched Hubert 
came to ask forgiveness from his brother ; and having 
obtained it, retired to a convent, where he practised 
penance until he died.
The ruins of this castle stand 
on an eminence to the west of the town.
Before descending to Ennerdale Bridge, the outline 
of the Scotch mountains may be sometimes seen.
Few travellers see more of this lake than in passing ; 
for, while exceedingly wild, it has not the solemnity of 
Wast Water ; and there is a want of wood, to give it 
126 TOURISTS ASTRAY.
grace and beauty.
The enclosure of the waters by 
bare mountains is, however, very fine.
The neighbour- 
hood is full of stories, of escapes and strange adventures 
of such pedestrian tourists as have explored the moun- 
tains : but carriage travellers look down from the road, 
and pass on.
We have mentioned the young man who spent the 
whole of a previous day in walking round Kirk Fell.
Worse happened, in October, 1852, to two gentlemen 
who went, with a pony, but without a guide, from 
Buttermere to Wastdale Head, by Scarf Gap and 
Elacksail.
In Ennerdale valley, wind and rain met 
them.
They struggled part of the way along Black- 
sail, when they became bewildered, and soon so 
exhausted that they had a narrow escape with their 
lives.
But for a brandy flask, which one of them 
carried, they could not have survived.
The pony seems 
to have sunk as rapidly as the men.
These gentlemen 
have publicly suggested the erection of some conspicu- 
ous landmarks, to show the track ; and they have 
uttered their warning, in corroboration of so many 
others, against crossing mountains without a guide.
One of their chief difficulties was the paths being 
turned into watercourses, and thereby disguised.
It 
was on the same track that the three Kendal young 
ladies, mentioned by Mr. Green in his " Guide " (two 
of whom are still living) -lost their way, from dismis- 
sing their guide too soon, and actually staid all night 
on the mountain, where, if it had not been fine summer 
weather, they would have perished.
They took a guide 
over Scarf Gap, and as far as the junction of the three 
STOEM OlS" THE FELL.
127 
roads from Buttermere, Ennerdale, and Wastdale.
The 
guide left them on the right road, and with full infor- 
mation as to the rest of the way.
They took the 
wrong side of the brook, however, and so got bewildered.
It was only four p.m., when the guide left them : but 
darkness overtook them still wandering.
When they 
came down upon Tyson's house, early in the morning, 
the family could not believe the story of their descent, 
so perilous was the way they had come.
One of the 
ladies had, however, lost a pocket-book ; and they had 
seen a dead sheep : and, somebody immediately going 
up, these incidents were verified ; and the adventure 
of the Kendal ladies remains one of the wonders of the 
dales.
We had once an adventure in this neighbourhood, 
the moral of which is, the comfort and security of 
having a guide.
We wanted to cross Blake Fell to 
Loweswater.
The distance to Scale Hill Inn was only 
six miles ; the time summer ; and the track well marked 
on map and mountain.
If there ever was a case in 
which a guide might be thought unnecessary, it was 
this : but two out of the party were young strangers ; 
and the third would not assume the charge of them.
The heat was excessive that day ; so we lagged behind 
the guide, on the ascent, though he carried knapsack 
and baskets.
He was a quiet-looking elderly mountain- 
eer, who appeared to walk very slowly ; but his progress 
was great, compared with ours, from the uniformity and 
continuity of his pace.
In the worst part of the walk, 
we tried the effect of following close behind him, and 
putting our feet in his tracks ; and we were surprised 
128 STOBM 01* THE TELL.
to find with what ease and rapidity we got on.
At 
first we stopped repeatedly, to sit down and drink from 
the streams that crossed the track, or flowed beside it : 
and during those halts, we observed that the blackness 
which had for some time been appearing in the west, 
now completely shrouded the sea.
Next, we remarked 
that while the wind still blew in our faces, — that is, 
from the north-east, — the mass of western clouds was 
evidently climbing the sky.
The guide quietly observed 
that there would be rain by and by.
Next, when we 
were in the middle of the wide fell, and we saw how 
puzzling the network of swampy paths must be at all 
times, we pointed out to one another how the light 
fleeces of cloud below the black mass swept round in a 
circle, following each other like streams in an eddy.
Soon, the dark mass came driving up at such, a rate 
that it was clear we should not finish our walk in good 
weather.
The dense mist was presently upon us.
On 
looking behind, to watch its rate of advance, we saw a 
few flashes of lightning burst from it.
The thunder 
had for some time been growling afar, almost inces- 
santly.
The moment before the explosion of the storm 
was as like a dream as a waking state can be.
We 
were walking on wild ground, now ascending, now 
descending ; a deep tarn (Floutern Tarn) on our right 
hand, our feet treading on slippery rushes, or still more 
slippery grass : the air was dark, as during an eclipse ; 
and heavy mists drove past from behind, just at the 
level of our heads, and sinking every moment ; while 
before us, and far far below us — down as in a different 
world — lay Buttermere and the neighbouring vales

129 
sleeping in the calmest sunshine.
The contrast was 
singular — of that warm picture, with its yellow lights 
and soft blue shadows, with the turbulence and chill 
and gloom of the station from which we viewed it.
We had but a moment to look at it ; for not only did 
the clouds sink before our eyes, but the wind scudded 
round to the opposite point of the compass, throwing 
one after another of us flat as it passed.
Within a few 
minutes, one of us had six falls, from the force of the 
wind, and the treachery of the ground, — now, in a trice, 
a medley of small streams.
It was impossible to stop 
the guide, for a moment's breath.
In the roar of the 
blast, and crash of the thunder, and pelt of the hail, one 
might as well have spoken to the elements : so it was 
necessary for us all to keep up our pace, that he might 
not stride away from us entirely.
Through stumblings 
and slidings innumerable, we did this, — the lightning 
playing about our faces the while, like a will-o'-the-wisp 
on the face of a bog.
The hail and rain had drenched 
us to the skin in three minutes.
The first hailstones 
reached the skin.
They were driven in at every open- 
ing of our clothes; they cut our necks behind, and 
filled our shoes.
Our hats and bonnets were imme- 
diately soaked through, and every body's hair wringing 
wet.
The thunder seemed to roll on our very skulls.
In this weather we went plunging on for four miles, 
through spungy bogs, turbid streams, whose bridges of 
stones were hidden in the rushing waters ; or by narrow 
pathways, each one of which was converted by the 
storm into an impetuous brook.
When we had 
descended into a region where we could hear ourselves 
speak, we congratulated one another on our prudence 
130 LOWES WATER.
in having engaged a guide.
Without him, how should 
we have known the path from the brook, or have 
guessed where we might ford the streams, when the 
bridges were out of sight ?
Two horses, we afterwards 
heard, were killed on the same fell in that storm : and 
we should never have come down, we were persuaded, 
if we had been left to Wfftider by ourselves.
Lamplugh Cross is three miles from Ennerdale 
Bridge ; and thence the road begins to descend, and 
for the most part continues descending for the remain- 
ing six miles to Scale Hill Inn. On leaving the com- 
mon, from which the Solway and Scotch mountains are 
visible, and turning down through a gate upon Lowes 
Water, the view of the central mountain group is again 
very fine.
Lowes Water is one of the out-lying lakes, 
and its lower end is tame accordingly : but it is only a 
mile long ; and the peaks congregate finely about its 
head.
The circuit of Lowes Water, (seven miles) is a 
charming morning's walk.
There is a prosperous look 
about the homesteads there, and a richness about the 
meadows which smacks of the level country, which, in 
the shape of the Vale of Lorton, is near at hand.
On 
the road between Lowes Water and the inn at Scale 
Hill, the great peaks of the central group are all 
visible, from Grassmoor to Great Gable, and from Scaw- 
fell round to Melbreak ; while the prominent Eanner- 
dale Knot projects into Crummock Lake in front ; and 
Honister Crag peeps over from behind.
As the reader 
knows, the whole group may be studied from Scale 
Hill ; and to the utmost advantage from the Station.

comfort the third day of their circuit.

The road as far as Buttermere has been described 
(p.
84).
But the attention of the traveller has hardly 
been sufficiently called to the stormy character of this 
central district, as shown by the aspect of the moun- 
tains.
No where else are they so scarred with weather 
marks, or so diversified in colouring from new rents 
in the soil.
Long sweeps of orange and grey stones 
descend to Crummock Water ; and above, there are 
large hollows, like craters, filled now with deep blue 
shadows, and now with tumbling white mists, above 
which yellow or purple peaks change their hue with 
every hour of the day, or variation of the sky.
The 
bare, hot-looking debris on the Melbreak side, the 
chasms in the rocks, and the sudden swellings of the 
waters, tell of turbulence in all seasons.
The most 
tremendous waterspout remembered in the region of 
the lakes, descended the ravine between Grassmoor 
and Whiteside, in 1760.
It swept the whole side of 
Grassmoor at midnight, and carried down everything 
that was lying loose all through the vale below, and 
I 
132 GftASSMOOR FLOOD.
over a piece of arable land at the entrance, where it 
actually peeled the whole surface, carrying away the 
soil and the trees, and leaving the rocky substratum 
completely bare.
The soil was many feet deep, and 
the trees fullgrown.
Then it laid down what it 
brought, covering ten acres with the rubbish.
By 
the channel left, it appears that the flood must have 
been five or six yards deep, and a hundred yards wide.
Among other pranks, it rooted up a solid stone cause- 
way, which was supported by an embankment appa- 
rently as strong as the neighbouring hills.
The flood 
not only swept away the whole work, but scooped out 
the entire line for its own channel.
The village of 
Brackenthwaite, which stood directly in its course, was 
saved by being built on a stone platform, — a circum- 
stance unknown to the inhabitants till they now saw 
themselves left safe on a promontory, while the soft 
soil was swept away from beside their very doors, 
leaving a chasm where the flood had been turned aside 
by the resistance of their rock.
The end of the matter 
was, that the flood poured into the Cocker, which rose 
so as to lay the whole south-western plain under water 
for a considerable time.
On leaving Buttermere, and passing the very small 
chapel (which yet is " quite big" compared with the 
former one on the same site) the road up Buttermere 
Haws to Newlands is seen ascending to the left.
The 
Lake of Buttermere is only a mile and a-quarter in 
length, and a little more than half-a-mile in breadth.
The mountains which enclose it have been already 
named (p.

flowing down the steep into the lake is called (as others 
in the district are) Sour milk Ghyll ; and it issues from 
Bleaberry, or Burtness Tarn, on the side of Bed Pike.
The pretty domain near the margin of the lake is 
Hasness (General Benson's.) Then comes Gatesgarth, 
— the farmstead whence the road to Scarf Gap is taken, 
by which, as we have told, London gentlemen and 
Kendal ladies have run into such extreme danger.
From Gatesgarth begins one of the wildest bits of road 
in the district.
It climbs Buttermere Yale, by an 
ascent at first gradual, and latterly extremely steep, 
to the base of Honister Crag.
It is a vast stony 
valley, where sheep and their folds, and a quarry man's 
hut here and there, are the only signs of civilization.
There are no bridges over the stream (the infant 
Cocker), which must be crossed many times ; and 
where there are no stepping-stones, the pedestrian 
must wade.
Every body walks up the last reaches 
of the ascent,   — so steep and stony is the narrow road, 
and so formidable its unfenced state.
The dark, stu- 
pendous, almost perpendicular, Honister Crag frowns 
above ; and as the traveller, already at a considerable 
height, looks up at the quarrymen in the slate quarries 
near the summit, it almost takes his breath away 
to see them hanging like summer spiders quivering 
from the eaves of a house.
These quarrymen are a hardy race, capable of feats 
of strength which are now rarely heard of elsewhere.
No heavily-armed knight, who ever came here to meet 
the Scot (and there were such encounters on this spot 
in the ancient border wars) carried a greater weight, or

134 SLATE QTJAKRYME^.
did more wonders in a day than these fine fellows.
The best slate of Honister Crag is found near the top : 
and there, many hundred feet aloft, may be seen 
(by good eyes) the slate-built hovels of some of the 
quarrymen, while others ascend and descend many 
times between morning and night.
Now the men 
come leaping down with their trucks at a speed which 
appears appalling to strangers.
Formerly, the slate was 
brought down on hurdles, on men's backs : and the 
practice is still continued in some remote quarries, 
where the expense of conveyance by carts would be too 
great, or the roads do not admit of it.
Nearly forty 
years ago there was a man named Joseph Clark at 
Honister, who made seventeen journeys, (including 
seventeen miles of climbing up and scrambling down,) 
in one day, bringing down 10,880 pounds of slate.
In 
ascending he carried the hurdle, weighing eighty 
pounds ; and in descending, he brought each time 640 
pounds of slate.
At another time he carried, in three 
successive journeys, 1,280 pounds each time.
His 
greatest day's work was bringing 11,771 pounds; in 
how many journeys it is not remembered : but in 
fewer than seventeen.
He lived at Stonethwaite, three 
miles from his place of work.
His toils did not appear 
to injure him : and he declared that he suffered only 
from thirst.
It was believed in his day that there was 
scarcely another man in the kingdom capable of sus- 
taining such labour for a course of years.
In some places where the slate is closely compacted, 
and presents endways and perpendicular surface, the 
quarryman sets about his work as if he were going 
DESCENT INTO BORROWDALE.
135 
after eagle's eggs.
His comrades let him down by a 
rope from the precipice ; and he tries for a footing on 
some ledge, where he may drive in wedges.
The diffi- 
culty of this, where much of his strength must be 
employed in keeping his footing, may be conceived : 
and a great length of time must be occupied in loosen- 
ing masses large enough to bear the fall without being 
dashed into useless pieces.
But, generally speaking, 
the methods are improved, and the quarries made 
accessible by tracks admitting of the passage of strong 
carts.
Still, the detaching of the slate, and the loading 
and conducting the carts, are laborious work enough to 
require and train a very athletic order of men.
In 
various parts of the district, the scene is marked by 
mountains of debris, above or within which yawn black 
recesses in the mountain side, where the summer thun- 
ders echo, and the winter storms send down formidable 
slides into the vales below.
At the turn under Honister Crag, the vales behind 
disappear, and Borrowdale begins to open upon the 
eye ; — at first in the form of a triangular bit of green 
level far below among the hills.
By degrees, the over- 
lapping mountains part asunder, and disclose more 
farmsteads and broader levels, till the fences are reached.
Thence, it is a steep and rough descent upon Seatoller, 
by the side of the plunging and roaring stream, and its 
canopy of trees.
Passing through the farm-yard at 
Seatoller, the travellers find themselves in Borrowdale, 
with only two miles more to Rosthwaite, (p.
77.) and 
eight to Keswick, and an excellent road all the way.
Thus have our travellers, in the space of four days, 
i 3 
136 NATURAL EMBELLISHMENT.
seen the greater part of the lakes and mountains.
If 
they have used their eyes and minds, they must have 
observed something of the material, moral, and social 
changes going on perpetually in this once secluded 
corner of the United Kingdom.
As for the material changes,' — those wrought in 
silence by Nature are of the same quiet, gradual, 
inevitable kind that have been going on ever since the 
mountains were upreared.
She disintegrates the rocks, 
and now and then sends down masses thundering along 
the ravines, to bridge over a chasm, or make a new islet 
in a pool.
She sows her seeds in crevices, or on little 
projections, so that the bare face of the precipice 
becomes feathered with the rowan and the birch : and 
thus, ere long, motion is produced by the passing 
winds, in a scene where ail once appeared rigid as a 
mine.
She draws her carpet of verdure gradually up 
the bare slopes, where she has deposited earth to sus- 
tain the vegetation.
She is for ever covering with her 
exquisite mosses and ferns every spot which has been 
left unsightly, till nothing appears that can offend the 
human eye, within a whole circle of hills.
She even 
silently rebukes and repairs the false taste of unedu- 
cated man.
If he makes his dwelling of too glaring a 
white, she tempers it with weatherstains : if he indo- 
lently leaves the stone walls and blue slates unrelieved 
by any neighbouring vegetation, she supplies the need- 
ful screen by bringing out tufts of delicate fern in the 
crevices, and springing coppice on the nearest slopes.
— 
The most significant changes, however, are in the 
disposition of the waters of the region.
The margins

of the lakes never remain the same for half a century 
together.
The streams bring down soft soil inces- 
santly ; and this more effectually alters the currents 
than the slides of stones precipitated from the heights 
by an occasional stornu By this deposit of soil new- 
promontories are formed, and the margin contracts till 
many a reach of waters is converted into land, inviting 
tillage.
The greenest levels of the smaller valleys 
may be seen to have been once lakes : and no one who 
looks down upon Grasmere, for instance, from the hill 
field behind the Hollins, can have any doubt as to 
what was once the extent of the waters.
And, while 
Nature is thus closing up in one direction, she is 
opening in another.
In some low-lying spot a tree 
falls, which acts as a dam when the next rains come.
The detained waters sink, and penetrate, and loosen 
the roots of other trees ; and the moisture which they 
formerly absorbed goes to swell the accumulation till 
the place becomes a swamp.
The drowned vegetation 
decays and sinks, leaving more room, till the place 
becomes a pool, on whose bristling margin the snipe 
arrives to rock on the bulrush, and the heron wades 
in the waterlilies to feed on the fish which come 
there, nobody knows how.
As the waters spread, they 
encounter natural dams, behind which they grow clear 
and deepen, till we have a tarn among the hills, which 
attracts the browsing flock, and tempts the shepherd 
to build his hut near the brink.
Then the wild swans 
see the glittering expanse in their flight, and drop 
down into it ; and the waterfowl make their nests 
among the reeds.
This brings the sportsman ; and a

path is trodden over the hills ; and the spot becomes 
a place of human resort.
While nature is thus work- 
ing transformations in her deeper retreats, the genera- 
tions of men are more obviously busy elsewhere.
They 
build their houses, and plant their orchards on the 
slopes which connect the mountains with the levels of 
the valleys : they encroach upon the swamps below 
them, and plough among the stones on the uplands, — 
here fencing in new grounds, there throwing several 
plots into one : they open slate quarries, and make 
broad roads for the carriage of the produce : they 
cherish the young hollies and ash, whose sprouts feed 
their flocks, thus providing a compensation in the 
future for the past destruction of the woods.
Thus, 
while the general primitive aspect of the region 
remains, and its intensely rural character is little 
impaired, there is perhaps scarcely a valley in the 
district which looks the same from one half-century 
to another.
The changes among the people proceed faster : and 
some of these changes are less agreeable to contem- 
plate, however well aware we ma}^ be that they are to 
issue in good.
Formerly, every household had nearly 
all that it wanted within itself.
The people thought 
so little of wheaten bread that wheat was hardly to be 
bought in the towns.
Within the last few years, an 
old man of eighty-five was fond of talking how, when 
a boy, he wanted to spend his penny on wheaten 
bread ; and he searched through Carlisle from morning 
to evening before he could find a penny roll.
The 
cultivator among the hills divided his field into plots, 
THE STATESMEN.
139 
where lie grew barley, oats, flax, and other produce, to 
meet the needs of his household.
His pigs, fed partly 
on acorns or beech mast, yielded good bacon and 
hams ; and his sheep furnished wool for clothing.
Of 
course he kept cows.
The women spun and wove the 
wool and flax, and the lads made the wooden utensils, 
baskets, fishing tackle, &c.
Whatever else was needed 
was obtained from the pedlars, who came their rounds 
two or three times a-year, dropping in among the 
little farms from over the hills.
The first great 
change was from the opening of carriage roads.
There 
was a temptation then to carry stock and grain to 
fairs and markets.
More grain was grown than the 
household needed, and offered for sale.
In a little 
while the mountain farmers were sure to fail in com- 
petition in the markets with dwellers in agricultural 
districts.
The mountaineer had no agricultural science, 
and little skill ; and the decline of the fortunes of the 
"statesmen," as they are locally called, has been 
regular, and mournful to witness.
They haunt the 
fairs and markets, losing in proportion to the advance 
of improvement elsewhere.
On their first losses, they 
began to mortgage their lands.
After bearing the 
burden of these mortgages till they could bear it no 
longer, their children have sold the lands : and among 
the shopboys, domestic servants, and labourers of the 
towns, we find the names of the former yeomanry of 
the district, who have parted with their lands to 
strangers.
Much misery intervened during the pro- 
cess of transition.
The farmer was tempted to lose 
the remembrance of his losses in drink when he at- 
140 DEAM DRINKINGL 
tended the fairs and markets.
The capacity of the 
dalesmen in this respect, — in the quantity of strong 
liquor that they can carry — is remarkable ; and they 
have only too good a training.
Spirits are introduced 
on all occasions.
At sales, of which there are many, 
every spring and autumn, in the dales, and which are 
attended by all the inhabitants who can go, for miles 
round, — glasses of spirit are handed round among the 
purchasers, all day long.
The settling .
of accounts at 
Candlemas is attended by the same curse, — every 
debtor expecting his creditor to offer him the compli- 
ment of a glass of strong liquor.
On that day, it is 
unpleasant to ladies to be abroad, near settlements 
where the Candlemas payments are making, — so many 
are the drunken people whom they meet.
It is com- 
mon to swallow the strong liquor undiluted, in con- 
siderable quantity.
An old dalesman, welcome in 
Ambleside for his shrewdness, simplicity and origin- 
ality, appeared one day at a house where the gentle- 
man was absent, but the lady at home.
The lady 
asked the visitor to sit down and await her husband's 
return, proposing to offer him some spirit and water 
meantime.
He replied he wonnot be nice about t' first 
part e't' offer, but as tot' watter, it could be gitten at 
ony gate (way) side.
To return to the former condition of the " states- 
man." The domestic manufactures he carried to town 
with him, — the linen and woollen webs woven by his 
wife and daughters, — would not sell, except at a loss, 
in the presence of the Yorkshire and Lancashire 
woollens and cottons made by machinery.
He became

141 
unable to keep his children at home ; and they went 
off to the manufacturing towns, leaving home yet 
more cheerless — with fewer busy hands and cheerful 
faces — less social spirit in the dales — greater cer- 
tainty of continued loss, and more temptation to drink.
Such is the process still going on.
Having reached 
this pass, it is clearly best that it should go on till the 
primitive population, having lost its safety of isolation 
and independence, and kept its ignorance and gross- 
ness, shall have given place to a new set of inhabitants, 
better skilled in agriculture, and in every way more up 
to the times.
It is mournful enough to meet every- 
where the remnants of the old families in a reduced 
and discouraged condition : but if they can no longer 
fill the valleys with grain, and cover the hillsides with 
flocks, it is right that those who can should enter upon 
their lands, and that knowledge, industry and temper- 
ance should find their fair field and due reward.
We have no fear of injury, moral or economical, 
from the great recent change, — the introduction of 
railways.
The morals of rural districts are usually 
such as cannot well be made worse by any change.
Drinking and kindred vices abound wherever, in our 
day, intellectual resources are absent : and nowhere is 
drunkenness a more prevalent and desperate curse than 
in the Lake District.
Any infusion of the intelligence 
and varied interests of the townspeople must, it 
appears, be eminently beneficial : and the order of 
workpeople brought by the railways is of a desirable 
kind.
And, as to the economical effect, — it cannot 
but be good, considering that mental stimulus and 
142 SUPERSTITIONS.
improved education are above every thing wanted.
Under the old seclusion, the material comfort of the 
inhabitants had long been dwindling ; and their best 
chance of recovery is clearly in the widest possible 
intercourse with classes which, parallel in social rank, 
are more intelligent and better informed than them- 
selves.
In the pastoral valleys, the trouble occurs now and 
then that the milk will not churn.
Elsewhere, the 
causes of this are understood, and cow and milk are 
treated accordingly.
Not so here.
The cow is at 
once concluded to be bewitched ; and it is apprehended 
that she will spread the witchery to the whole dairy.
So, instead of any sensible method, the remedy tried is 
depositing in the cowhouse some soil from the nearest 
churchyard.
As it is probable that this fails, time 
is lost in other proceedings.
Stirring with a stick 
from the rowan tree is one of the least trouble- 
some.
If the cows are distempered, it is actually a 
practice in many of the dales to light the " need fire." 
Notice being given throughout the neighbouring 
valleys, that the charm may be sent for if wanted, the 
need fire is produced by rubbing two sticks together.
A great pile of combustible stuff is prepared ; and the 
more smoke it can be made to give the better.
When 
lighted, the neighbours snatch some of the fire to 
hurry home with, and light their respective piles.
The cattle, diseased and sound, are then driven through 
the fire, as some of the Irish, by a remnant of pagan- 
ism, charm their property, and even their children, by 
passing or snatching them through the fire, making 
DALE MANAGEMENT.
143 
strangers ask whether Moloch is acknowledged there 
still.
It is said, in a certain Cumberland dale, that 
when a farmer had driven all his other live property 
through, he proceeded to drive his wife after the cows, 
saying he should then be safe from all distempers.
If 
a cock crows in the night, horror and grief seize on 
the household : — some one is sure to die.
If people 
meet a black ram, they turn their money for luck.
They occupy their minds and waste their time in the 
silliest superstitions which keep true knowledge out.
For the result, look at the productions of the region, 
— the torn and dirty wool, the sapless and scentless 
hay, allowed first to run to seed, and then to lie soak- 
ing and parching for weeks in the field, — the flour, 
the meat, the butter, the cheese, — look at any of these 
products in the more retired vales, and say whether 
intercourse with the world outside will not be a good 
thing for the fortunes of those within.
To take only 
the last, — the cheese.
After coming from the other 
grazing districts, and seeing how scientific a matter the 
management of a dairy has become, and what the best 
cheese is, the dairy management of Cumberland is 
marvellous.
Our readers cannot be expected to believe 
the facts without good testimony : and we may refer 
them to such local publications as the " Lonsdale 
Magazine," where, (in Vol. ii.
p. 13.) we are told that 
the Cumberland cheese is harder than buck-horn : and 
that in some places where the husbandmen wear clogs 
shod with iron, it is no uncommon thing to supply the 
absence of the iron with the crust of a dry cheese.
There is plenty of testimony to cheese striking fire 
144 COUNTRY CHEESE.
like a flint.
A soldier used a cheese paring for a flint ; 
and a blacksmith at Cartmel avered that he struck 
sparks from a cheese while cutting it up with an axe.
A tract of dry heather burned without intermission for 
three weeks, having been kindled by sparks from a 
cheese which had rolled from a cart on the road above, 
and bounded from crag to crag.
These things are like 
the barbarism of two centuries ago.
It is the railroad 
that must mend them.
In a generation or two, the 
dale farms may yield wool that Yorkshire and Lan- 
cashire, and perhaps other countries, may compete for.
The cheese may find a market, and the butter may be 
in request.
And at the same time, the residents may 
find their health improved by the greater wholesome- 
ness of their food ; and, before that, their minds will 
have become stirred and enlarged by intercourse with 
strangers who have, from circumstances, more vivacity 
of faculty and a wider knowledge.
The best, as well 
as the last and greatest change in the Lake District is 
that which is arising from the introduction of the 
railroad.
PART IV.
PASSES.
LAN GD ALE, FKOM BOKKOWDALE, BY THE STAKE PASS.
— PATH 
TO EASED ALE.
— PATH TO ESKHAUSE.
The top of the Stake Pass is five miles and a-half 
from Rosthwaite.
The last house, — Stonethwaite, — 
is left behind at the end of a mile.
The path follows, 
and at length crosses, the stream, which is the infant 
Derwent, — finding its way down from Angle Tarn, 
lying high up in a recess of Bowfell.
The rocky mass 
of Eagle Crag rises on the left ; and further on, the 
curious stone called Black Cap. At the top of the 
Stake, the guide (who may be had from the inn at 
Eosthwaite) will point out the great summits, — the 
Scawfell Pikes, Bowfell, Hanging Knotts and Great 
Grable.
Half a-mile of moorland leads to the descent 
on the Langdale side ; a zigzag path which keeps near 
the stream that dashes down into Langdale.
The 
146 DUNGEON GHYLL.
traveller is under the shadow of Bowfell now, and in 
the very centre of the mountains.
Four miles from 
the top of the Stake will bring him down to Langdale 
Head; and two miles more, to the farmhouse of 
Milbeck.
From that farmhouse, where travellers can make a 
good meal of farmhouse fare, there is one thing to be 
done without doubt ; — to visit Dungeon Grhyll.
As 
for the rest, this house is the point of departure in 
various directions, among three of which the traveller 
must make his choice.
Strangers who arrive untired generally go to the 
Ghyll while their ham and eggs are preparing.
The 
green path on the hill side will be pointed out from 
the farm : and the traveller must take care not to make 
for the waterfall he sees in front.
The path he wants 
tends to the left, till it reaches a fence and gate, when 
it turns sharp to the right ; after which there is no 
possibility of losing the way.
It presently joins the 
stream from the force, which leads up into a deep and 
dark fissure, — " Dungeon" and " Ghyll " both meaning 
a fissure.
There is a well secured ladder, by which 
ladies easily descend to the mouth of the chasm ; and 
when they have caught sight of the fall, they can 
please themselves about scrambling any further.
There 
is the fall in its cleft, tumbling and splashing, while the 
light ash, and all the vegetation besides is everlastingly 
in motion from the stir of the air.
Above, a bridge is 
made, high aloft, by the lodgment of a block in the 
chasm.
The finest season for visiting this force is in a 
summer afternoon.
Then the sun streams in obliquely,

— a narrow, radiant, translucent screen ; itself lighting 
up the gorge, but half concealing the projections and 
' waving ferns behind it.
The way in which it converts 
the spray into sparks and many-coloured gerns can be 
believed only by those who have seen it.
The three ways from Milbeck are first down Lang- 
dale to its junction with the Brathay valley, or by 
High Close to Grasmere : secondly, by Wall End to 
Blea Tarn, and the Fellfoot road: and thirdly, by 
Stickle Tarn, up Harrison Stickle, or over into Ease- 
dale.
We have little to observe about the first, — 
Langdale having been described (p.
48) as seen from 
High Close.
Langdale Chapel is a primitive hamlet, 
where the old character of the district is well pre- 
served.
The little chapel is a good specimen of the 
churches of the vales.
A few years since, the rotten 
old pulpit fell, with the clergyman, Mr. Frazer, in it, 
just after he had begun his sermon from the text 
"Behold, I come quickly." The pulpit fell on an 
elderly dame, who escaped wonderfully.
Mr. Frazer, 
as soon as he found his feet, congratulated her on sur- 
viving such an adventure : but she tartly refused his 
sympathy, saying, " If I'd been kilt, I'd been reet 
sarrat, (rightly served), for you'd threatened ye'd be 
comin doon sune." Near this chapel is the Thrang 
Slatequarry, where the stranger should look in and see 
what a mighty excavation has been caused by the 
demand for this fine slate.
Just beyond the chapel, 
the roads part, — that which ascends to High Close 
climbing the hill to the left.
As for the second road from Milbeck, — the main 
K 
148 TALE OE THE SOLITARY.
inducement is the valley in which Blea Tarn lies, — the 
scene of those books of Wordsworth's Excursion which 
relate to the Solitary.
The very rough road scrambles 
up from Langdale, by Wall End, to the upland vale where 
the single farmhouse is, and the tarn, and the stone, 
"like a ship, with keel upturned," which is lodged in a 
stream near to the tarn.
Some people have un- 
accountably fixed on the Bowder Stone to answer this 
description ; but, besides that the Bowder Stone is far 
away, it rests on its edge, instead of its " keel " being 
"upturned." "The two huge peaks, that from some 
other vale peer into this," are the Langdale Pikes ; 
and very fine is the view of them from this wild and 
somewhat dreary hollow.
Since the Excursion was 
written, large plantations of larch have arisen ; but 
they do not much ameliorate the desolation of the 
place.
The road descends the common to Little 
Langdale Tarn ; whence it is described, in a reverse 
manner, in its course to Colwith Force, Skelwith, and 
Ambleside, at p.
115.
In the third direction lies the way up the Pikes, 
and over into Easedale.
The guide from Milbeck will 
take the traveller up the peat road to Stickle Tarn, — 
famous for its trout, and much beloved by anglers.
Its circular basin, brimming with clear water, lies finely 
under the steep rocks of Pavey Ark. There is nothing 
amidst this mountain scenery more interesting than 
its tarns.
Their very use is one which gratifies one's 
sense of beauty.
Their use is to cause such a distribu- 
tion of the waters as may fertilize without inundating 
the lands below.
After rains, if the waters came down 
LANGDALE PIKES.
149 
all at once, the vales would be flooded, — as we see, 
very inconveniently, by the consequences of improved 
agricultural drainage (p.
17).
The tarns are a secu- 
rity, as far as they go ; and at present the only one.
The lower brooks swell after rain, and pour themselves 
into the rivers, while the mountain brooks aloft are 
busy in the same way, emptying themselves into the 
tarns.
By the time the streams in the valley are sub- 
siding, the upper tarns are full, and begin to overflow ; 
and now the overflow can be received in the valley 
without injury.
As for their aspects, under all lights, 
and in all weathers, they must be studied on the spot, 
for no description can afford any impression of the 
truth to highway tourists.
If the traveller means to ascend Harrison Stickle, 
(the higher of the Langdale Pikes,) it will be from 
this point.
The summit of the Pike is 2,409 feet 
above the level of the sea.
The height is not very 
great ; but the view is interesting, from being unlike 
most others that can be obtained, — extending over 
the level country to the south and south-east, while 
commanded by the loftiest peaks of the district.
— 
Passing the way up the Pike, the moorland path leads 
over into Easedale, and down upon Easedale Tarn, 
which has been noticed at p.
51.
There is a way 
down into Borrowdale also, by crossing Codale Fell, 
and getting into the Stake road.
There are other mountain paths out of Langdale.
There is one into Easedale, easier than that just 
described, and commonly used in good weather.
It 
was by this track that the unfortunate couple, — the 
k2 
150 ESK HATTSE.
Greens, whose story is so well known, — were lost in 
the snow, on their return from a sale in Langdale, to 
their home and six children in Easedale.
There is also a very rough path at Langdale Head 
up B,osset Grhyll, answering on the left to the Stake 
road on the right.
It at once catches the eye ; and 
the invariable question of the stranger is which of the 
two is the Stake.
This track leads by Esk Hause and 
Sprinkling Tarn to the Sty Head Pass.
This is truly 
a glorious mountain walk.
From Esk Hause, there is 
a singular view, composed of three lines of landscape.
One begins with Borrowdale, lying immediately below, 
and extends to Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite, past 
Skiddaw, in full glory, and on over the whole inter- 
vening plain, to the Solway and the Scotch mountains.
This is the north-western view.
— The opposite, or 
south-eastern one, begins with Langdale, and proceeds 
by the opening of the Brathay valley and Windermere, 
till it is closed in by Ingleborough, in Yorkshire.
— 
The third, and intermediate view, is down Eskdale, 
past its verdure and its cataracts, past the sands, past 
lonely Blackcombe, to the broad sea.
When we were 
on Esk Hause, the spectacle of these three lines of 
landscape was remarkable.
Towards Keswick, the at- 
mosphere was thick, just to the degree that gave a 
visionary character to the long perspective.
The 
lake of Derwentwater was hardly distinguishable from 
its shores, so that the wooded islands and the town of 
Keswick lay as if in air, still and unsubstantial.
In the 
direction of Eskdale, all was bright and glittering ; 
while from Langdale and the head of Borrowdale the 
MOUNTAIN CHANGES.
151 
white mists came tumbling out towards us, as if to 
stifle us ; and nothing could be seen, except at inter- 
vals, when a whiff of wind disclosed long sweeps of the 
sides of the valleys, and stretches of the streams and 
fields below.
It is these changes that give a singular 
charm to this mountain district.
The residents of the 
valleys, in their occasional ascents to these heights, 
never see the scene twice alike, — the great landmarks 
themselves being scarcely recognizable but by certain 
incidents of their forms.

STY HEAD PASS, FROM WASTDALE TO BOEEOWDALE.
We have noticed the eastern prong of the fork into 
which Glaramara divides the head of Borrowdale.
We 
now have to notice the western, — the Sty Head Pass.
The Stake Pass descends, as we saw, upon Stone- 
thwaite.
The Sty Head Pass descends upon Sea- 
thwaite, — each of these farms being the last dw elling 
at the head of the dale.
Antiquarians tell us that Borrowdale was anciently 
called Boredale, " having its name probably from the 
wild boars which used, in former times, to haunt the 
woody part of Wastdale Forest ; the hill above it 
being called Sty Head, where the swine were wont to 
feed in the summer, and fall down in autumn into this 
dale, where they fed upon nuts and acorns.
Here are 
large flocks of sheep ; and anciently were mines of lead 
and copper.
Here also, in a very high and perpendi- 
dular rock called Eagle Crag, is every year an eyrie or 
nest of eagles." So says the old history.
# But the 
traveller will find no swine near Sty Head now, sum- 
mer or winter.
No creature comes to drink at the 
tarn, — the little clear rippling lake, where the moun- 
taineer throws himself down to rest on the bank, when 
heated by the ascent from the vales.
He has found

everything sunny and dry, perhaps ; but here he sees, 
by the minute diamond drops resting thick on the 
grass, that a cloud has lately stooped from its course, 
and refreshed the verdure in this retreat.
It looks 
very tempting — this bright sheet of water ; but no 
creature now comes to drink, unless a sheep may have 
strayed far from the flock, and in its terror may yet 
venture to stoop to the water, with many a start and 
interval of listening, till, at the faint sound of the 
distant sheep dog, it bounds away.
The solitude is 
almost equally impressive whether the traveller comes 
up from the one dale or the other ; but perhaps the 
most striking to him who comes from Wastdale, 
because he has rather more lately left the dwellings of 
men.
He ascends from Wastdale Head, by the steep 
path clearly visible from below, up the side of Great 
Grable.
At the top of the pass, the view behind is 
extremely fine, — the dale lying 1,000 feet below, 
while the precipices of Scawfell rise 2,000 feet over 
head.
The rill from Sprinkling Tarn is close by, and 
it leads to this Sty Head Tarn, where the boars used to 
come to drink.
Long after the boars were gone, the 
eagles came hither: and this was one of their last 
haunts.
The eagles which gave their name to the 
crag in Borrowdale, being disturbed, settled themselves 
on a rock at Seathwaite, and at length crossed the 
ridge into Eskdale.
The disturbance was of course 
from the shepherds, who lost so many lambs as to be 
driven desperate against the birds.
There was no 
footing on the crag by which the nest could be 
reached ; so a man was lowered by a rope sixty yards 
154 EAGLES.
down the precipice.
He carried his mountain staff 
with him ; its spiked end being the best weapon 
against the birds.
He did not expect to kill the old 
ones ; but year after year the eggs or the young were 
taken.
If he brought the young away alive he had 
the birds for his pains : if the eggs, every shepherd 
gave five shillings for every egg.
It is said that no 
more than two eggs were ever found at one time.
The nest was made of twigs, and lined with a sort of 
grass from the clefts of the rock.
When the fowler 
failed, and the eaglets were reared, they were led away, 
as soon as strong enough, by the parent birds, — no 
doubt to settle in some other spot ; and the parents 
returned without them.
One of this pair was shot at 
by the master of a sheep dog which had been actually 
carried some distance into the air by it, escaping only 
by its flesh giving way.
The shot took effect, but the 
eagle vanished.
About a week after, it was found 
lying on the grass on the uplands at Seatoller, nearly 
starved.
Its bill had been split by the shot, and the 
tongue was set fast in the cleft : it could not make 
much resistance, and was carried home captive.
But, 
when relieved and restored, it became so violent that 
it was necessarily killed.
Its mate brought a successor 
from a distance, a much smaller bird, and of a different 
species.
They built, however, for fourteen more years 
in Borrowdale, before they flew over to Eskdale.
They were not long left in peace there ; and, when 
the larger bird was at length shot, his mate disap- 
peared entirely.
Such devastation as was caused by 
these birds is not heard of now ; but while there are 
ELACKLEAD MINE.
155 
crags aloft and lambs in the vales, there will be more 
or fewer, nobler or meaner, birds of prey.
We are 
unable to ascertain positively, amidst conflicting testi- 
mony, whether any eagles at all remain in the region.
It appears that one has certainly been seen within ten 
years ; and three gentlemen, two of whom are travelled 
men, and not likely to be mistaken in such a matter, 
declare that, four years ago, they saw one sweep down 
from Scandale Fell into Kirkstone Pass, and rest on a 
crag in the vale, some way above Brothers' Water.
There is, however, a preponderance of disbelief of there 
being now any nest and settlement of eagles among 
the mountains of Westmorland and Cumberland.
The descent upon Stockley bridge is easy ; and the 
bridge itself was, a few years since, a favourite subject 
for sketches.
A more picturesque one we never saw : 
but it has been spoiled in the repairing.
— As he pro- 
ceeds, the traveller will find no " nuts and acorns " in 
this " Boredale," nor any remarkable number of swine.
But he may see the place, — if he looks up the hill- 
side to the left, — whence was drawn the modern pro- 
duct that has in modern times, distinguished the 
dale, — the blacklead of which the Keswick pencils are 
made.
It is understood that the productiveness of the 
mine has much lessened ; and the works are, we believe, 
often suspended; but, while the best ore brings 30s.
per lb., there will be more or less perseverance in seek- 
ing it.
The heaps of rubbish, high up the mountain, 
show the spot.
In the clay slate of the mountain is a 
bed of greenstone rock; and "nests" or "sops" or 
" bellies' ' of black lead are found in the greenstone.
156 BOREOWDALE TEWS.
The plumbago is the finest ever discovered : but there 
is great uncertainty about finding it.
At one time, a 
mass of it was discovered lying along like a mighty 
tree, the thicker part being of the finest quality, and 
the ramifications of a poorer, till, at the extremities, it 
was not worthy even to clean stoves.
At other times 
the searchers have been altogether at fault, for a long 
time together.
There was a time when the value of 
this plumbago was so little known that the shepherds 
used it freely to mark their sheep : and next, the proprie- 
tors were obtaining from thirty to forty shillings a 
pound for the lead of one single " sop" which yielded 
upwards of twenty-eight tons.
Those were the days 
when houses were built at the entrance, where the 
workmen were obliged to change their clothes, under 
inspection, lest they should be tempted to carry away 
any of the precious stuff in their pockets.
Under the mine, (the wad) and a little onward, 
amidst the copsewood, are the dark tops of the Bor- 
rowdale yews to be seen, — the " fraternal four," which, 
as Wordsworth tells us, form "one solemn and capa- 
cious grove." The size attained by the yew in this 
district is astonishing.
One which for many years lay 
prostrate at the other end of Borrowdale, measured 
nine yards in circumference, and contained 1,460 feet of 
wood.
The famous Lorton yew (p.
87.) has about the 
same girth ; and one of these four measures seven 
yards round, at four feet from the ground.
At Seatoller, the roads which part off right and left 
are familiar to the traveller who has accomplished the 
preceding excursions, — the one leading to Rosthwaite 
and the other to Honister Crag.
III.
ASCENT OF SCAWEELL.
The ascent of Scawfell is sometimes made from the 
Sty Head Pass ; sometimes from Lingmell ; and some- 
times from Langdale, whence the path meets that from 
Sty Head on Esk Hause.
From Esk Hause the summit 
of the Pike is visible ; but still, care is necessary not to 
ascend the wrong summit.
There are four summits 
which collectively go under the name of Scawfell ; viz, 
the most southerly, which is called simply Scawfell; 
Scawfell Pike, which is sixty feet higher, and the 
highest mountain in England (3,160 feet :) and the 
lower hills, Lingmell and Great End, — the last being 
the northernmost, and fronting Borrowdale.
The 
Ordnance surveyors set up a staff on a pile of stones on 
the highest peak ; so that there need be no mistake 
henceforth.
The two summits are about three-quarters 
of a-mile apart, in a straight line ; but the great chasm 
between them, called Mickledore, renders a wide circuit 
necessary.
There have been fool-hardy persons who 
have passed Mickledore without losing their lives ; and 
there are strangers, almost every season, who attempt 
the ascent without a guide.
These last usually pay the 
penalty of their rashness in hours of uneasy wandering 
and excessive fatigue.
When they think they see their 
way clearly enough, they are pretty sure to find them- 
selves brought up on the verge of a chasm, and com- 
158 SUMMIT OF SCAWFELL.
pelled to " try round " many times before they succeed.
If darkness comes on, there is nothing to be done but 
to wait for daylight where they are.
Another reason 
for having a guide is that the mountains around are 
not recognisable by their forms, — so great is the 
change caused by their being looked at from above.
By map and compass they may be made out : but the 
summit is usually windy i and much time and trouble 
are saved by the information needed being ready at 
one's elbow.
The summit is bare of every thing that grows, 
except moss.
Not a blade of grass is to be seen : and 
it follows that the herdsman and shepherd never have 
to come here after their charge.
Blocks and inclined 
planes of slate rock, cushioned and draped with mosses, 
compose the peak.
As for what is seen from it, — 
the best service to the stranger is still to copy portions 
of that "Letter to a friend" which Mr. Wordsworth 
published many years ago, and which is the best account 
we have of the greatest mountain excursion in England.
The weather was, however, unusual.
The guide said, 
when on the summit, " I do not know that in my 
whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so 
high upon the mountains on so calm a day." It was 
the seventh of October.
"On the summit of the Pike," says the letter, 
"which we gained after much toil, though without 
difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the 
papers containing our refreshment, as they lay spread 
out upon a rock.
The stillness seemed to be not of 
this world.
We paused, and kept silence to listen, and 
VIEW FROM SCAWEELL.
J 59 
no sound could be heard.
The Scawfell cataracts were 
voiceless to us ; and there was not an insect to hum in 
the air.
The vales which we had seen from Esk 
Hause lay yet in view, and, side by side with Eskdale, 
we now saw the sister Vale of Donnerdale terminated 
by the Duddon Sands.
But the majesty of the moun- 
tains below, and close to us, is not to be conceived.
We now beheld the whole mass of Great Gable from 
its base — the Den of Wastdale at our feet — a gulf 
immeasurable; Grasmire, and the other mountains of 
Crummock ; Ennerdale and its mountains ; and the sea 
beyond!" # # # " While we were gazing 
around, c Look,' I exclaimed, 6 at yon ship upon the 
glittering sea !
' ' Is it a ship ?
' replied our shepherd 
guide.
'It can be nothing else,' interposed my com- 
panion.
6 1 cannot be mistaken ; I am so accustomed 
to the appearance of ships at sea.' The guide dropped 
the argument ; but, before a minute was gone, he 
quietly said, ' Now, look at your ship — it is changed 
into a horse.' So it was ; a horse with a gallant neck 
and head.
We laughed heartily ; and I hope, when 
again inclined to be positive, I may remember the ship 
and the horse upon the glittering sea ; and the calm 
confidence, yet submissiveness, of our wise man of the 
mountains, who certainly had 'more knowledge of the 
clouds than we, whatever might be our knowledge of 
ships.
" I know not how long we might have remained on 
the summit of the pike, without a thought of moving, 
had not our guide warned us that we must not linger, 
for a storm was coming.
We looked in vain to espy 
160 PASSING STORM.
the signs of it.
Mountains, vales and sea were touched 
with the clear light of the sun.
' It is there !
said he, 
pointing to the sea beyond Whitehaven ' and there we 
perceived a light vapour, unnoticeable but by a shep- 
herd accustomed to watch all mountain bodings.
We 
gazed around again, and yet again, unwilling to lose 
the remembrance of what lay before us in that moun- 
tain solitude ; and then prepared to depart.
Mean- 
while, the air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny 
vapour swelled into mighty masses of cloud, which 
came boiling over the mountains.
Great Gable, Hel- 
vellyn and Skiddaw were wrapped in storm ; yet 
Langdale, and the mountains in that quarter, remained 
all bright in sunshine.
Soon the storm reached us ; 
we sheltered under a crag ; and almost as rapidly as it 
had come, it passed away, and left us free to observe 
the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quarters.
Langdale had now its share ; and the Pikes of Lang- 
dale were decorated by two splendid rainbows.
Before 
we again reached Esk Hause, every cloud had vanished 
from every summit." 
We cannot do better than stop at these auspicious 
words.
May the tourist who reads this on the Pike 
see every cloud vanish from every summit !
IV.
SCAKF GAP.
The other exit from Wastdale Head is by the road 
to Scarf Gap, already referred to as having been found 
dangerous by inexperienced travellers.
A rough foot- 
road leads through the valley of Mosedale, between 
Kirkfell and Yewbarrow, till it enters Gillerthwaite, at 
the head of Ennerdale.
Kirkfell and the stream being 
kept on the right, the track passes between Kirkfell 
and the Pillar.
Coming down into Gillerthwaite, the 
view is beautiful.
Great Gable and Kirkfell close in 
the dale at its head ; High Stile and Red Pike are in 
front, and Gillerthwaite is below, with its circular 
green level, dropped over with wood, its farmhouse and 
stream, and the lake at the other end.
Behind, the 
wild valley of Mosedale winds away between Kirkfell 
and Yewbarrow, and discloses the great summits of 
Scawfell and Bowfell.
The Pillar is 2,893 feet high, 
and inaccessible, from its craggy and precipitous 
character.
The path leads along the Pass called 
Blacksail to a sheepfold on the little river Liza, which 
falls into Ennerdale Lake : at that fold the stream will 
be crossed, and an indistinct path will be seen crossing 
a hollow in the direction of Buttermere.
That hollow 
is Scarf Gap ; and the path leads out upon Gatesgarth, 
at the head of Buttermere.
From Gatesgarth it is 
four miles to Seat oiler in Borrowdale, one mile to 
162 GATESGARTH.
Honister Crag, and two miles from the Inn at Butter- 
.mere.
As nearly as we can make out, the walk from 
Wastdale to G-atesgarth is somewhat short of twelve 
miles.
Most of it must be traversed on foot, though 
a horse may be led, to be occasionally mounted.
Y. 
GKISEDALE.
— ASCENT OF HELVELLYN.
There is a charming walk of ten miles from Patter- 
dale to Grasmere (from inn to inn) by Grisedale, which 
may as well be enjoyed by the pedestrian traveller, 
whether he chooses to ascend Helvellyn or not.
Grras- 
mere and Grisedale have the same derivation, — Gris 
being the old Saxon for wild swine : and these are 
therefore the lake and the valley of the wild boar.
A 
deep and still retreat must both have been in the days 
of wild boars.
From Patterdale, the traveller crosses Grisedale 
beck, and ascends by a steep well-wooded road to the 
table-land of Grisedale.
The old hollies in the woods 
are remarkably fine.
At every step the grandeur and 
gloom overhead increase, — the path leading directly 
under the frowning Helvellyn.
The Greenside lead 
mines are about half way up, under Striding Edge ; 
and the tourist is likely to mistake the track to the 
mines for his own road : but he must keep the stream 
to the right, — in other words, he must keep on the 
right bank of the stream for some way further.
The 
path crosses and recrosses the beck in climbing the 
steep ascent to the tarn; but there is no further 
danger of losing the track.
The view of Place Fell 
behind is fine, as seen through the steep sides of the 
dale ; and north-westwards, the mountains about the 
L 
164 GRISEDALE TARN.
Vale of Newlands are seen peeping between Seat San- 
dal, and Helvellyn.
The tarn lies under the east flank 
of Seat Sandal in a deep hollow ; and a more sweet and 
solemn resting place than Grisedale Tarn is not perhaps 
to be found among these mountains.
A wall runs along 
the ridge ; and through the gate in that wall the track 
leads down to Grasmere.
The views are gayer and 
more extensive by far than those presented by the 
other half of the pass.
The mountains seen thence 
are the Langdale Pikes and Coniston Old Man, with 
Scawfell and Bowfell predominant.
The first part of 
the descent is steep, and the latter part gradual and 
pleasant, over grass, and finally between fences and 
among farmhouses, till the path comes out upon the 
mail road, opposite Helm Crag, and some way above 
the Swan at Grasmere.
If the traveller ascends Helvellyn from Grisedale, he 
must take the road to the right, soon after entering 
the dale, in order to reach Red Tarn.
Some sturdy 
climbers go on to Grisetlale Tarn, and climb the moun- 
tain from its head : but it is best to take the road to 
Red Tarn, either by Grisedale or Glenridding, — the 
next turn from Patterdale.
It is possible to go on 
ponies to within half an hour's walk of the summit.
Red Tarn lies 600 feet immediately below the highest 
point, parted off from Grisedale by the rocky ridge of 
Striding Edge, and surmounted in the opposite direc- 
tion by the similar ridge of Swirrel Edge.
This last is 
the ridge along which the track lies, — the conical 
head of Catchedecam being its termination.
This part 
of the ascent is that which is most trying to unaccus-

tomed nerves, though there is no real danger.
It was 
in trying the other ridge, (which it is always fool- 
hardy to do,) that Charles Grough fell from the preci- 
pice, where his corpse was watched hy his dog for two 
months, till it was found.
Every one knows the story, 
as told by Wordsworth and Scott.
There are stakes 
near the tarn where horses are fastened, and then 
there is a steep scramble to the top.
There are precipices on the east of the summit ; but 
its mossy plain slopes gently towards the west.
No 
mountain in the district is, we believe, so often 
climbed.
Its central situation renders the view at- 
tractive on every account ; it is very conspicuous ; and 
it is not difficult of ascent.
According to the Ord- 
nance Surveyors, its height is 3,055 feet above the 
level of the sea ; that is, 33 feet higher than Skiddaw, 
and rather more than 100 feet lower than Scawfell 
Pike.
There are three modes of ascent from the Gras- 
mere side ; — the one by Grisedale Tarn : another from 
Wythburn ; and a third further' on from Legberthwaite.
The one from Wythburn is the shortest, but by much 
the steepest, — the track beginning at once to climb 
the hill opposite the Nag's Head.
The gushing 
stream which crosses the mail road near the Nag's 
Head comes down from Brownrigg's well, — the spring 
which refreshes the traveller on his way up or down, — 
bursting from the mountain side within 300 yards of 
the summit.
There are two cairns on two summits, 
not far apart, from between which, in an angle in the 
hill, the best view to the north is obtained.
These 
Men, (as such piles of stones are called) mark the 
l2 
166 SUMMIT OF HELVELLYIS'.
dividing line between Cumberland and Westmorland.
Northwards, the view is bounded by the Scotch moun- 
tains, with the Solway at their feet.
Nearer stands 
Saddleback, with Skiddaw a little to the left.
Kepel 
Cove Tarn lies below, with Catchedecam on the right.
Eastwards, Eed Tarn lies immediately below, between 
its two solemn precipices.
Ullswater shines beyond, 
its nearer bank fringed by Gowbarrow Park ; and 
Crossfell closes in the view afar.
The Troutbeck 
mountains here peep over Striding Edge.
Kirkstone 
and Fairfield rise to the south ; and over the latter, 
there is a peep at Windermere, and sometimes, in clear 
weather, a glimpse of Lancaster Castle.
Esthwaite 
Water and the sea in Morecambe Bay are seen at the 
same time.
Blackcombe is caught sight of through 
Wrynose Gap ; and the Coniston range and Langdale 
Pikes lead the eye round to the superior summits at 
the head of Wastdale and Buttermere.
Even Honister 
Crag is seen, in a hollow, a little to the left of Cat 
Bells.
Derwent water is not seen : nor, from the higher 
Man, either Thirlmere or Bassenthwaite ; though the 
two last are visible from the lower Man. Six lakes are 
seen, besides many tarns : — Ullswater, Windermere, 
Esthwaite Water, Coniston, Bassenthwaite and Thirl- 
mere.
Angle Tarn is particularly conspicuous, while 
its neighbour, Hays Water, is hidden in its hollow 
under High Street.
The streams it sends down to 
Brothers' Water are however, very conspicuous when 
the sun is upon them.
VI.
CONISTON OLD MAN.
— WALNA SCAR, 
There is one more which the tourist would not 
excuse our omitting.
He wants to see the copper 
mine and the series of tarns on Coniston Old Man ; 
and he hears it said, and very truly, that the prospects 
are finer than any but those from Scawfell and Helvel- 
lyn, — if not, indeed, finer than the latter.
The ascent is best made by following the Walna 
Scar road which leads from Coniston into Seathwaite.
When the traveller has left the bright and prosperous 
environs of Coniston behind him, and entered upon the 
moor, he begins to feel at once the exhilaration of the 
mountaineer.
Behind him lies a wide extent of hilly 
country, subsiding into the low blue ridges of Lanca- 
shire.
Below him he sees, when he turns, here and 
there a reach of the Lake of Coniston, — gray, if his 
walk be, as it should be, in the morning : gray, and 
reflecting the dark promontories in a perfect mirror.
Amidst the grassy undulations of the moor, he sees, 
here or there, a party of peat-cutters, with their crate : 
and their white horse, if the sun be out, looks absolutely 
glittering, in contrast with the brownness of the 
ground.
It is truly a wild moor ; but there is some- 
thing wilder to come.
The Coniston Mountain towers 
to the right, — and the only traces of human existence 
that can be perceived are the tracks which wind along 
l3 
168 ASCENT OF CONISTON OLD MAN.
and up its slopes, — the paths to the Coppermine, — 
and a solitary house, looking very desolate among its 
bare fields and fences.
The precipice called Dow (or 
Dhu) Crag appears in front ere long; and then the 
traveller must turn to the right, and get up the steep 
mountain side to the top, as he best may.
Where 
Dow Crag and the Old Man join, a dark and solemn 
tarn lies beneath the precipice, as he will see from 
above, whence it lies due west, far below.
Eound three 
sides of this Gait's Tarn, the rock is precipitous ; and 
on the other, the crags are piled in grotesque fashion, 
and so as to afford, — as does much of this side of the 
mountain, — a great harbourage for foxes, against which 
the neighbouring population are for ever waging war.
The summit is the edge of a line of rocks overhanging 
another tarn, — Low Water, — which is 2,000 feet 
above the sea level, while the summit of the Old Man 
is 2,632.
On this rock, a " Man" formerly stood ; but 
it was removed by the Ordnance Surveyors, who erected 
another, much inferior in convenience; for the first 
contained a chamber, welcome to shepherds and 
tourists overtaken by bad weather.
The mountain 
consists chiefly of a very fine roofing slate, from which 
a large tract of country is supplied, and in which a very 
important trade was formerly carried on.
Several of 
the quarries are now deserted.
From the earliest 
recorded times, there have been works here for the 
extraction of copper ; and at present it is no unusual 
thing for £2,000 per month to be paid away in wages.
The works commence at about half a-mile up the 
mountain, on its east side ; and there is a large estab- 
SUMMIT OF CONISTON OLD MAN.
169 
lishment of sheds, shops and offices, clustered at the 
upper end of a basin among the hills.
If the traveller 
desires to explore the mines, he can descend on that 
side of the mountain.
Meantime, looking abroad from 
his perch, he sees, (beginning from G-ait's Tarn) 
Devoke Water, in a line with G-ait's Tarn, to the west.
It is said that the trout in that lake are the best known ; 
and tradition declares that the comfortable abbots 
of Furness imported them from Italy.
There is a fine 
stretch of sea visible, with the Isle of Man, conspicuous 
in good weather.
We need not recapitulate the names 
of the chief mountains.
Suffice it that Ingleborough 
is visible in one direction, and Lancaster Castle again 
in another; and in clear weather, Snow don.
The 
number of tarns within view is remarkable.
We have 
mentioned Gait's Tarn and Low Water.
Beyond the 
latter lies Seathwaite Tarn, whence the infant Duddon 
issues.
Stickle Tarn is conspicuous, lying under Pavey 
Ark. In a hollow of the mountain, on its north-east 
side, lies Lowes Water.
Only the nearer lakes are 
seen ; but there is a glorious stretch of sea ; and, when 
the estuaries are full, the coast is a beautiful spectacle.
The shores of Coniston and Windermere, studded with 
woods and dwellings, are the nearer beauties.
The finest descent, though the longest, is by the 
ridge of Wetherlam, above Levers Water, descending 
into Tilberthwaite, and returning to Coniston through 
Yewdale, noticed at p.

OR, 
Mardale, by Nanbield and High Street, to Troutbeck inn, 6 miles.
There remains but one lake to be noticed, and that 
is Kawes Water, which is less visited than any other in 
the district.
It is beautiful, but rather out of the 
way, except to visitors who come by Penrith ; as they 
are usually bent on seeing at once the most celebrated 
points of scenery.
Penrith is a neat little town, busy, 
from being the great thoroughfare of the district, but 
not particularly interesting, except from some Druidical 
remains in the neighbourhood, a curiosity in the 
churchyard, and the vicinity of Brougham Castle.
The 
circle called Long Meg and her daughters is six miles 
from Penrith ; and no relic of the kind in England is 
better worth a visit.
In the churchyard of Penrith is 
the monument about which nobody really knows any 
thing, though it goes by the name of the Giant's 
Grave.
It consists of two stone pillars, with four slabs 
between them, set up on edge.
There are some unde- 
cipherable carvings on the upper part of the pillars.
This was the monument which Sir. Walter Scott's 
brougham: castle.
171 
family could not get him past, (though they had all 
seen it " dozens of times,") when, failing and infirm, 
he set out on his last sad journey, in pursuit of health.
Passing through Penrith, he would see the Giant's 
Grave ; and thither he limped, to wonder once more 
what it could mean.
The parish of Brougham, Burg-ham (meaning 
Castle-town) was the Brovacum of the Romans, where, 
as we learn from Mcolson and Burn, they had a 
company of Defensores, and left many tokens of their 
presence in antiquities which have come to light from 
time to time.
The Village of Brougham passed into 
the hands of the Veteriponts in the reign of John or 
Henry III.
The Castle of Brougham has been held 
by the Veteriponts, Cliffords and Tuftons, and is now 
the property of the Earl of Thanet.
It is now in 
ruins ; and fine ruins they are.
They stand at the 
confluence of the Eamont and Lowther Rivers, at the 
distance of a mile from Penrith.
Brougham Hall, the seat of Lord Brougham, is 
within a mile and a-half of Penrith.
The traveller 
should walk along the river bank from the bridge at 
Brougham Hall to Askham, and then ascend the steep 
bank of red sandstone, overshadowed by trees, to the 
park of Lowther Castle, The grounds here are fine ; 
especially the terrace, which affords a noble walk.
It 
is very elevated ; broad, mossy, shady, breezy, and over- 
looking a considerable extent of country, — some of 
which is fertile plain, and some undulating surface, — 
the margin of the mountain region.
The most re- 
markable feature of this landscape is perhaps the hoi- 
172 HAWES WATER.
low, within which lies Hawes Water.
The park has 
some fine old trees ; and the number and size of the 
yews in the grounds will strike the stranger.
But 
lasting injury was done to the woods by the hurricane 
of 1839, which broke its way straight through, levelling 
every thing in its path.
On the road from Askham to 
Bampton, the high grounds of Lowther present on the 
left a nearly straight line of great elevation, along 
which runs the park wall, almost to the extremity of 
the promontory.
From a distance, it looks the most 
enviable position for a park that can be imagined.
Hawes Water lies about four miles from Askham.
It is little more than three miles long, and about half 
a-mile broad.
One side is richly wooded ; the other 
nearly bare : and a pair of bold promontories threaten 
to cut it in two, in one part, where the passage is only 
two or three hundred yards wide.
Round the head of 
the lake cluster the great mountains of Harter Fell, 
High Street, Kidsty Pike and others, leaving space 
among the skirts for the exquisite little valley of Mar- 
dale.
Those who are able to obtain one of Lord 
Lonsdale's boats for the traverse of the lake may think 
themselves fortunate ; for this is, of course, the most 
perfect way of seeing the surroundings of so small a 
sheet of water : and all other persons are deprived, by 
prohibition, of the means of doing so.
There are some 
good houses on the shores and at the further end ; but 
the occupants who live on the very brink are not allowed 
to keep any sort of boat.
His lordship's boats are said 
to be procurable for the asking ; but the preliminaries 
are a hindrance.
The walk along the lake side is, how-

173 
ever, easy and agreeable enough.
The road skirts the 
western bank.
The crags which are sprinkled or 
heaped about the head of the lake are very fine.
They 
jut out from the mountain side, or stand alone on the 
green slopes, or collect into miniature mountain clus- 
ters, which shelter tiny dells, whence the sheep send 
forth their bleat.
There is a white house conspicuous 
at the head of the lake which is not the inn, how- 
ever the tired traveller may wish it were.
The inn 
at Mardale Green is a full mile from the water ; and 
sweet is the passage to it, if the walker be not too 
weary.
The path winds through the levels, round the 
bases of the knolls, past the ruins of the old church, 
and among snug little farms, while, at one end of the 
dale is the lake, and the other is closed in by the passes 
to Kentmere and Sleddale ; and the great Pikes tower 
on either hand.
The stream which gushes here and 
pauses there, as it passes among rough stones or 
through a green meadow, comes down from Small 
Water, reinforced by a brook from Blea Water on High 
Street, which joins the other a little above Mardale.
The hostess at Mardale Green Inn will make her 
guests comfortable with homely food and a clean bed : 
and the host will, if necessary, act as guide up the passes.
The small green level which from the mountains looks 
such a mere speck, is of some importance at a distance.
It actually sends 3,000 pounds of butter weekly to 
Manchester by the railway.
The carrier's waggon 
picks up the baskets from the scattered dwellings in 
the dale, and transmits no less than thirty cwts.
per 
week to the Manchester folk.
174 PASS OF NAOTIELD.
The traveller must either go back the way he came, 
or climb out of the dale at the head, whence three 
tracks branch off from the top of the pass of Nanbield.
One of these tracks turns to the left before reaching 
Small Water, and goes down into Long Sleddale, — to 
follow which we know of no sufficient inducement, 
unless it be that the way is practicable for a horse, — 
which the others are not.
Another path ascends, by 
the pretty Blea Tarn, the slope of High Street on the 
right, where the Roman road runs along the ridge.
The third goes forward past Small Water, and drops 
into Kent mere, whence it is easy to strike over the fells 
into Troutbeck.
The choice will depend much on 
weather, of course ; and we wish the traveller some- 
thing more of a choice than was permitted to us when 
we were last there, when the wind laid the whole party 
flat on the summit of the pass, and put all thought of 
High Street quite out of the question.
The account of 
the weather given by a resident not far off is " It donks 
and it dozzles ; and whiles its a bit siftering : but it 
don't often mak no girt pel." That is, — it is misty, 
and drizzles ; and it is sometimes showery ; but there 
is not often a great down pour.
The wind however 
is often strong ; and the exhaustion from a high wind 
on high ground is greater than any would believe who 
has not experienced it.
There is no difficulty in the ascent from Mardale 
Green ; but the traveller indulges in frequent rests, for 
the sake of looking back upon the singularly-secluded 
valley, with its winding stream, its faintly-marked 
track, and its little inn, recognised to the last by the 
KENTMERE.
175 
sycamores and poplars which overshadow its roof, and 
rustle before the door.
Then he comes to the hollow 
where lies the tarn, — Small Water.
Here he will rest 
again, sitting among scattered or shelving rocks, and 
drinking from this pure mountain basin.
Arrived at 
the top, he loses sight of Mardale, and greets Kent- 
mere almost at the same moment.
The dale behind is 
wild as any recess in the district : while before him lies 
a valley whose grandeur is all at the upper end, and 
which spreads out and becomes shallower with every 
mile of its recession from the great mountain cluster.
When he has gone down a mile, he finds that he is 
travelling on one side of Kentmere Tongue, — - the pro- 
jection which in this and most other valleys, splits the 
head of the dale into a fork.
When he arrives at the 
chapel, he finds that there is a carriage-road which 
would lead him forth to Staveley and Kendal.
But he 
is probably intending to go over into Troutbeck : so he 
turns up to the right, and pursues the broad zigzag 
track which leads over the Fell, till Troutbeck opens 
beneath him on the other side.
Before beginning the 
ascent, however, he will note Kentmere Hall, — the 
birthplace of Bernard Gilpin, in 1517.
If familiar 
with the old description of the district, he will look for 
Kentmere Tarn, and wonder to see no trace of it.
It 
is drained away ; and fertile fields now occupy the 
place of the swamp, reeds and shallow water which he 
might have seen but a few years ago.
While this tarn 
existed, the mills at Kendal were very irregularly sup- 
plied with water.
Now, when the streams are collected 
in a reservoir, which the traveller sees in coming down 
176 DESCENT UPON TROUTBECK.
from the pass of Nanbield, and the intercepting tarn is 
done away with, the flow of water no longer fails.
The track crosses Applethwaite common into Trout- 
beck, descending upon the chapel and the bridge in the 
very depth of that primitive valley, which was one of 
the first we described (p.
34.) We believe that in the 
whole circuit there is no scene or object of importance 
omitted in our detail.
WEATHER.
The only remaining consideration is the weather.
There is no need to observe that where there are many 
mountain tops, there must be much rain.
The Lake 
District does receive a high average of rain, as is shown 
by the following set of observations, published by Dr.
Miller of Whitehaven.

Much of the rich and verdant beauty of the region 
is derived from its frequent rains; but inexperienced 
tourists complain bitterly of them.
For the guidance 
of strangers, it may be mentioned that, generally 
speaking, the worst months of the year in the Lake

District are November and December for storms; 
March for spring gales ; and July for summer rains.
The driest season is usually for a month or more 
onwards from the middle of May. September and 
October are often very fine months.
Those who come 
but once, and take only a very cursory view, cannot be 
too careful in choosing the most favourable season for 
their trip, though to those who are familiar with the 
characteristics of this paradise, there is no aspect or 
accident of earth or sky that has not its charm.

FLOWERING PLANTS, FERNS, AND MOSSES.
WINDERMEEE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD.
The banks of Windermere afford many objects of 
interest to the lover of British wild flowers ; so numer- 
ous and various, indeed, are the more or less rare plants 
to be found in the lake itself, — in the mountain tarns, 
streams, woods and bogs, and on the fells and heath, 
that it is difficult to give a satisfactory account of them 
in the space of a short chapter.
A general description 
of the Flora of the district may, however, be of some 
use to the tourist who, in passing through the country, 
wishes to secure anything which may be worthy of a 
place in his herbarium or garden.
The writer proposes 
to enumerate the least common plants which have been 
found within about three miles of the lake, occasionally 
noticing objects of peculiar interest which are found at 
a greater distance.
Of the order Eanunculacsee, Thalictrum navum is not 
uncommon about the margin of the lake ; T.
minus 
is also found; the beautiful globe-flower Trollius 
europceus is abundant in various situations ; Helle- 
borus virdis occurs in two situations near Winder- 
mere terminus, and H.
fcetidus grows near the 
m 2 
182 FLOWERING PLANTS.
road between Bowness and Kendal : it is very pro- 
bable that both these are introduced ; Aquilegia 
vulgaris is found in numerous places.
Of Nymphceacece, Nymphcea alba and Nuphar lutea 
are frequent in the lake and many of the mountain 
tarns.
Of Papaveracea?, Meconopsis cambrica is not uncommon, 
and in some places, such as near the Ferry Inn and 
other parts of Fumess Fells, and in Troutbeck it is 
abundant ; Chelidonium majus is common.
Of Fumariacece, Corydalis claviculata is not uncommon 
in heathy places.
Of Cruciferoe, Lepidium Smithii is abundant ; L.
draba 
grows near Newby Bridge ; Arabis hirsuta is found 
on Whitbarrow ; Cochlearia officinalis on Kirkstone.
Helianthemum canum, of the order Cistaca?, occurs in 
Wither slack.
Of Droseracese, Drosera rotundifolia is abundant, and 
D. longifolia is rare.
Of Caryophyllacese, Stellaria nemorum is found in some 
wet woods and ghylls ; Silene acaulis grows on Fair- 
field.
Of Malvaceae, Malva moschata and sylvestris are 
frequent in various places.
Of Hypericacese, Hypericum androscemum is not un- 
common on wooded fellsides, generally near rivulets ; 
H. quadrangulum and humifusum are common, 
and H.
hirsutum is plentiful on Whitbarrow.
Of Geraniaieae, Geranium sylvatium is not uncommon ; 
G. lucidum is frequent ; G.
sanguineum and pratense 
are abundant on Whitbarrow.
FLOWERING PLANTS.
183 
Of Balsaminacea?, Impatiens noli me tangere is plentiful 
on Furness Fells, near the Ferry Inn, at Miller- 
ground, Gill Head, and many other places.
Of Rhamnacese, Rhamnus catharticus and frangula are 
found on the islands of Windermere.
Of Leguminiferese, Genista tinctoria is very abundant 
and beautiful in heathy places ; Hippocrepis comosa 
is found at Grange.
Of Rosacese, Prunus padus is common ; Spiraea salici- 
folia grows near the Ferry Inn, but this is doubtless 
introduced, as this plant is now found to be nowhere 
indigeneous in Great Britain ; Rubus suberectus is 
found in woods and sometimes on open mountain 
sides ; R.
saxatilis occurs in a few places ; R.
idceus 
rhamnifolius, lucostachys and rudis are the most 
common species of Rubus here ; R.
chamsemorus

In giving an account of the ferns of Windermere, 
the important discovery of Woodsia Ilvensis in West-

192 BOTANY.
CUMBEELAFD.
The Lake District, and the margin of comparatively 
level land extending to the Cumberland shore, affords 
such a scope for the natural production of plants as 
few of the English counties possess.
The great diversity of altitude,^ and consequent 
variety of climate ; the numerous and extreme changes 
of mineral and vegetable soils ; the complete circuit of 
aspect occasioned by the multiplicity and varied char- 
acter of its hills and dales ; the perfect exposure to the 
sea-breezes in some parts, and the exclusion from them 
in others ; and the very different degrees of moisture 
to which the district is subject, varying from nearly 
160 inchesf of rain-fall per annum in one or two of the 
mountain vales, to only about 24 inchesj in some of 
the lowland levels, accommodate the growth of a great 
variety of the British flora — the product of almost 
every locality between extreme anglo-alpine and the 
verge of the sea.
It is true that agricultural enterprise is quietly and 
gradualy, but surely, diminishing the numbers of the 
species ; and perhaps the monopolising avarice of pro-

fessed collectors * may aid the destructive progress not 
a little, even to the total extermination of some plants.
Still, such a range of variety is found between the 
littoral and alpine extremes of West Cumberland as 
may fairly gratify the wishes of the true botanist.
It must be understood that these remarks, and the 
following list of plants and localities, relate almost 
exclusively to the Cumberland limits of the district ; 
and that the botanical resources of that district have 
been tolerably well explored by the writer for a length- 
ened period.
His endeavours have also been aided by 
several friends (whose names are quoted) ; but it is 
still possible that some of the floral treasures may have 
been overlooked, or may yet remain undiscovered.
Those will be but few, and of course valuable when 
their localities become known.
Many common plants are omitted from the list, 
under the impression that what is open to every one's 
eye needs no record ; and numerous localities are also 
left out as redundant.
Perhaps no district, of the same limited extent, 
furnishes a more numerous assemblage of Cryptogamic 
plants ; — that least explored, but very beautiful de- 
partment ; and which may be not inappropriately 
called winter-botany.
A great proportion of the singular system of bloom- 
* Only a year or two ago, one of this class being told of the 
habitat of the rare Grammitis Ceterach, went and picked out of 
the wall in which it grew, with the point of a knife, every plant !
Fortunately, some seeds had been deposited, and they have restored 
the treasure.

ing peculiar to this class is developed at the season 
when most other vegetation is at rest, and therefore 
uninteresting; here then may the zealous botanical 
tourist still continue his study with as much ardour as 
in the summer; and derive pleasure and edification 
from the contemplation of the various gay or modest 
tints of these minute works of the Creator, when 
the casual observer will find nothing to attract his 
attention from the general dreariness of a wintry 
landscape.
Those who would acquaint themselves with the 
mosses and linchens of the lake and mountain district, 
will need some degree of perseverance and sure- 
footedness in exploring the dark ravines and cavernous 
fissures of the moist and slippery rocks, and of the 
gloomy woods where these delight to grow ; and will 
meet with perhaps the greatest variety, and those in 
the highest perfection, where the sun shines seldomest 
and the rain falls oftenest upon them.
And it should 
be remembered that no satisfactory progress can be 
made in collecting and distinguishing the cryptogamia 
when the plants are shrivelled by drought.
No little energy will be requisite, also, to hunt out 
the linchens — some of which are found inhabiting 
almost every rood of undisturbed ground from the 
verge of the ocean, to the storm-beaten summits of the 
highest mountains.
And last, not least, very consider- 
able patience is necessary to duly investigate and deci- 
pher the microscopic stamp of family, so minutely, but 
distinctly impressed upon every specific member of the 
whole tribe of both mosses and linchens ; and a great
